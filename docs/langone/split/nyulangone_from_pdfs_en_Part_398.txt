Osterman, M.H.S.,Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health StatisticsU.S. Department of Health and Human Services • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention • National Center for Health Statistics • National Vital Statistics System NCHS reports can be downloaded from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/index.htm.AbstractObjectives—This report presents provisional 2020 data on U.S. births. Births are shown by age and race and Hispanic origin of mother. Data on cesarean delivery and preterm births also are presented.Methods—Data are based on 99. of all 2020 birth records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics as of February 11, 2021. Comparisons are made with final 2019 data and earlier years.Results—The provisional number of births for the United States in 2020 was 3,605,201, down from 2019. The general fertility rate was 55.8 births per 1,000 women aged 15 44, down from 2019 to reach another record low for the United States. The total fertility rate was 1,637.5 births per 1,000 women in 2020, down from 2019 to also reach another record low for the nation. In 2020, birth rates declined for women in all age groups 15 44 and were unchanged for adolescents aged 10 14 and women aged 45 49. The birth rate for teenagers aged 15 19 declined by in 2020 to 15.3 births per 1,000 females; rates declined for both younger (aged 15 17) and older (aged 18 19) teenagers. The cesarean delivery rate rose to 31. in 2020; the low risk cesarean delivery rate increased to 25.. The preterm birth rate declined to 10. in 2020, the first decline in the rate since 2014.Keywords: birth rates • maternal and infant health • vital statistics • National Vital Statistics SystemIntroductionThis report from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is part of the National Vital Statistics System Rapid Release Quarterly Provisional Estimates. This series provides timely vital statistics for public health surveillance based on provisional data received and processed by NCHS as of a specified date. Estimates (quarterly and 12 month period ending with each quarter) for selected key vital statistics indicators are presented and released online through Quarterly Provisional Estimates ( https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/natality dashboard.htm). The series also includes reports that provide additional information on specific topics to help readers understand and interpret provisional natality and mortality data. Also, now available are provisional birth estimates developed to monitor health services utilization and maternal and infant outcomes that may be directly or indirectly impacted by COVID 19. Information is updated quarterly and is available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/covid birth.htm.Using provisional birth data for the 12 months of 2020 (1), this report supplements the Quarterly Provisional Estimates for 2020 by presenting longer temporal trends in context and more detail (by race and Hispanic origin of the mother and by state of residence). Statistics from previous provisional reports have been shown to be consistent with the final statistics for the year (2,3). This report presents provisional data on births and birth rates and cesarean delivery and preterm birth rates for the United States in 2020. Information on prenatal care, low birthweight, and other health utilization and maternal and infant risk factors is presented with final birth data for 2020.MethodsThe provisional estimates shown in this report are collected via the National Vital Statistics System (4). Findings are based on all birth records received and processed by NCHS for calendar year 2020 as of February 11, 2021; these records represent nearly (99.) of registered births occurring in 2020. Comparisons in this report are based on the final data for 2019 and earlier years (3). Data for American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands were not available as of the release of the 2020 provisional birth file. Detailed information on reporting completeness and criteria may be found elsewhere (4,5).Hispanic origin and race are reported separately on the birth certificate. Data shown by Hispanic origin include all persons of Hispanic origin of any race. Data for non Hispanic persons are shown separately for each single race group. Data by race are based on the revised standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 1997 (6). The race and Hispanic origin groups shown are: non Hispanic, single race white; non Hispanic, single race black; non Hispanic, single race American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN); non Hispanic, single race Asian; non Hispanic, single race Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI); and Hispanic. For brevity, text references to race omit the term “single race” (3).U.S. Department of Health and Human Services • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention • National Center for Health Statistics • National Vital Statistics System2Vital Statistics Surveillance ReportBirth and fertility rates for the United States and by maternal race and Hispanic origin for 2020 were based on population estimates derived from the 2010 census as of July 1, 2020 (7).Changes and differences presented in this report are statistically significant at the 0.05 level, unless noted otherwise. For information and discussion on computing rates and percentages and for detailed information on items presented in this report, see “User Guide to the 2019 Natality Public Use File” (4).Beginning with Quarterly Provisional Estimates for Quarter 3, 2020, the use of record weights for provisional birth data was discontinued (1,5). This change was implemented because of the recent high levels of completeness of provisional birth data; the change in weighting had limited, if any, impact on the provisional birth estimates. Data shown in this report are based directly on the counts of all (unweighted) birth records received and processed by NCHS as of February 11, 2021.ResultsBirths and birth ratesKey findings, illustrated in Tables 1 3 and Figures 1 and 2, show:■The provisional number of birthsfor the United States in 2020 was3,605,201, down from the numberin 2019 (3,747,540) (Tables 1 3 andFigure 1). This is the sixth consecutiveyear that the number of births hasdeclined after an increase in 2014,down an average of per year, andthe lowest number of births since 1979(3,8,9).■From 2019 to 2020, the provisionalnumber of births declined forHispanic women, for non Hispanicwhite and non Hispanic black women, for non Hispanic AIAN women,and for non Hispanic Asian women(Tables 2 and 3). The decline inthe number of births for non HispanicNHOPI women was not significant.■The provisional general fertility rate(GFR) for the United States in 2020was 55.8 births per 1,000 women aged15 44, down from the rate in 2019(58.3), another record low for the nation(Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1) (3,8,9).From 2014 to 2020, the GFR declinedby an average of per year.■GFRs declined for each of therace and Hispanic origin groupsfrom 2019 to 2020, down fornon Hispanic NHOPI women; fornon Hispanic white, non Hispanicblack, and Hispanic women; fornon Hispanic AIAN women; and for non Hispanic Asian women.Figure 2.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention • National Center for Health Statistics • National Vital Statistics System3Vital Statistics Surveillance Report ■The provisional total fertility rate (TFR) for the United States in 2020 was 1,637.5 births per 1,000 women, down from the rate in 2019 (1,706.0), another record low for the nation (3,9,10). The TFR estimates the number of births that a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their lifetimes, based on the age specific birth rate in a given year. ■The TFR in 2020 was again below replacement—the level at which a given generation can exactly replace itself (2,100 births per 1,000 women). The rate has generally been below replacement since 1971 and has consistently been below replacement since 2007 (3,8,9).Maternal age ■Provisional birth rates declined for women in all age groups 15 44 from 2019 to 2020 and were unchanged for adolescents aged 10 14 and women aged 45 49 (Table 1). ■The provisional birth rate for teenagers in 2020 was 15.3 births per 1,000 females aged 15 19, down from 2019 (16.7), reaching another record low for this age group (Table 1 and Figure 2) (3,8 10). The rate has declined by since 2007 (41.5), the most recent period of continued decline, and since 1991, the most recent peak. The rate declined an average of annually from 2007 to 2020 (3,8). The number of births to females aged 15 19 was 157,548 in 2020 (Table 1), down from 2019 (3,8 10). ■The provisional birth rates for teenagers aged 15 17 and 18 19 in 2020 were 6.3 and 28.8 births, respectively, down by and from 2019, again reaching record lows for both groups (3,8 10). From 2007 to 2020, the rates for teenagers aged 15 17 and 18 19 declined by and per year, respectively (3,8). ■The provisional birth rate for females aged 10 14 was 0.2 births per 1,000 in 2020, unchanged since 2015. ■The provisional birth rate for women aged 20 24 in 2020 was 62.8 births per 1,000 women, down from 2019 (66.6), reaching yet another record low for this age group (Table 1) (3,8,9). This rate has declined by since 2007. The number of births to women in their early 20s also declined by from 2019 to 2020 (Table 1). ■The provisional birth rate for women aged 25 29 was 90.0 births per 1,000 women, down from 2019 (93.7), reaching another record low for this age group (3,8,9). The number of births to women in their late 20s declined from 2019 to 2020. ■The provisional birth rate for women aged 30 34 in 2020 was 94.8 births per 1,000 women, down from 2019 (98.3) (Table 1) (3,8,9). The number of births to women in this age group declined by from 2019 to 2020. ■The provisional birth rate for women aged 35 39 was 51.7 births per 1,000 women, down from 2019 (52.8). The number of births to women in this age group declined by from 2019 to 2020. ■The provisional birth rate for women aged 40 44 in 2020 was 11.8 births per 1,000 women, down from 2019 (12.0). The rate for this age group had risen almost continuously from 1985 to 2019, by an average of per year (3,8). The number of births to these women was essentially unchanged from 2019 to 2020. ■The provisional birth rate for women aged 45 49 (which includes births to women aged 50 and over) was 0.9 births per 1,000 women, unchanged since 2015. However, the number of births to women in this age group declined from 2019 to 2020 (Table 1).Maternal and infant health characteristicsKey findings, illustrated in Tables 3 and 4 and Figure 3, show:Cesarean delivery ■In 2020, the overall cesarean delivery rate increased to 31. from 31. in 2019 (Tables 3 and 4); despite this increase, the rate had generally declined from 2009 (32.) to 2019 (3). See Table 4 for state specific rates. ■From 2019 to 2020, cesarean delivery rates increased for non Hispanic white (30. to 30.), non Hispanic black (35. to 36.), non Hispanic NHOPI (30. to 32.), and Hispanic (31. to 31.) women; declines in rates for non Hispanic AIAN (28. to 28. ) and non Hispanic Asian (32. to 32.) women were not statistically significant. ■The low risk cesarean delivery rate, or cesarean delivery among nulliparous (first birth), term (37 or more completed weeks based on the obstetric estimate), singleton (one fetus), vertex (head first) births, also increased in 2020, to 25. from 25. in 2019 (Table 3). ■Low risk cesarean rates increased from 2019 to 2020 for non Hispanic white (24. to 24.), non Hispanic black (30. to 30.), non Hispanic NHOPI (26. to 29.), and Hispanic (24. to 25.) women; increases for non Hispanic AIAN (22. to 23.) and non Hispanic Asian (27. to 27.) women were not significant.Preterm birth ■The preterm birth rate declined to 10. in 2020 from 10. in 2019 (Table 3 and Figure 3), the first decline in this rate since 2014. The percentage of infants born preterm (births at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation) fell from 2007 (the most recent year for which national data are available based on the obstetric estimate of gestation [11]) to 2014, then rose from 2014 (9.) to 2019 (3). See Table 4 for state specific rates.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention • National Center for Health Statistics • National Vital Statistics System4Vital Statistics Surveillance Report ■Declines were observed in both early preterm (less than 34 completed weeks of gestation) and late preterm births (34 36 weeks) from 2019 to 2020 (Table 3). The early preterm rate declined from 2. to 2., the lowest level reported since at least 2007 (11). The late preterm rate declined from 7. to 7. (Figure 3). ■The preterm birth rate declined among births to non Hispanic Asian women (8. to 8.), among non Hispanic white women (9. to 9.), and among Hispanic women (9. to 9.) from 2019 to 2020; changes for births to non Hispanic AIAN (11. to 11.), non Hispanic black (14. to 14.), and non Hispanic NHOPI (11. to 11.) women were not significant. ■Late preterm births declined among non Hispanic Asian (6. to 6.) and non Hispanic white mothers (6. to 6.), but changes for non Hispanic black (9. to 9.), non Hispanic AIAN (8. to 8.), non Hispanic NHOPI (8. to 8.), and Hispanic (7. to 7.) mothers were not significant. Early preterm births were down for the three largest race and Hispanic origin groups (non Hispanic white, non Hispanic black, and Hispanic), but were not significantly changed for the others (Table 3).References1.
