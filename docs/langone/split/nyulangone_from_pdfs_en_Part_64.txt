organization invests heavily in system wide programs and scalable capital im­provement projects such as LED retrofits, computer power management, state of the art equipment like ultra efficient chiller plants and on site cogeneration, and deep retrofits of energy systems to increase resiliency and reliability. These high impact projects are paired with continuous monitoring and building automation to make sure that systems are functioning optimally.In fiscal year 2023, NYU Langone Health achieved $11.7 million in energy savings (not including cogeneration plant savings) with a single year return on investment of . Fiscal year 2024 energy savings is still being evaluated. Since 2008, the program has achieved over $76 million in net program savings with a return on investment. In addition, through Q4 2024, the institution earned a record $2.8 million in annual revenue for the demand response program, which sheds electrical load during times of high grid stress and helps prevent local brownouts and blackouts. This pro­gram alone has led to $13 million in revenue since its inception in 2014. The Energy & Sustainability team was also able to secure nearly $0.8 million in grants and incentives in fiscal year 2023 to help fund its energy conservation projects.Other Key Initiatives and Achievements•In addition to pursuing high impact opportunities, the NYU Langone Health engineering and commissioning team standardizes efficient engineering designs across all renovation and new construction projects and ensures NYU Langone Health is delivering on its sustainability goals. These standards include a U.S. Green Building Council LEED Gold minimum certification, with five certified projects totaling 1.6 million square feet of space. In 2024, NYU Lan­gone Health’s ambulatory care center in Garden City, which is the institution’s largest ambulatory site to date on Long Island with 260,000 square feet, achieved LEED Silver certification. •NYU Langone Health has a thriving urban honeybee program to support the local ecosystem and pollination. It hosts three hives located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island. The hives produce 220 pounds of hyperlocal honey that is harvested and is sold in gift shops and farmers markets.•For Earth Month in April 2024, the Sustainability team partnered with Partnerships for Parks to host NYU Langone Health’s first tree planting event where over 30 employees and their families volunteered at a NYC public park in Manhattan.•In 2024, NYUGSOM published its first Planetary Health Report Card, a metric based tool to track, share, and identi­fy institutional opportunities for climate integration in curriculum, research, advocacy, and infrastructure.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 19Community Benefits•In 2024, NYU Langone Health was named the U.S. and North American winner of the Schneider Sustainability Im­pact Awards and received 7 environmental excellence awards from Practice Green health and Health Care Without Harm, including Top 10 in Green Buildings. Over the past 10 years, NYU Langone Health has earned more than 85 energy and environmental excellence awards for its leading sustainability efforts.•NYU Langone Health is an active member of the U.S. Health Care Climate Council, a network organization member of the National Academy of Medicine’s Action Collaborative on Decarbonizing the U.S. Health Sector, and a partici­pant in the International Health Care Climate Challenge and Healthier Hospitals Safer Chemicals Challenge, among other partnerships and commitments.•In late 2023, NYU Langone Health donated over 400 clinical and lab coats to Material for the Arts, a creative reuse center run by the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs. This material is made available, free of charge, to NYC public schools, city agencies, and nonprofits with arts programming within NYC.•NYU Langone Health partners with Summit Ridge Energy and serves as the sole off taker of the utility credits gen­erated by two 4 megawatts battery storage projects on Staten Island. Those projects, which were energized, com­missioned and began generating power in fall 2023, help reduce both carbon emissions and grid demand during peak hours. This partnership has a way of demonstrating the role that large end users, such as hospitals, can play in the decarbonization of New York’s energy grid and increasing the resiliency of the community.NYU Langone Health is rooted in its tripartite mission to care, teach, and discover. Fulfillment of these missions is not limited to the physical bounds of the NYU Langone Health campuses but extends into the surrounding neighborhoods to care for the communities in which NYU Langone Health operates. To that end, in fiscal year 2023, NYU Langone Health contributed approximately $2.7 billion in Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) defined community benefits to fund charity and underfunded care, physician training, research support, and other community health investments. The impact of NYU Langone Health’s fiscal year 2024 investment in the community is still being evaluated. $2 billionCharity & Underfunded CareCharity: $88 millionGovernmental payors: $1.8 billionOther unsubsidized care: $64 million$662 millionPhysician Training and ResearchEducation and Training: $298 millionMedical Research Funding: $364 million$87 millionCommunity Health ContributionsCommunity Health Improvements: $36 millionCash in Kind: $50 millionEnvironmental Improvements & Other Community Support : $1 millionNYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT20In addition to assisting patients by providing financial support, NYU Langone Health aims to promote equity in health outcomes and build an inclusive culture of medi­cine by aiding vulnerable populations. In April 2024, NYU Langone Radiology Fort Hamilton opened in Southwest Brooklyn providing a location for breast imaging, breast biopsies, and bone density testing. This location provides a patient centered space for critical preventative and diagnostic services as part of NYU Lan­gone Health’s commitment to the Brooklyn community. The physicians and staff at NYU Langone Radiology Fort Hamilton work collaboratively with the Perlmutter Cancer Center locations in Brooklyn to ensure patients receive timely care and treatment for breast cancer and other diagnoses.NYU Langone Brooklyn continues to expand programs that are responsive to the needs of the Brooklyn commu­nity. In November 2023, NYU Langone Brooklyn received approval from NYS DOH to begin an adult cardiac surgery program. After significant operational planning, this pro­gram will go live in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 in full collaboration with the cardiac surgery programs in Manhattan and Long Island under the umbrella of NYU Langone Health. The goal of this program is to provide the highest quality cardiac surgery services close to where patients live, therefore reducing the travel burden on patients. In addition, with the implementation of cardiac surgery, NYU Langone Brooklyn will expand electrophysi­ology services to meet the needs of patients with cardiac rhythm disorders.In Sunset Park, Brooklyn and other neighborhoods served by NYU Langone Brooklyn, care for the elderly is a grow­ing concern as the population ages. Seniors make up approximately of the patients admitted to NYU Lan­gone Brooklyn’s emergency department and falls account for about of such patients’ injuries. NYU Langone Hospitals’ geriatrics department, which ranked No. 2 in the 2024 25 U.S. News & World Report “Best Geriatrics Hospitals” survey, is exploring ways to reduce the trau­matic impact of falls. By designing a clinical protocol for seniors with fall related injuries who come to the emer­gency department (the “Geriatric Trauma Program”), NYU Langone Brooklyn’s Level I Trauma Center is working to improve the level of care that seniors receive. The scope of services provided to the Brooklyn com­munity has significantly expanded since NYU Langone Hospitals’ 2016 merger with Lutheran Medical Center. Such services include electrophysiologic diagnostic and interventional treatment for dysrhythmias, gynecologic surgical oncology, advanced endovascular neurosurgical care, advanced percutaneous interventions for coronary artery disease, specialized care for neurologic critical care, and endocrine specialty care. Robotic surgery was introduced at the time of the merger, and volume has in­creased every year since, with surgeons performing 1,181 robotic procedures at NYU Langone Brooklyn in fiscal year 2024. These advanced surgical techniques provide for significantly shorter recovery times compared to conventional approaches. NYU Langone Brooklyn not only provides clinical care to the community, but also strives to improve the health of the community through addressing social determinants of health and closing health equity gaps. Examples include expanding its internal medicine residency training program to incorporate a curriculum that addresses the social determinants of health, cre­ating a community based psychiatry residency training program to focus on training future psychiatrists to care for underserved and immigrant communities, and signifi­cantly expanding efforts to engage patients from diverse backgrounds in research that focuses on improving health outcomes. Twenty two new research studies have opened in the past year with over half of participants speaking a primary language other than English.In March 2023, the Latino Liver Program was launched, which aims to help reduce health disparities within the region’s large and growing Latino population by offering linguistically and culturally conscious liver care while actively seeking referrals from other providers. Among people of Hispanic and Latino ethnicity in the United States, the rate of chronic liver disease is roughly two fold higher than it is for the non Hispanic, White population. Similar disparities exist for rates of liver cancer diagno­ses and deaths. Even so, Hispanic and Latino people are referred to liver transplant centers, evaluated, and added to liver transplant waitlists at significantly lower rates than their non Hispanic White counterparts. Modeled on pre existing Asian liver health programs at NYU Langone Health and elsewhere, the Latino Liver Program has grown to include about a dozen providers who work collabora­tively to care for patients with liver cancer or other acute or chronic diseases or help them navigate the long and complicated transplantation process. One major goal is to address why Latino people, who make up the second largest demographic in New York City, are not represented in similar numbers in liver evaluations and transplant lists. Beyond a lack of access to primary and specialty care, in many cases, patients may be referred to medical centers where language and cultural barriers interfere with their continuum of care. To help overcome those hurdles, the program is allocating significant resources beyond Man­hattan and reaching out to gastroenterologists and other providers in the region to create more awareness and increase referrals.NYU Langone Hospitals continues to work to innovate care delivery strategies that meet patient needs by devel­oping programs that include partnering with community health workers and faith based groups to treat high blood pressure in South Asian and Black communities, bring­ing behavioral healthcare to underserved populations in Brooklyn, and reopening the free, medical student run community health clinic on Long Island. Additionally, theCommunity Investments in Brooklyn and QueensNYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 21The FHC’s Community Medicine Program provides healthcare to adults at 10 residential shelters throughout New York City for people experiencing housing issues, transitional living, or homelessness. Care teams include a registered nurse, physician or nurse practitioner, psychiatric specialist, social worker, and care manager. The Nurse in Shelter program was created with the Department of Homeless Services to advance healthcare accessibility for the city’s homeless pop­ulation by conducting screenings in shelters without clinics and connecting patients to healthcare services. In April 2023, NYU Langone Health opened the Joseph S. and Diane H. Steinberg Ambulatory Care Center, which builds upon the existing standalone emergency department by adding access to multiple specialties, including cancer care, pediatric care, outpatient surgeries, and other physician practices in Brooklyn’s Cobble Hill neighborhood. Since opening, the number of patients treated each day in the emergency department continues to rise, with the total volume exceeding 48,000 visits in the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. In addition, the number of ambulance arrivals has increased, with over 9,500 arrivals in the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. As a consequence of the rise in the emergency department volume, patients observed and admitted to NYU Langone Brooklyn or NYU Langone Hospitals’ Manhattan campus totaled more than 4,400 admissions for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. With the ability to receive critically ill patients, the critical care transfers from NYU Langone staffed and local 911 ambulances account for of emergency department arrivals. This has allowed for more immediate care for the sickest patients, including those from Red Hook, Brooklyn. The Steinberg Ambulatory Care Center has two, fully operationalized operating rooms with a total case volume of 7,575 procedures for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. These procedures have been successfully performed by 56 different surgeons across 15 specialties, including robotic surgery. Community Investments in Suffolk CountySince the affiliation with LICH in March 2022, NYU Lan­gone Health has dedicated substantial time and resources towards improving operations at LICH. In order to build a reliable network of high quality providers and broaden the range of services available to the surrounding community, NYU Langone Health has transitioned LICH physicians into the FGP, recruited over 125 FGP doctors of varying specialties, and opened multiple ambulatory practices, in­cluding a new infusion center that sees over 1,100 elective visits each week. NYU Langone Health has also brought its best operational practices to LICH, designed to improve survival rates, reduce complications, and reduce length of stay. NYU Langone Health has dedicated these resources and practices with the objective of aligning the quality of care provided at LICH with the patient centered, quality care provided at all NYU Langone Health locations. NYU Langone Health has also integrated LICH patient data into Epic, and transitioned LICH’s general ledger, supply chain management, and human capital management systems into NYU Langone Health’s PeopleSoft environment. LICH’s CON application to construct an ambulatory sur­gery center in Patchogue was approved by the NYS DOHFHC’s School Based Dental Health Program offers children access to dental care in 59 public schools citywide. Annu­ally, the program provides free comprehensive dentistry and oral health education for approximately 25,000 students. The program, which recently expanded into Queens with four new sites in the Rockaways and Corona Park, meets the needs of children seen through the FHC’s school based clinics.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT22and construction is underway. The new ambulatory sur­gery center will include six operating rooms and four pro­cedure rooms to meet current and future surgical volume. In fiscal year 2023, South Shore Neurologic Associates joined NYU Langone Health’s ambulatory care network, bringing an additional 20,000 patients and 200 employ­ees into NYU Langone Health. Locations in Patchogue, Riverhead, and Islip offer a wide range of neurologic care, including diagnostic testing, physical therapy, and pain management, to meet the needs of a diverse patient pop­ulation in Suffolk County.In February 2024, Long Island Anesthesia Physicians joined the NYU Langone Health network. Currently the exclusive anesthesia provider at LICH, this partnership meets the increased need for anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists who can support NYU Langone Health’s growing patient volume, procedures, and surgeries. With the addition of Long Island Anesthesia Physicians, NYU Langone Health now relies on a team of over 40 anesthesiologists, 100 certified registered nurse anesthe­tists, and two nurse practitioners to meet the growing de­mands of patient care while striving to improve efficiency, quality, and consistency. This partnership aligns with NYU Langone Health’s strategic goals of expanding services, including the development of an ambulatory surgery center in Patchogue and other future growth initiatives in both Suffolk and Nassau counties.In February 2024, LICH hosted a full scale Mass Casu­alty Incident (“MCI”) exercise in partnership with South Country Ambulance Company and other Suffolk County businesses and municipal agencies. The MCI drill provided a learning opportunity to validate LICH’s disaster plan and provided a no fault environment to increase LICH’s read­iness to respond to and manage multiple victims from an incident involving gunshot wound trauma. Exercise ac­tivities included testing real time notifications, activating the MCI response protocols, mobilizing departments to support the emergency department, triage, patient place­ment, patient registration and tracking via Epic Disaster Mode, decanting, and surgery prioritization.LICH also works with local emergency medical service providers on the Suffolk County MCI Plan, and provides Narcan training, diabetes education programs, advanced Trauma Life Support Certification, and injury and fall pre­vention courses to municipal partners.The statistics on the NYS DOH Opioid Dashboard report that for 2023, there were 21 opioid related overdose deaths per 100,000 residents in Suffolk County com­pared to 13 opioid related overdose deaths per 100,000 residents on average in New York State. There was also a surge in mental health issues and suicides, particularly among the youth population. LICH offers biweekly men­tal health education for family and friends of individuals struggling with mental illness as well as substance use disorders. LICH has six primary care centers recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance as a pa­tient centered medical home, which is a patient centered approach to care, with the ability to provide assessments to patients experiencing behavioral health or substance abuse issues. LICH also provides medical assisted treat­ment services for substance abuse for those willing to accept treatment. Moreover, LICH’s patient chemical de­pendency program is licensed under the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services. The program provides assessment, treatment, education, and linkage to other community services for patients 18 years and older. NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 23Charity and Underfunded CareNYU Langone Health is committed to ensuring that its care is not limited to those who have insurance coverage or the means to pay for care. NYU Langone Health recognizes that there are times when patients in need of care will have difficulty paying for the services provided. Accordingly, NYU Langone Health has implemented a discount policy and financial aid program that is consistent with the mission, values, and capacity of NYU Langone Health, while considering an individual’s ability to contribute to their care. In fiscal year 2024, more than two thirds of inpatients were enrolled in a government spon­sored insurance plan: Medicare, Medicaid, and self pay. NYU Langone Health’s charity care policy, in accordance with the NYS DOH’s guidelines, ensures the provision of health care services to the community served while considering the ability of the patient to pay. The policy has sliding fee schedules for inpatient, ambulatory, and emergency services provided to the uninsured and under insured patients that qualify. NYU Langone Health provides discounts for eligible patients up to of the Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”) and lower discounts for eligible patients up to of the FPL. Total charges associated with providing care to charity patients for the year ended August 31, 2024 was $488.6 million. NYU Langone Health determines the cost of providing these services based on a ratio of cost to charges.Further, New York State regulations provide for the distribution of funds from an indigent care pool, which is intended to partially offset the cost of uncompensated care and services provided to uninsured patients. NYU Langone Health paid $84.8 million and $77.7 million into the indigent care pool for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively, but only received $61.3 million and $56.9 million in pool distributions for those periods, leaving an unreimbursed contribution to the pools of $23.5 million and $20.8 million. In addition, and of NYU Langone Health’s discharged patients during the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 and Au­gust 31, 2023, respectively, were uninsured or insured through government payors. NYU Langone Health incurs material costs in treating those patients and does so at a loss given the shortfall in both Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.

Through August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, NYU Langone Hospitals provided $231.6 million and $178.4 million, respectively, of funding to support research and education operations at the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine. The goal of this investment is to make new discoveries and generate knowledge to further health outcomes. In May 2021, NYUGSOM was awarded a NIH grant to study the long term effects of the COVID 19 infection. Se­lected as the Clinical Science Core (“CSC”) for NIH’s $1.15 billion Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (“RECOV­ER”) initiative, NYU Langone Health leads and integrates the research activities of 35 research hubs and more than 100 sub sites around the country. Since the launch of the study, NYUGSOM has been awarded $489.8 million, which is subcontracted from NYUGSOM to the research hubs and their sub sites, and $51.6 million in grant funding for CSC activities. In September 2024, NYUGSOM was awarded an additional $109.5 million to support initia­tives at the adult and pediatric sites through the award’s current end date of May 2025. Both the revenue and ex­pense of the CSC, including for activities subcontracted to research hubs, pass through the Statement of Operations of NYU Langone Health, but are for substantially offsetting amounts and do not have a material effect on operating margin.NYU Langone Health believes the best way to prepare physicians for any career in medicine is to provide care for culturally and socioeconomically diverse patient populations in a variety of clinical settings. NYU Langone Hospitals operates a graduate medical education pro­gram in more than 150 medical residency and fellowship training programs, employing more than 1,300 residents and fellows. The programs offer hands on clinical training to medical degree graduates under the supervision of the faculty of the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine where residents encounter and treat a broad range of patients and diseases. As previously noted, both NYU Grossman Schools of Med­icine offer full tuition scholarships to all students enrolled in the MD degree program. These scholarships address the rising costs of medical education, help to attract the best and brightest students to careers in medicine, and make attending medical school available to a broader range of applicants. These scholarships supported over $26.9 million and $26.1 million, respectively, of financial aid in fiscal year 2024 and 2023. While these scholarships were funded in part by NYU Grossman Schools of Medi­cine endowments, NYU Langone Hospitals also provided $26.5 million and $25.5 million in support to fund teach­ing activities through fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respec­tively.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT26Obligated Group Financial HighlightsDays Cash on Hand CalculationThe table below sets forth the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group’s and the LICH Credit Group’s days’ cash on hand calculated pursuant to their respective Master Indenture definitions:Days cash on hand for the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group decreased to 144 days as of August 31, 2024, com­pared to 164 days as of August 31, 2023. The decrease in days cash on hand was primarily driven by capital expendi­tures to support strategic capital investments and support NYUGSOM for building and other capital acquisitions, offset by cash received from the 340B settlement and cash generated from operations. Days cash on hand for the LICH Credit Group increased to 72 days as of August 31, 2024, compared to 56 days as of August 31, 2023. The increase in cash and investments is a result of $48.5 million in cash generated from operations, $9.4 million generated from asset sales and divestitures of minority interest investments and $5.9 million of invest­ment gains, partially offset by expenditures of $32.1 million to support LICH’s capital investment and the repayment of $6.9 million in intercompany payables. Debt Service Coverage RatioThe decrease in the debt service ratio from the prior comparative period is primarily due to a reduction in one time items included in income available for debt service. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2023, the excess of rev­enue over expenses includes the settlement payment of $508.0 million from Turner Construction Company for unre­covered losses suffered from Superstorm Sandy. There are no similarly material one time items recorded in the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. The table below sets forth the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group’s debt service coverage ratio.
