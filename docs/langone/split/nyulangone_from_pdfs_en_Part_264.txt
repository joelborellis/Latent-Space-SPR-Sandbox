External glass louvers on the south facade mitigate direct sun and glare while allowing daylight to penetrate the interior labs and preserving views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn skyline. Occupancy sensors, high efficiency lighting with daylight dimming, and task lighting at the lab benches reduce the electrical loads from lighting. Rain water is collected from the roofs and retained for reuse for irrigation and low flow flush fixtures. High efficiency lab equipment, VAV fume hoods, and active chilled beams provide occupant comfort and reduce energy consumption, while dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) with heat recovery provide outside air.* Illustration courtesy of Atelier TenEnvironmental StrategiesNSUSTAINABLE SITESWATER EFFICIENCYENERGY & ATMOSPHERE23 / 268 / 1026 / 35MATERIALS & RESOURCESINDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITYINNOVATION IN DESIGN7 / 1411 / 156 / 6REGIONAL PRIORITY3 / 4Encourage Alternative Transportation Installed 54 bike racks and bike commuting shower facilityReduce Heat Island Effect The weighted average roof area for the combined SRI compliant and vegetated roofing surfaces is greater than or equal to the total building roof area.Light colored and vegetated site and roof areas contribute reduce the heat island effectPublic Transportation Access Locate project within 1/4 mile of four bus linesMaximize Open Space The open space provided is equal to 53. of the total site areaKIMMELPAVILIONFERRY TERMINALENERGYBUILDINGSMILOWTISCH HOSPITALSKIRBALLINSTITUTEMSBALUMNIHALLSCIENCEBUILDINGSCHWARTZ HEALTHCARE CENTER6TO SUBWAY6TO SUBWAYNYU Langone Health Science BuildingThe NYU Langone Health Science Building is located on the East Side of Manhattan on the southeast corner of the institution’s campus.

While the whole building energy consumption profile is driven by internal loads and ventilation requirements typical for a laboratory building, high performance glazing and external shading strategies contribute towards energy savings, and they are critical in maintaining optical indoor environmental quality.* Daylight analysis courtesy of Atelier TenSouth Facade Energy Savings The external shades and frit are very effective in reducing solar heat gain in the labs, and greatly reduce annual hours of glare (). The external shades and frit greatly reduce the perimeter daylight levels and the daylight zone to approximately 14 feet from the south facade Figure 1: Annual Site Energy Baseline Design and Proposed Design 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000160,000ASHRAE 90.1 2007Baseline DesignProposed Design Space Cool Heat Reject.
