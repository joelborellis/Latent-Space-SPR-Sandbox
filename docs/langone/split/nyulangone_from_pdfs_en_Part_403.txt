Interactive digital sign types provide wayfinding information, physician directory information, and regulatory documents. All content for digital sign types is translated and available in NYU Langone required languages. 2.2.1© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualDIGITAL SIGN TYPE OVERVIEWDigital Sign TypesPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES: SIGN LOCATIONSAlthough unique architectural conditions may compromise the ideal sign locations, programming should consider the following:The NYU Langone Health Stakeholders should be consulted for the function and needs of the signs for their facilities. Visibility should be studied, especially for overhead sign types, where architectural elements may create viewing obstacles.If deemed appropriate, multiple sign panels with the same installation height may be installed side by side with 3" space between panels.Over signing should be avoided so as not to overwhelm patients and visitors and to alleviate visual clutter.Custom Interior Sign Types (Chapter 4) have been designed for use in high traffic public corridors. Consideration should be given to the nature of the location when determining the use of Custom Sign Types. Material and Paint Finishes should be coordinated with the NYU Langone Health Design Team and their consultants.2.3.1© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualPROGRAMMING GUIDELINESCustom Interior Sign Types (Chapter 4) should be used at the Main Campus on the first floor corridors designated as wayfinding pathways (i.e. Green Pathway, Blue Pathway, Yellow Pathway). These sign types are intended to reinforce the wayfinding strategy at the Main Campus.Modular Interior Sign Types (Chapter 5) should be used throughout the Main Campus. These sign types are used for room identification, regulatory information, and upper level wayfinding. All modular signs programmed to be located on a first floor corridor designated as a wayfinding pathway (i.e. Green Pathway, Blue Pathway, Yellow Pathway) should correspond to the Pathway paint finish. For all other locations at the Main Campus, F2 (Standard Neutral) should be specified. PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES: MAIN CAMPUS FINISHESBlue PathwayYou are on theTisch ElevatorsKimmel ElevatorsHassenfeld ElevatorsPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES: HASSENFELD FINISHESCustom Interior Sign Types incorporating the Hassenfeld Brand should be employed at entrances and reception areas of all Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital areas. Refer to Chapter 4 for the design requirements of these sign types.Certain Modular Interior Sign Types can be modified to incorporate the Hassenfeld Brand. These modified sign types should be used for patient facing room identification, regulatory information, and wayfinding at all Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital areas. When creating sign location plans and documentation, maintain the typical Chapter 5 Sign Type designation and refer to Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for layout and finish modifications.2.3.2© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualPROGRAMMING GUIDELINESJ2 L4 056K1 L4 064J2 L4 062J2 L4 061J2 L4 055J1 L4 060J1 L4 059J1 L4 052G1 L4 058J1 L4 051H4 L4 087H4 L4 092K2 L4 137H4 L4 011H4 L4 013K1 L4 155E4 L4 156U1 L4 163H4 L4 138H4 L4 009H4 L4 085K2 L4 093K2 L4 095K2 L4 099K2 L4 101H4 L4 103K2 L4 084H4 L4 088H4 L4 091K2 L4 142H4 L4 012H4 L4 014K1 L4 153E4 L4 154W2 L4 162J1 L4 161A3 L4 047K2 L4 134H4 L4 135K2 L4 136H4 L4 143J2 L4 160R5 L4 004VV1 L4 165VV2 L4 166T1 L4 003Q1 L4 168F2 L4 005X1 L4 006X2 L4 176X3 L4 007X3 L4 169B6 L4 001A1 L4 002X3 L4 174B7 L4 140B7 L4 049K1 L4 146J1 L4 148J2 L4 159J2 L4 017H4 L4 019H4 L4 015H4 L4 016J1 L4 018J1 L4 020J2 L4 021T2 L4 173K1 L4 034W2 L4 037W2 L4 030W2 L4 024W2 L4 008K2 L4 035K2 L4 036X3 L4 038H4 L4 040J1 L4 039J1 L4 043H4 L4 041H4 L4 042J1 L4 033J1 L4 170J2 L4 172J1 L4 044J1 L4 046T2 L4 045U1 L4 027VV2 L4 167K2 L4 026K2 L4 032B7 L4 171K2 L4 022K2 L4 028K2 L4 025K2 L4 031K2 L4 023K2 L4 029J2 L4 158J2 L4 157J1 L4 147J1 L4 150J1 L4 149J1 L4 151J2 L4 145K2 L4 141H4 L4 010K2 L4 133K2 L4 086K2 L4 094K2 L4 096K2 L4 100K2 L4 102K2 L4 104J1 L4 098J1 L4 097J1 L4 083W2 L4 050W2 L4 089J1 L4 053J1 L4 057J1 L4 054J1 L4 065J1 L4 068E5 L4 076E5 L4 069E5 L4 070E5 L4 071E5 L4 072E5 L4 075E5 L4 074E5 L4 073H4 L4 066H4 L4 109H4 L4 110H4 L4 111H4 L4 115K2 L4 126W2 L4 125H4 L4 123H4 L4 121H4 L4 124H4 L4 119W2 L4 139W2 L4 132W2 L4 152K2 L4 127H4 L4 128H4 L4 129K2 L4 130K2 L4 131W2 L4 116W2 L4 090K2 L4 112K2 L4 113K2 L4 114J1 L4 117J1 L4 118K2 L4 078K2 L4 079K2 L4 080J1 L4 081K1 L4 082H4 L4 067H4 L4 077H4 L4 105U1 L4 108J1 L4 107K1 L4 063T2 L4 1752.3.3© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualNOTESThis sample location plan illustrates where signs should be installed.

This confirmation is achieved through consistent application of the approved information hierarchy (see NYU Langone Health Wayfinding and Communications Master Plan, Chapter 3: Wayfinding and Communications Strategy).In addition to consistency of message, the application of a unified aesthetic is critical to providing an easily recognizable cue for individuals to confirm their arrival.Each NYU Langone Health facility will require several types of signage at any given entrance. The enterprise identity, building name and address, donor recognition, and directional signage must all co exist at the entrance. While not every sign type will be used at every entrance, it is important to consider the placement of information such that it conforms with a consistent hierarchy across all facilities.All exterior signage is subject to total square footage allowances as determined by city zoning permits and/or variances.Information HierarchyMulti Entrance Facility RequirementsSingle Entrance Facility RequirementsSign TypeDISTANCE VIEW1.
