NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 375 2024 SECURITY Given its location in the heart of New York City, NYU Langone pays special attention to security in its facilities and operations. In order to bring existing and new locations undergoing renovations in line with our security standards, new security components are required to be installed as additions to existing security systems or completely new installations. Security system design and installation will require varied approaches depending on the Project Type as outlined below: 1. Project Types  Facilities with Existing Security Systems In nearly all facilities that NYU Langone owns or leases, there is an existing security system to which follow on installations will link and we will use that vendor’s equipment for the follow on installation. The vendor of that equipment is the Security Vendor. The RED+F PM and the A/E Team will work with the Security Vendor to develop equipment placement requirements and will meet with NYU Langone’s Security Department at key points during the design and construction process for their review of the security design. Among other things, the Security Department will review the equipment the Security Vendor proposes to use and the pricing. The Security Vendor will work under contract to the construction contractor.  Facilities without Existing Security Systems If the facility is new, there will not be an existing Security Vendor. Accordingly, the Architect shall provide security design services or shall engage the services of a Security Consultant (pre approved by NYU Langone’s Security Department) to provide such services and the Architect will be responsible for the services the Security Vendor would otherwise provide. The project team will work with RED+F’s Project Support Office to determine how to procure the Security Vendor. Alternatively, RED+F may direct the use of an existing Security Vendor. 2. Project Development and Design The following are required milestones for meetings with NYU Langone to determine security needs, develop scope and coordinate final recommendations:  Schematic Design During Schematic Design a meeting with the A/E Team, RED+F’s PM, User Group leadership and any additional stakeholder(s) of the new space shall be held. The purpose of the meeting is to review security needs for the project.  Design Development During the Design Development Phase, the Architect shall provide Floor plans, Furniture plans, Reflected Ceiling plans and Door Hardware information to and meet with the Security Department and Security Vendor at the same time. The Architect will propose for Security Department approval a security system design that incorporates User Group requests, Stakeholder requests, NYU Langone security standards and industry security standards.  Construction Documents During the Construction Document Phase, the Architect (through the RED+F PM) will organize a meeting of the A/E Team, Security Department, and RED+F’s PM to review the proposed security solutions and seek Security Department approval thereof. The Security Vendor will provide the A/E Team with equipment cut NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 376 2024 sheets, cabling and rough in requirements. The A/E Team will incorporate this information into the Construction Documents. A final meeting will be held with the A/E Team, Security Department, RED+F’s PM, User Group leadership and any additional stakeholder(s) of the new space to present the final coordinated security design. The decision for systems cabling responsibility will also be determined at this time.  “As Built” Documentation The Architect shall provide the Security Vendor and Security Department with copies of the finalized “As Built” in electronic form acceptable for import into BuildFlow. 3. General Requirements for Security Design The Architect shall follow the security requirements listed below in the design of the project:  Any code issues, such as fire and life safety, that affect security operations must be addressed by the Architect.  Interior Common spaces should not be isolated from entrances or stairs. Consider location of permanent staff in multiple locations within spaces to limit possibility of unoccupied spaces that cannot be monitored. Consider use of interior glazing and other strategies to improve visibility and accessibility. If a security officer post is included in the design, consider sightlines from the seated position.  Security access control and alarm systems on the superblock must be compatible and integrated with the existing system at the NYU Langone Security Operations Center. Systems off the superblock will be evaluated on a case by case basis as to their need to be tied into the existing system or if they can be stand alone and tied into a central station for monitoring and subsequent response.  Cameras are required at all lobbies, laundry rooms, cash handling areas, elevators, stair doors, entrance and egress doors, as well as any other areas as recommended by NYU Langone Health. Final camera locations shall be centered on other ceiling mounted elements (i.e. light fixtures, sprinklers, etc.) and coordinated with NYULH Security, the Security Vendor, MCIT and RED+F Design Studio.  All windows should be lockable.  A/E Team should alert NYU Langone Health to security conditions that are not immediately apparent but would have operational impact, such as emergency egress doors that are on hold opens.  Areas of high security risk generally include where cash, narcotics, or retail operations are planned, as well as areas housing behavioral health (i.e. Psychiatry), Infant/Pediatric, Emergency Department, TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) or ICU patients. These areas require greater access control, panic alarms and camera coverage. In some cases, specialized systems, such as Infant/Patient tracking and monitoring systems need to be incorporated NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 377 2024 into the design to include emergency card reader override buttons and one button lockdown feature as required.  IDF closets require Lenel security systems and IP camera installed within. Access will be controlled by the MCIT Department.  Exterior Lighting design must carefully consider appropriate light levels without compromising security. Employ “passive” security design strategies such as avoiding dead end spaces and blind corners, and areas that are isolated from foot traffic or out of sight. Consider relationship of ground floor spaces to the exterior for sightlines and access to open windows and doors. Where security officer posts are required, consider issues of congestion, sightlines, ADA compliance and the physical comfort (furniture and HVAC) of the personnel. 4. Related Security Design Guidelines  NYPD has published security guidelines entitled Engineering Security, Protective Design for High Risk Buildings. Where applicable these guidelines are to be referenced and utilized as necessary.

END OF BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SUBSECTION NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines CLOSE OUT PACKAGE Real Estate Development and Facilities 565 2024 CLOSE OUT PACKAGE At the end of a project, close out packages are to be completed and submitted to RED+F per the Substantial Completion and Project Closeout Checklists shown below. The goal is to have all projects closed 120 days after the first user has moved in. The A/E Team shall request the latest version of these checklists from the RED+F PM at time of close out. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines CLOSE OUT PACKAGE Real Estate Development and Facilities 566 2024 NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PHOTOGRAPHY Real Estate Development and Facilities 567 2024 PHOTOGRAPHY The RED+F Project Manager shall engage a professional photographer pre approved by the Design Studio to photograph the project after construction is complete and before move in. The cost of this shall be included in the Project Budget. A professional photographer may also be engaged by the Architect to photograph the project. The Architect shall request pre approval from NYU Langone Health of the photographer they wish to use. The RED+F PM and GC/CM shall allocate sufficient time in the schedule to professionally photograph the project. The time shall be clearly shown on the project schedule. The length of time needed will be based on the size and scope of the project. At a minimum two days will be allocated for spaces up to 50,000 GSF. One more day shall be allocated for each additional 50,000 GSF. Final photography must be scheduled as follows:  After construction is complete and no contractors are on the premises  After final cleaning has occurred  Before any move in preparation has begun All the major public spaces and architecturally important components shall be photographed sufficiently to show the scope of the project. Final high resolution files shall be provided to the Design Studio at RED+F via the RED+F PM. Below are a few examples: NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PHOTOGRAPHY Real Estate Development and Facilities 568 2024 NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines POST OCCUPANCY EVALUATIONS Real Estate Development and Facilities 569 2024 POST OCCUPANCY EVALUATIONS RED+F is continually seeking to improve the Design and Construction process of the built environment and has established a Built Environment Improvement Cycle. The cycle, which consists of Design Construction Occupancy Evaluation and back to Design, allows for continual improvement of the built environment by establishing a Post Occupancy Evaluation phase. The Post Occupancy Evaluation phase occurs after the users have moved in and utilized the space for a certain period of time, typically about a year. The intent of the Post Occupancy Evaluation is to provide feedback on the design and general performance of materials and furniture over a period of time. The RED+F Design Studio performs the Post Occupancy Evaluation. It is important the same group perform the evaluation in order to maintain a consistent basis of analysis between projects. Results of Post Occupancy Evaluations are then used to inform Project Teams and update the Design Guidelines. For example, materials and furniture that are not holding up well are removed from the Design Guidelines. Materials and furniture that are not part of the Design Guidelines but were approved for a particular project and have been holding up well are considered for inclusion in the Design Guidelines. This process reduces maintenance costs and streamlines the Design process.
