Executive Summary NYU Langone Hospital is submitting this Administrative Review Certificate of Need application for the expansion of its Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) service to the 7th floor (in addition to its current location on the 9th floor) of the Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital, 430 E 34th St, New York, NY 10016. This expansion increases the capacity of the PICU by adding 12 beds for a total of 46 PICU beds. This expansion of the PICU will be accomplished by converting 12 Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) beds which are not in service to 12 PICU beds. In Calendar Year 2023, the PICU’s occupancy rate was consistently above NYULH’s target. Additionally, NYULH’s inpatient pediatric units, from which pediatric ICU patients are regularly transferred, have shown consistent volume growth. These inpatient pediatric units have recently been over occupied. The proposed expansion is anticipated to increase overall pediatric capacity by . Programmatically, the expansion will enable NYULH to accommodate increased volume of pediatric heart and liver transplant patients in response to the Transplant Institute’s consistent year over year growth. Upon implementation of the project, NYULH will also be able to accommodate elective PICU admissions from its outpatient chronic pulmonary care program, which focuses on sleep studies, ventilator adjustments, and antibacterial therapy. The aforementioned occupancy constraints have limited these services. The project will also enable NYULH to have more beds available for transfers from external hospitals with pediatric patients needing a higher level of care, and will increase NYULH’s ability to accommodate high acuity pediatric critical care services. NYULH has an internal transfer team that is available 24/7 to accept transfers from external hospitals for pediatric patients who need a higher level of care, and partners with other hospitals to provide these transport services to ensure their pediatric patients have expedient access to the life saving care and services the NYULH PICU can provide. Additionally, as a regional resource, children needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), chemotherapy, transplant services, and other high acuity treatments are transferred directly to NYULH’s PICU. During the first and third years of operation, NYULH expects to increase discharges by 481 and 508, respectively, compared to what would be expected with the current number of beds. The project will replace approximately 11,800 square feet of existing outpatient space with new construction to provide a pediatric inpatient unit. The unit will contain (12) inpatient rooms, including (1) ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and (1) AII/PE patient room. Additional spaces within the unit will support patients, visitors, staff, and facilitate patient care. Please note that the architectural components of this application will be reviewed by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY). 7/24/2024 DOH 155 B Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 1 (Revised 11/2018) Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 CON Forms Regarding Environmental issues Contents: Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 Environmental Assessment DOH 155 B Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 2 (Revised 11/2018) Environmental Assessment Part I.

Storm and Flood Mitigation Definitions of FEMA Flood Zone Designations Flood zones are geographic areas that the FEMA has defined according to varying levels of flood risk. These zones are depicted on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Hazard Boundary Map. Each zone reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. Please use the FEMA Flood Designations scale below as a guide to answering all Part IV questions regardless of project location, flood and or evacuation zone. Yes No 4.1 Is the proposed site located in a flood plain? If Yes, indicate classification below and provide the Elevation Certificate (FEMA Flood Insurance). Moderate to Low Risk Area Yes No Zone Description In communities that participate in the NFIP, flood insurance is available to all property owners and renters in these zones: B and X Area of moderate flood hazard, usually the area between the limits of the 100 year and 500 year floods. Are also used to designate base floodplains of lesser hazards, such as areas protected by levees from 100 year flood, or shallow flooding areas with average depths of less than one foot or drainage areas less than 1 square mile. DOH 155 B Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 5 (Revised 11/2018) C and X Area of minimal flood hazard, usually depicted on FIRMs as above the 500 year flood level. High Risk Areas Yes No Zone Description In communities that participate in the NFIP, mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply to all these zones: A Areas with a annual chance of flooding and a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Because detailed analyses are not performed for such areas; no depths or base flood elevations are shown within these zones. AE The base floodplain where base flood elevations are provided. AE Zones are now used on new format FIRMs instead of A1 A30. A1 30 These are known as numbered A Zones (e.g., A7 or A14). This is the base floodplain where the FIRM shows a BFE (old format). AH Areas with a annual chance of shallow flooding, usually in the form of a pond, with an average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Base flood elevations derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected intervals within these zones. AO River or stream flood hazard areas, and areas with a or greater chance of shallow flooding each year, usually in the form of sheet flow, with an average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Average flood depths derived from detailed analyses are shown within these zones. AR Areas with a temporarily increased flood risk due to the building or restoration of a flood control system (such as a levee or a dam). Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements will apply, but rates will not exceed the rates for unnumbered A zones if the structure is built or restored in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations. A99 Areas with a annual chance of flooding that will be protected by a Federal flood control system where construction has reached specified legal requirements. No depths or base flood elevations are shown within these zones. High Risk Coastal Area Yes No Zone Description In communities that participate in the NFIP, mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply to all these zones: Zone V Coastal areas with a or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated with storm waves. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. No base flood elevations are shown within these zones. VE, V1 30 Coastal areas with a or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated with storm waves. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Base flood elevations derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected intervals within these zones. Undetermined Risk Area Yes No Zone Description DOH 155 B Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 6 (Revised 11/2018) D Areas with possible but undetermined flood hazards. No flood hazard analysis has been conducted. Flood insurance rates are commensurate with the uncertainty of the flood risk. 4.2 Are you in a designated evacuation zone? If Yes, the Elevation Certificate (FEMA Flood Insurance) shall be submitted with the application. If yes which zone is the site located in? 4.3 Does this project reflect the post Hurricane Lee, and or Irene, and Superstorm Sandy mitigation standards? If Yes, which floodplain? 100 Year 500 Year The Elevation Certificate provides a way for a community to document compliance with the community’s floodplain management ordinance. http://www.fema.gov/media library data/20130726 1437 20490 3457/f_053_elevationcertificate_jan13.pdf DOH 155 B Schedule 6 cover (9/6/2022) Schedule 6 Architectural/Engineering Submission Contents: o Schedule 6 Architectural/Engineering Submission New York State Department of Health Schedule 6 Certificate of Need Application DOH 155 B Schedule 6 Page 1 (9/6/2022) Architectural Submission Requirements for Contingent Approval and Contingency Satisfaction Schedule applies to all projects with construction, including Articles 28 & 40, i.e., Hospitals, Diagnostic and Treatment Centers, Residential Health Care Facilities, and Hospices.
