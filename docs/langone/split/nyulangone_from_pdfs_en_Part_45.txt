GENERAL A. End of Project Requirements As part of a break out cost, the design engineer shall review the as built documentation provided by the subcontractors and edit the project design documents to reflect the “as built” condition. The engineer shall confirm the collaborated as builts are correct and complete. To create these collaborated as builts the design engineers shall use the contractor as builts as a reference, which shall be provided to the engineer in PDF form and native (AutoCAD or Revit). I. Single Line Diagrams Steam Distribution CHW Distribution CW Distribution Domestic Water Distribution Sanitary and Storm Drainage Distribution Medical Gas Distribution Medical Vacuum Distribution Electrical Distribution (Normal and Emergency) Controls System II.

NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines GENERAL Real Estate Development and Facilities 359 2023 B. Training Training for new equipment or controls shall be written into design specifications. There shall be two training sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon to pick up all worker shifts. Training syllabus shall be provided to design engineer as well as NYU Langone Health RED+F Facilities Operations for review prior to training sessions for review and comment. Training must be done by qualified personnel with intricate knowledge of equipment and system and not by salesman. C. Mercury Elimination Program Compliance In an effort to protect patients, staff, researchers and the environment, it is the policy of NYU Langone Health to prohibit the use of mercury containing equipment, materials and instrumentation where safe, effective alternatives exist. This program is outline in more detail in NYU Langone Health Safety Policy No. 170. Typical mercury containing materials could include—thermostats, switches, float controls and lamps. Approved suppliers with known mercury free alternatives are identified herein, but this list should not be assumed to be complete. If a designer or engineer believes the use of mercury containing materials (besides UV, florescent and LED light bulbs, ballasts and mercury containing batteries, which are exempted) is mandatory, the need must be formally presented to the NYU Langone Health RED+F Facilities Operations Department to obtain express permission for its use prior to any deviation from this guideline. I. If permission for use of mercury containing materials (besides UV, florescent and LED light bulbs, ballasts and mercury containing batteries) is given by RED+F Facilities Operations then engineers, designers or installers must ensure the proper inventorying, reporting and safe handling of any mercury containing materials and equipment. These requirements include: a. Labeling of Material Proper “mercury containing material” stick on labels can be obtained from Facilities Operations (Greenberg Hall, SC2, Rm 122) b. Inventorying of Material An inventory log of properly labeled materials/equipment with installation date and specific location must be submitted to Facilities Operations by the end of project as part of closeout documentation. c. Complying with all safe handling and disposal guidelines outlined by NYU Langone Health Environmental Health & Safety in its policies available on its website and referenced in contracts. D. Equipment Manufacturers U.S. made is strongly preferred. Non US manufacturers will be considered. Example: Ventrol, Mammoth, Alliance Air, etc. E. Equipment Access All equipment shall be installed with manufacturer’s recommended clearance or code required clearance for maintenance and repair. F. State, Federal & Utility Incentives Financial rebates and incentives may be available for select mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and energy management projects.

Rebates and incentives may be offered by, but not limited to, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Long Island Power Authority, and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). G. Local Law 97 Compliance & Planning Projects within New York City must complete a life cycle cost review of Local Law 97 compliance and potential penalties based on project design. Any scenario planning around energy infrastructure must take into account amortized life cycle cost of future penalties using a moderate approach to carbon coefficients after 2034. This includes installations and upgrades to mechanical equipment that impact building energy use type and consumption, such as but not limited to: boilers, generators, chillers, and heat pumps. H. Engineering Dos and Don’ts 1. If an item is not included in the guidelines, follow up with facilities. 2. Confirm with RED+F PM team that Commissioning has been bought out to a third party to include specs in engineering subsections. This is a code requirement for Article 28 spaces. In addition, commissioning is a DOB requirement for non Article 28, please reference the NYC Energy Code for specifics. 3. Design engineer to confirm with RED+F PM that a page turn has been setup with facilities at different stages of design (schematic, design development, contract drawings). 4. Design Engineer or Architect to carry meeting minutes during page turn with facilities and submit to facilities after meeting. 5. If designing an Article 28 space, provide drawing notes for all trades to prevent any object from touching, laying or hanging from sprinkler piping. 6. Ensure BMS sequence operations lines up with control sensors indicated on one line drawings. 7. Do not have all similar equipment on the same electrical panel. Distribute the electrical loads. (i.e. like pumps, AHUs, etc.) 8. If designing HVAC for sterilizers, heat load calculation shall be run for skin loss as well as cooling of cleaned items right after a sterilization cycle.

Engineer to include on the "E" drawings. PM to confirm with the GC/CM. 24. Do not locate IT room HVAC equipment in ceilings of the rooms. Locate outside the rooms and duct in. Or use a split system and hang the evaporator on the wall and drain outside the room. 25. Use only concealed sprinkler heads, not recessed. 26. Specify tamperproof receptacles in all waiting rooms, regardless of the clinical function of the practice. 27. For laboratory equipment rooms, provide exhaust registers directly above heat generating equipment. 28. Include UL approved pass thru sleeves for future use in all smoke/fire partitions to prevent non firestopped penetrations resulting from future cable pulls. 29. Thought must be given to redundancy for critical MEP systems. If a system loss will result in compromised patient safety or revenue loss to the institution, redundant systems need to be included in the design (i.e. emergency power, UPS, etc.) 30. DO NOT USE USG Sheetrock Acoustical Sealant at medical gas copper pipe penetrations. It corrodes the pipes. Use an alternate. 31.
