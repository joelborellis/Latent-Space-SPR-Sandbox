each of the parties responsible for approval. When all signatures on the form are received the project account is established and the design process begins. 2. Design Phase Once approved, a NYU Langone project manager (RED+F PM) is assigned to the project and a project user group is established. Before the start of design, RED+F engages the services of an Architectural and Engineering Team (A/E Team) through a qualification based selection process where the RED+F PM communicates the project’s objective, scope, budget, and schedule. Once the A/E Team is selected the design phase begins. Starting with a design kick off meeting, the PM coordinates a series of meetings with the Users and the Project Team to gather information. This group comprising representatives from users, the Design Studio, Facilities Management, MCIT, Senior Administration, architectural and engineering consultantsA/E Team, and the construction manager, if applicable will guide the project through planning and design. Its meetings provide a forum for coordination of the various aspects of the project during the design process.  Schematic Design (SD) This first phase of the design process defines the design parameters and the overall layout. The A/E Team generates schemes based on information gathered from a field investigation (documenting existing conditions) as well as from Users. The PM brings in other NYULH departments (i.e. Design Studio, Facilities, MCIT, Infection Prevention and Control, EH&S, Security, Energy & Sustainability, etc.) to help inform the design from their perspectives. Schemes are reviewed by all stakeholders and refined accordingly. An estimate will be prepared at the end of this preliminary design phase to verify that the project remains within budget. The budget must be reconciled with scope prior to proceeding with the next phase of design. A/E Deliverables: Meeting Minutes (incl photographs of the approved finish samples taken during or immediately after a meeting and labeled accordingly) Schedule NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 24 2024 Cost Estimate Outline BIM Execution Plan (if applicable) Feasibility Studies Outline Program Analysis (including file/storage analysis) Outline Scope Narrative (incl. user requirements such as storage needs, etc.) Outline “Basis of Design” document For LEED Projects (Refer to the Environmental Sustainability subsection): Preliminary Integrative Design Process documentation Outline “Owner’s Project Requirements” document SD Drawings: Demolition Plans Floor Plans (w/ FFE, material notes, etc.) Elevations CAD Renderings of major spaces MEP/FP schematic drawings (single line acceptable) Structural schematic drawings (i.e. primary structural system) Sample materials Outline Equipment List Outline architectural and engineering specifications  Design Development (DD) In this phase, the layout agreed upon in preliminary design is developed in greater detail with all major components of the project defined and developed. There is often heavy User involvement to be sure that the design adheres to their needs. The PM brings in other NYU Langone Health departments (i.e. Design Studio, Facilities, MCIT, Infection Prevention and Control, EH&S, Security, Energy & Sustainability, etc.) to help inform the design from their perspectives. All key design decisions are made and agreed upon by the end of this phase. The PM works with the A/E Team to keep scope in line with what was initially approved, with the addition of any changes incorporated during preliminary design. The PM must approve any changes to the agreed upon and authorized scope of the project as such changes would have impacts on the project budget. An estimate is prepared at the end of the Design Development phase and the budget must be reconciled with the project scope prior to proceeding with the next phase. In addition, the User must sign off on the floor plan(s) in a timely manner in order for the A/E Team to proceed into the Construction Document phase and maintain the overall project schedule. A/E Deliverables: Meeting Minutes (incl photographs of the approved finish samples taken during or immediately after a meeting and labeled accordingly) Schedule Cost Estimate Updated BIM Execution Plan (if applicable) Final Program Analysis Final Scope Narrative (incl. user requirements such as storage needs, etc.) NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 25 2024 Updated “Basis of Design” document For LEED Projects (Refer to the Environmental Sustainability subsection): Updated Integrative Design Process documentation Updated “Owner’s Project Requirements” document DD Drawings: Floor Plans (w/ FFE, dimensions, partition tags, RED+F room numbers, etc.) Enlarged Floor Plans (of typical and major spaces) Reflected Ceiling Plans Elevations Sections Schedules (i.e. Room Finish, Furniture, Door, Door Hardware, Lighting, Plumbing Fixture, Toilet Accessory, Building Accessory, Pantry Appliance, etc.) Typical and Major Details (i.e. building envelope, lobby / reception, millwork, etc.) CAD Renderings of major spaces MEP/FP DD drawings (including double line HVAC drawings and riser diagrams) Structural DD drawings (including typical details) Furniture package including (Refer to the Design Studio Review Process subsection): Finalized Furniture plans Finalized Furniture specifications Signage and Wayfinding package including a list of all applicable codes, list of assumptions and observations, location plans (including locations of brand/donor related signage), message schedule (including room and wayfinding signage, recycling posters and decals, code required emergency/egress signage, health/safety signage, etc.) and simple elevation renderings for “high profile” sign types. “High profile” sign types shall include brand/donor related signage such as: Building ID Branding/Recognition Canopy Signage/Recognition Building Entry Signage/Recognition Main Lobby Recognition Floor Recognition Departmental Recognition Waiting Area Recognition Staging/phasing plans (if applicable) Updated sample materials Finish and Furniture Booklets Updated Equipment List Updated architectural and engineering specifications Outline List of Special Inspections or Testing required by the Building Code  Construction Documents (CD) This phase takes the design as developed and finalized during Design Development and documents it for construction. Details are further refined as construction issues are addressed. The main emphasis of this phase is to verify that all needed information is on the drawings and in the specifications so that the project can be bid for construction. Typically, there are fewer meetings in this phase that require the involvement of the Users, as the emphasis is documentation of earlier design decisions. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 26 2024 Again, previously agreed upon and authorized scope, schedule and budget must be adhered to, and the Project Manager works with the A/E Team to keep scope in line, taking into account any changes incorporated during previous phases. At the end of this phase the Project Manager puts the project out to bid.

Construction Phase After the Design phase the Project Manager coordinates construction of the project according to the construction drawings and specifications set by the Contract Documents. Project Managers have expertise in architecture, engineering, design and construction to bring capital construction and renovation projects forward from design to completion and occupancy.  Bidding and Negotiation (B/N) As a given project moves from development to the construction phase, the Project Manager initiates and oversees the bidding and negotiation procedure, forwarding contract documents to a list of pre qualified contractors to solicit bids. During the ensuing bid period, the Project Manager and a consulting team (typically an architect and engineer) answer questions raised by bidders, making sure all bidders are aware of all questions asked and answered. At the end of bidding, contractors submit their proposed prices in sealed bids. Once the bids are opened, a leveling process ensues ̶ a critical part of the process; leveling vets out discrepancies among bids to ensure an “apples to apples” comparison. A/E Deliverables: Meeting Minutes Participation in Pre Bid Conferences and Site Walkthroughs Bid Documents (Instructions to Bidders, Bid Form, Drawings and Specifications) Written RFI Responses Review and Approval of product substitution(s), “or equal” product(s) Bid Leveling and Evaluation Assist with bid negotiations and bidder selection Final Construction Documents (including supplemental Addendums issued prior to award of construction contract)  Construction Administration (CA) Once leveling is completed, the project is awarded to the qualified bidder with the lowest bid, and a contract sets an agreed upon price for the work and commits the winning contractor to the authorized scope, schedule and budget. Starting with a construction kick off meeting and continuing through the life of the project, the Project Manager sets goals and continually reviews the progress of construction with a focus on maintaining schedule and budget. During construction, the Project Manager also orchestrates the coordination required with all other team members and organizations with ancillary project responsibilities, such as the Design Studio, Facilities, IT, Environmental Health & Safety, Radiation Safety, Infection Prevention and Control, Life Safety, Clinical Engineering and Security; as well as interior designers and other specialty consultants. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 28 2024 During this phase the A/E Team is responsible for helping the Contractor build the project as specified in the NYU Langone approved Construction Documents.
