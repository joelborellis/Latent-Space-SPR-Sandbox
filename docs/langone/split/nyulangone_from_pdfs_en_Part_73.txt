NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines MATERIAL LEGEND Real Estate Development and Facilities 160 2024 MATERIAL LEGEND In accordance with both our Mission devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research and our Design Principles of providing timeless designs that are cost effective, efficient, functional and practical, RED+F has developed a palette of typical materials and finishes that we have found to be successful for various spaces at NYU Langone Health. Our goals in listing these materials and finishes are to:  Streamline the design process  Assist the Architect and Interior Designer with specifying materials  Comply with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all materials and finishes  Meet NYU Langone’s sustainability goals  Create spaces that are timeless, durable, easily maintainable and cost effective  Create a consistent NYU Langone brand The Architect and Interior Designer should use this as a guide for specifying the finishes on NYU Langone capital projects. This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of specifying materials that are appropriate and code compliant for specific spaces. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider specifying existing building specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Also, the Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other materials and finishes if they believe those proposed materials and finishes will support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project. Products that require oversees delivery should be stocked in the United States. Recommended manufacturers and products for specific applications have been provided in the following categories: A.
