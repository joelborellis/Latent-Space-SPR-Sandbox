Cannabidiol for Postoperative Pain Control after Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair Demonstrates No Functional Deficits: 1 Year Follow up of a Randomized Controlled TrialMichael J. Alaia1, Zachary I.

Jazrawi: Arthrex, Mitek, Smith & Nephew, and Wolters Kluwer Health•Guillem Gonzalez Lomas: Arthrex2Background• Cannabidiol (CBD) has recently demonstrated a positive impact on patient pain and satisfaction immediately after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR)• Despite increasing popularity of non prescription CBD for pain treatment, there are limited high quality studies investigating therapeutic effects and safety long term• Does the addition of CBD to a postoperative regimen cause any changes in clinical outcomes?3PurposeTo evaluate 1 year functional outcomes among patients who previously underwent ARCR and received buccally absorbed cannabidiol or an identical placebo in early post operative pain management.4HypothesisThere will be no significant differences in pain or shoulder function between those who received CBD vs placebo at 1 year follow up.Methods• Inclusion: All opioid naive patients ages 18 75 years undergoing ARCR who previously completed an FDA sanctioned, multi center, placebo controlled, randomized, double blinded trial evaluating the analgesic effects of CBD in immediate postoperative period• Exclusion: Marijuana users, preop opiates, abnormal coag history/VTE, stroke/ACS history 3 months preop, renal/liver failure, on medications with significant interaction with CYP pathway• Randomization Experimental group: 25 mg CBD TID if <80kg and 50 mg of CBD TID if >80kg for 14 days Control group: Identical placebo5Methods Outcomes• Patient reported outcomes at minimum 1 year follow up Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score Satisfaction (VAS)• Statistical analyses Mann Whitney U test Fischer’s exact test One way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc testing (25 mg, 50 mg, placebo)67Methods CONSORT Flow Diagram VARIABLECBDPLACEBOPAge at surgery (years)58.4 ± 9.557.5 ± 10.60.591Sex (female)15 (35.7)14 (35.0)0.946Body mass index28.9 ± 4.828.1 ± 7.60.659Biceps tenodesis7 (16.7)11 (27.5)0.236Subacromial decompression19 (45.2)11 (27.5)0.096Both biceps tenodesis and subacromial decompression10 (23.8)16 (40.0)0.115No. of anchors used3.3 ± 1.63.2 ± 1.40.6608Results Demographics and Operative CharacteristicsVariableCBD (n=42)Placebo (n=40)pVAS Pain0.8 ± 1.61.2 ± 1.80.384ASES93.0 ± 13.991.1 ± 15.00.714Activities of daily living, subscore45.7 ± 7.446.2 ± 5.70.764Achieved PASS34 (81.0)31 (77.5)0.788SANE87.6 ± 12.290.1 ± 13.10.236Satisfaction97.4 ± 5.295.4 ± 9.90.408Surgery met expectations (Y/N)42 (100)39 (97.5)0.488Would be willing to repeat (Y/N)40 (95.2)39 (97.5)0.6169Results Patient Reported Outcomes**Secondary procedures: Three patients, one in the CBD group (2.) and two in the placebo group (5.), underwent arthroscopic revision following the index ARCR (p = 0.611)10Results Subgroup Analysis by DoseVariableCBD 25 mg(n=16)CBD 50 mg(n=26)Placebo(n=40)pVAS Pain0.7 ± 1.40.9 ± 1.81.2 ± 1.80.632ASES93.4 ± 11.292.1 ± 15.891.1 ± 15.00.747Activities of daily living, subscore46.6 ± 5.345.2 ± 8.646.2 ± 5.70.753Achieved PASS13 (83.3)21 (80.8)31 (77.5)0.928SANE87.3 ± 13.187.8 ± 11.990.1 ± 13.10.664Satisfaction97.6 ± 4.497.2 ± 5.795.4 ± 9.90.578Surgery met expectations (Y/N)16 (100)26 (100)39 (97.5)0.603Would be willing to repeat (Y/N)16 (100)24 (92.3)39 (97.5)0.150*Patients <80 kg received 25 mg TID and those >80 kg received the 50 mg dose.Limitations• Patients were no longer blinded regarding which treatment group they were assigned in original study by the time of latest follow up They were not reminded of their allocation during follow up unless specifically requested• Patient reported outcome scores were not collected preoperatively, so it was not possible to calculate the pre to postoperative improvement Original trial randomization would have accounted for differences in baseline function, and the current study was adequately powered to determine differences in clinical outcomes at 1 year follow up• Multiple orthopedic surgeons However surgical technique was largely similar, and the postoperative protocol was uniform across patients in the study11Conclusion• Peri operative use of CBD for pain control among patients undergoing ARCR does not result in any significant differences in patient reported pain, satisfaction, or functional outcomes at least 1 year postoperatively compared to a placebo control• CBD can be considered in a postoperative multimodal pain management regimen without detrimental effects on outcome. 12References1.
