Within 2 Months of TJA Increases the Risk for Periprosthetic Joint Infection Enrico M. Forlenza, MD, E. Bailey Terhune, MD, Jeffrey A. Geller, MD, Craig J. Della Valle, MD2022 AAHKS Annual Meeting | Final Program76Introduction: Fungal prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are thought to affect of all total knee (TKA) and total hip (THA) PJIs. Recommendations against obtaining routine fungal cultures in the setting of PJI has been recently proposed. However, the goal of this study is to demonstrate the possibility that fungal PJIs may have been previously underreported. Methods: This is a retrospective case control study of all PJIs, defined by the Musculoskeletal Infection Society, treated at a single institution between January 1, 2017, until June 20, 2021. A fungal PJI had isolated a fungal pathogen from synovial fluid or tissue culture during treatment, and the remaining PJIs were placed in a control group for comparison. Patient demographics, laboratory results and outcomes were analyzed. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi squared or Fisher's exact tests and continuous variables with student's t tests or Mann Whitney U tests where appropriate. Results: A total of 296 PJIs were identified with 47 of them defined as fungal PJIs (15.). Patient demographics did not differ between the two groups (p> 0.05). The number of TKA and THA PJIs between the two groups were similar (p>0.05). Candida sp was the most common fungal species isolated (n=40, 85.). Most (80.) fungal PJIs also isolated a bacterial pathogen in synovial or tissue cultures during their treatment. Compared with controls, there was a significant difference in the presence of corynebacterium striatum (p=0.003), vancomycin resistant enterococcus sp (p=0.007), and enterobacter sp. (p=0.005) in fungal PJIs. PJI treatment success was significantly different between the cases and controls (19.1 vs 61., p< 0.001). Case fatality rate was higher amongst fungal PJIs (25.5 vs 14.) but this difference was not significant (p=0.069). Conclusion: Fungal PJIs may have been previously underreported in the literature, which would challenge recent recommendations to discontinue routine fungal cultures during PJI treatment.NotesPaper #51Fungal Prosthetic Joint Infections: An Emerging Pathogen? Kathryn L. Fideler, MD, MPH, Eric M. Kiskaddon, MD, Matthew T. Pigott, MD, Kenan Alzouhayli, BA, Andrew Phillips, BA, Douglas Chonko, DO www.AAHKS.org/Meeting77Introduction: The optimum indications for performing debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are unclear. This study aimed to identify the success rate of DAIR in a large multicenter cohort and compare the success rates of DAIR between different PJI classification systems. Methods: Prospective data from the Prosthetic joint Infection in Australia and New Zealand Observational (PIANO) study was analyzed. This study included first time PJIs occurring after primary TKA that were managed with DAIR between July 2014 and December 2017. Treatment success was defined as the patient being alive with absence of clinical or microbiological reinfection and no ongoing use of antibiotics at 2 year follow up. The rate of DAIR success was compared against the Coventry (early PJI = ≤1 month), International Consensus Meeting (ICM, early PJI = ≤90 days), Auckland (early PJI = <1 year) and Tsukayama PJI classification systems. Multivariate binary logistic regression models were produced for each classification system with adjustment for patient and microbiological factors. Results: 189 PJI cases were managed with DAIR with an overall success rate of (85/189). DAIR success was highest in early PJIs defined according to the Coventry system (adjusted OR=3.85, p=0.008), the ICM system (adjusted OR=3.08, p=0.005) and the Auckland system (adjusted OR=2.60, p=0.01). DAIR success was lower in both hematogenous (adjusted OR=0.36, p=0.034) and chronic infections (adjusted OR=0.14, p=0.003) when defined according to the Tsukayama system. Conclusion: DAIR success is highest in infections occurring within one year of the primary TKA. Late infections had a high failure rate of DAIR irrespective of their classification as hematogenous or chronic. Time since primary can predict DAIR success.NotesPaper #52Success of Debridement, Antibiotics and Implant Retention in Prosthetic Joint Infection Richard Rahardja, MD, Mark Zhu, MD, Joshua Davis, MD, PhD, Laurens Manning, MD, PhD, Sarah Metcalf, MD, Simon W. Young, FRACS 2022 AAHKS Annual Meeting | Final Program78Introduction: Management of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) often requires multiple surgeries with prolonged antibiotic courses resulting in decreased quality of life and increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Such stressors adversely affect mental health and are overlooked in PJI treatment. Despite the known effects of mental health on outcomes, the role PJI treatment plays in the development and relapse of mood disorders remains largely unreported. This study reports on the incidence of depression and anxiety following antibiotic spacer placement for PJI.Methods: Patients who underwent antibiotic spacer for PJI following total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were identified through national insurance databases (PearlDiver) using Current Process Terminology (CPT) codes for antibiotic hip and knee spacer and International Classification of Diseases codes specific for PJI. Patients with aseptic revision THA and TKA were similarly identified. Incidence of initial and recurrent depression and anxiety were identified within 1 year following antibiotic spacer among PJI and aseptic revision THA and TKA cohorts, respectively. Descriptive and univariate analysis were subsequently conducted. Results: 108,858 patients were included; 58,899 revision TKA (rTKA), 11,167 rTKA secondary to PJI, 34,884 revision THA (rTHA), 3,908 rTHA secondary to PJI. Relative to aseptic rTKA, patients receiving antibiotic spacer placement for treatment of PJI have higher incidence of new depression (OR 3.67; p< 0.01), anxiety (OR 5.12; p< 0.01), and anxiety and depression combined (OR 3.60; p< 0.01). Relative to aseptic rTHA, Patients receiving antibiotic spacer placement for treatment of PJI have higher incidence of new depression (OR 4.54; p< 0.01), anxiety (OR 6.00; p< 0.01), and anxiety and depression combined (OR 4.85; p< 0.01). Conclusion: There is high incidence of depression and anxiety among patients following the first stage of a two stage revision THA or TKA for PJI and collaborative care with mental health professionals should be considered.NotesPaper #53High Incidence of Mood Disorders After Antibiotic Spacer Placement for PJI Following THA and TKAAvilash Das, MD, Alex Gu, MD, Amil R.

Golladay, MD www.AAHKS.org/Meeting79Introduction: The most common organisms causing surgical site infection (SSI) arise from skin and mucosal surfaces. Decolonization of the skin prior to a surgical procedure has been shown to be effective in reduction of SSI. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the organism profile of the skin and evaluate the effect of application of a unique antiseptic solution on the skin microbiome.Methods: A total of 50 volunteers were recruited into this study. After randomization one arm of these individuals was cleaned with a wipe that had benzalkonium (BZK) antiseptic solution and the contralateral arm was wiped with PBS. Swab samples of each arm were taken at baseline (prior to application of the agents) and at 3 different timepoints after application (5 min, 2h, and 24h). Skin was protected between 5 min and 2h after application with a sterile wrap. Skin swabs were analyzed for NGS sequencing and culture.Results: The baseline skin bioburden varied greatly among individuals (24 to 32,832 CFU/ml); however, baseline bioburden did not differ between arms (p=0.61). A higher effect of bioburden reduction was observed at 5 min after application of BZK, compared to PBS (median 95. vs. 36., p< 0.01). At the 2h after application of BZK, there was still a bacterial reduction of 96. (IQR 88. 98.) and the PBS arm showed a lower reduction (median 31. [IQR 56.], p< 0.01). By 24h, the reduction in bacterial load was also higher in the BZK arm (median 53. vs. , p< 0.01).Conclusion: There is a wide difference in the skin microbiome of individuals. Application of BZK based antiseptic solution led to elimination of the skin flora for up to 2h after application. The novel antiseptic solution tested during this study has a broad activity against all organisms including fungi and spores.NotesPaper #54Skin Microbiome and Effect of Decolonization Diana Fernandez Rodriguez, MD, JeongEun Cho, BA, Emanuele Chisari, MD, Javad Parvizi, MD, FRCS 2022 AAHKS Annual Meeting | Final Program80Introduction: Biofilm formation is a major clinical challenge contributing to treatment failure of Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Lytic bacteriophages (phages) can target biofilm associated bacteria at localized sites of infection. The aim of this study is to test if phage has a better antimicrobial effect than vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus biofilm aggregates formed in synovial fluid. Methods: S .aureus BP043, a PJI clinical isolate, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and biofilm former was utilized in this study. Phage Remus, known to infect S. aureus, was used. BP043 was grown in human synovial fluid in 96 well for 24hrs as aggregates. Then, these S. aureus biofilm aggregates were treated with: A) phage Remus at ~109 PFU/mL, B) vancomycin, 500 ug/mL, or C) phage Remus, followed by vancomycin. Then, the bacterial aggregates were vortexed vigorously and bacterial survival was assessed by plating on tryptic soy agar plates. Aggregates formation in synovial fluid was assessed using flow cytometer by measuring their size and comparing it to S. aureus clumping in Tryptic Soy broth (TSB). The aggregates were also examined by scan electron microscopy (SEM). Each experiment had two technical repetitions and at least two different human synovial fluids were used. Results: SEM images and flow cytometer data demonstrated the ability of human synovial fluid to promote S. aureus aggregates formation. Phage Remus resulted in more than reduction in viable S. aureus residing in the synovial fluid aggregates, compared to the aggregates with no treatment (p=0.015). Remus is more powerful in breaking down BP043 aggregates and eliminating viable bacteria compared to vancomycin (p=0.02). Moreover, combining phage Remus followed by vancomycin is more efficacious in reducing bacterial load than using Remus or vancomycin alone (p=0.023, p< 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: We demonstrated synergistic interaction between phage Remus and vancomycin, leading to better clearance of MRSA synovial fluid aggregates.NotesPaper #55Combining Bacteriophage and Vancomycin is Efficacious Against MRSA Biofilm Formed in Synovial Fluid Mariam Taha, PhD, Hesham Abdelbary, MD, FRCSCwww.AAHKS.org/Meeting81Introduction: Bacterial surgical site infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and lead to additional medical and surgical treatments, increased costs, and worse outcomes for orthopaedic patients. Bacteria forming extracellular biofilms are particularly resistant to antibiotic and surgical treatments when surgical implants are present. We compared the ability of staphylococcus aureus to form biofilms on common surgical implant materials. Methods: Test coupons composed of hand polished stainless steel (HPSS), titanium (Ti), titanium alloy Ti6Al4V (TiAlV), cobalt chrome alloy Co28Cr6Mo F1537 (CoCr), hydroxyapatite (HA), ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone were coated with biofilms and quantified by CFU count, confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. Surface roughness and water contact angles were assessed with optical profilometer and optical zoom imaging. Results: After 72 hours, biofilms grew more readily on non polished 3D printed metals and plastics, such as TiAlV (4.77e7 CFU) and UHMWPE (5.12e7 CFU) compared to polished and machined metals such as HPSS (1.06e7 CFU), Ti (1.25e7 CFU), and CoCr (2.16e7 CFU), ANOVA p< 0.0001. The materials with greater roughness and hydrophobicity developed more biofilm than smoother, hydrophilic materials.Conclusion: Implant materials and characteristics have a strong correlation with biofilm formation, with hand polishing of metals predicting resistance to biofilm formation. In addition to being mechanically weak and a poor antibiotic release profile, PMMA is also rougher and more hydrophobic than the metal implants, and thus provides an additional surface for bacteria to readily form biofilm. These results may inform implant designs and surgeons may choose materials with reduced biofilm affinity in both septic and aseptic procedures.NotesPaper #56Implant Materials Affect Biofilm FormationDavid Kerr, MD, Megan Zheng, BS, Isabel P.
