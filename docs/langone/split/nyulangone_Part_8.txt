they were performed at another institution. You also need your identification card, insurance card, scan prescription, labs, and related forms. During a Nuclear Medicine Scan When you arrive for your appointment, you need to change into a gown if you are wearing any clothing with metal in it. Please advise the technologist if there is a chance that you may be pregnant. After you change, a technologist escorts you to the injection room or procedure room depending on the exam being performed. The technologist interviews you to take a detailed medical history before administering a radiopharmaceutical. The exam type determines if images are taken shortly after, several hours later, or the next day. The scan length depends on the type of exam. During the scan, you are visible to and can communicate with the technologist, who is present in the room at all times. After a Nuclear Medicine Scan At the end of the scan, the nuclear medicine physician on duty reviews your images. The results of the scan are interpreted by our nuclear medicine physicians and sent immediately to your referring physician, who contacts you with the results. Nuclear Cardiology Stress Testing A specialized type of nuclear imaging is nuclear cardiology stress testing. Experts at NYU Langone’s nuclear cardiology stress testing laboratory perform a range of tests that help cardiologists diagnose and assess many forms of heart disease. Testing is performed daily under the supervision of a board-certified cardiologist, and studies are interpreted by cardiologists and radiologists with advanced training in nuclear cardiology and cardiac imaging. Patients are referred to our laboratory for a variety of reasons. Many patients with cardiac risk factors, such as smoking, high cholesterol, family history of heart disease, , are referred to our experts to be evaluated for the likelihood of In addition, patients with chest pain or other high-risk symptoms are referred to us to find out whether heart disease is the cause of these symptoms. Patients with a known history of heart disease are often sent to us for an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of their medications. Finally, nuclear imaging of the heart is also used to provide information on the strength of the heart muscle. Stress testing most commonly involves exercise on the treadmill. For patients who are unable to exercise, pharmacologic substitutes can be used, including dipyridamole, adenosine, regadenoson, and dobutamine.

MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses, and a computer to produce detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and other internal structures of the body. X-rays are not used as part of this technology. Images can be displayed and examined on a computer monitor, transmitted electronically, printed, or copied to a CD. Radiologists at NYU Langone review and interpret your MRI results to diagnose a variety of different diseases, including abdominal, cardiac, musculoskeletal, neurological, and spine-related conditions. NYU Langone MRI scanners have short bore technology, which makes for a more comfortable scanning experience. Short bore means that the length of the tube you're in during the scan is shorter than usual. Your head and neck may be outside the tube, unless that is the area you are having scanned. If you are claustrophobic, please discuss this with your doctor prior to your MRI appointment. If sedation is prescribed by your doctor, notify the front desk when you arrive that you are taking prescribed medication for your exam. Why Doctors Order an MRI Scan NYU Langone doctors use detailed MRI images to better evaluate various parts of the body in order to determine the presence of certain diseases that may not be adequately assessed with other imaging methods, such as ultrasound However, MRI takes longer than a CT scan, and may not be ideal for all parts of the body. For example, air-filled structures, such as the lungs, are not well evaluated with MRI and may be better evaluated using CT. Depending on what information your doctor needs, the MRI scan may require the use of a contrast agent given through a vein to assist doctors in seeing certain anatomical structures within your body. For Those with Implanted Devices Because MRI technology involves the use of a magnetic field, our schedulers need to ask if you have any metal implanted devices, as well as the make and model of those devices. The reason for these questions is that certain implants may prevent you from having your exam for safety reasons. Asking as much information up front helps us make your experience at the time of the scan as efficient and as fast as possible. Examples of problematic implants include: cardiac pacemakers or old pacemaker wires brain aneurysm clips middle ear prostheses neurostimulators Please tell the intake personnel and your technologist if you have a prosthetic device, such as a hip or knee replacement. In most cases, the presence of this type of replacement does not exclude you from having an imaging exam performed. This information is helpful, though, in terms of modifying the type of MRI study performed. Patients should not wear any eye makeup or hairspray. Believe it or not, they contain metal and can cause problems in a MRI scanner. What to Bring to Your MRI Scan Please bring any previous imaging study results, such as reports, films, or CD-ROMs, from tests that may include X-rays, MRI scans, and CT scans, if they are available. On the day of your exam, bring your prescription, insurance card, and any related insurance forms or pre-approvals. We are able to play a variety of music during your MRI—if you have a preference, simply bring a CD or iPod. Preparing for an MRI Scan Preparation for your MRI depends on the type of exam you are having. If you are having a cholangiogram, or a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, you need to fast for four hours prior to your exam. If you are having an MR-enterography exam, you are required to drink oral contrast. If your doctor has ordered an MRI with contrast using gadolinium, and you have a history of diabetes, kidney problems, or high blood pressure, you must have your creatinine level checked prior to your MRI. The blood test must be taken within six weeks of your exam. If you have had or will be having a liver transplant, the bloodwork must be performed within one week of the exam. During the MRI Scan When you schedule your appointment, our scheduling associate lets you know how early to arrive. Depending on the exam, it may be 30 to 60 minutes before your appointment. This allows you enough time to register and complete all necessary paperwork, forms, or questionnaires. Please indicate any possibility of pregnancy to your physician and the scheduling office when you book the appointment. When you arrive, inform the MRI technologist as well. Gowns are provided for your exam. We have private dressing rooms with lockers for your clothes and valuables, although we recommend that you leave your valuables at home. Please remove all body piercings, jewelry, watches, eyeglasses, hairpins, wallets, and other metallic objects prior to your exam. After you have removed all metal objects, our MRI technologist positions you on the table of the scanner. Your head is placed in a padded plastic cradle or on a pillow, and the table slides into the scanner. An intercom system allows you and the technologist to communicate with each other at all times. In order to obtain clear pictures, you are asked to hold very still and to relax. You may be asked to hold your breath for up to 20 seconds. Any movement during the scan, especially of your head or back—even moving your jaw to talk—can blur and degrade the pictures. The machine makes rapid, loud thumping noises as it takes images. During this time, you should breathe quietly and normally and refrain from moving, coughing, or wiggling. There are multiple series of image acquisitions, each with its own particular noises. When the thumping noise stops, you must be still and maintain your position in the scanner. The entire exam typically takes between 30 and 60 minutes depending on exam type. After an MRI Scan After your procedure, you are escorted back to the dressing room. You are typically able to leave and resume your regular diet and activities. Occasionally, a procedure requires that you stay to be monitored afterward. If you brought prior images for comparison, you can pick them up at the front desk when you leave. Our specialized radiologists read the MRI images and dictate a report that is sent immediately to your referring physician, who contacts you with the results.

To make an appointment, call If you and your doctor decide that spinal surgery is the best treatment for your spine condition, the renowned orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons at the work together to create a personalized treatment plan for you. Whenever appropriate, we use minimally invasive approaches, many of which NYU Langone experts helped pioneer. These techniques allow for smaller incisions, a shorter recovery time, and a quicker return to the activities you enjoy. We use the most advanced navigation and surgical technologies available. For example, our surgeons use Precision Virtual Reality for procedures treating spinal deformities. Developed and refined by NYU Langone neuroradiologists, this technology turns MRI images into three-dimensional virtual reality landscapes, allowing surgeons to view a patient’s anatomy from any angle to improve the accuracy of the procedure. Dr. Anthony Frempong-Boadu performs surgery using advanced, real-time spinal navigation. Our intraoperative monitoring team helps ensure your safety during the procedure by observing your motor skills, checking muscle and nerve health, and monitoring your reaction to touch, pressure, and pain. Our surgeons are supported by a team of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and neurosurgical nurses who monitor your progress and care for you with compassion, starting before surgery and continuing through recovery. Conditions We Treat with Spine Surgery We treat a broad range of conditions that affect the spine: degenerative conditions, such as osteoarthritis of the spine complex spinal problems associated with a previous failed surgery scoliosis and kyphosis in in children adults cervical and lumbar herniated discs neuromuscular diseases spinal cord and spinal column tumors all spinal fractures, including spine compression fractures spine trauma intradural and extradural spinal pathologies vascular lesions of the spinal cord and spinal column congenital conditions such as , tethered cord syndrome, diastematomyelia, Chiari malformations, and hemivertebrae Spine Procedures We Perform Our surgeons have expertise in a range of surgical procedures, some of which can be performed on an outpatient basis, allowing you to return home the same day. Discectomy or Microdiscectomy Discectomy and microdiscectomy both refer to decompression surgeries to remove the portion of a disc that is herniated and pressing on a nerve. These procedures preserve mobility. Cervical Laminoplasty and Laminectomy During this decompression procedure, a surgeon enlarges the spinal canal, the space through which the spinal cord passes, to alleviate stenosis and preserve mobility. Foraminotomy Foraminotomy is a decompression procedure in which surgeons enlarge the space through which a nerve passes out of the spinal canal. These spaces, called foramina, can become partially blocked with bone or other tissue. Surgeons remove the obstruction to free the nerve and preserve mobility. Laminectomy and Laminotomy During a laminectomy, a surgeon removes the back part of a vertebra, called the lamina, to provide more space to a nerve or a portion of the spinal cord that is being compressed. If only a portion of the lamina is affecting the nerve, the surgeon may remove some of the tissue in a procedure called laminotomy. Both procedures preserve mobility. Disc Replacement In a disc replacement, which is performed to decompress nerves or part of the spinal cord in the cervical or lumbar spine, surgeons replace a worn or damaged disc between two vertebrae with an artificial disc, or “spacer.” No plates or fusion is needed for this procedure, which preserves mobility. Your doctor may recommend disc replacement rather than spinal fusion if you have a herniated disc in your neck and are younger than 65. Spine Fusion Surgery Spine fusion surgery is performed to stabilize the spine or to straighten a crooked spine. During the procedure, a surgeon permanently joins, or fuses, two or more vertebrae in the spine. As the vertebrae heal, they become one solid bone. This prevents the vertebrae from moving in a way that compresses or irritates the nerve. Spinal fusion is performed to treat some spinal degenerative conditions and spinal deformities such as scoliosis or kyphosis, as well as broken or unstable vertebrae and conditions including spondylolisthesis. Vertebral Body Tethering Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is a minimally invasive spine surgery to treat children with scoliosis. During this procedure, a surgeon places a flexible cord, or tether, to pull the spine into alignment as the child grows. VBT is one alternative to traditional surgical techniques such as spinal fusion surgery Dedicated Spine and Neurosurgery Operating Rooms Many of our spine surgeries are performed at NYU Langone’s in dedicated spine and neurosurgery operating rooms—which feature the most advanced technology available, including navigation, robotics, intraoperative CT, and MRI scanning—on dedicated neuroscience floors, where all team members specialize in caring for people who have spine conditions. We have Spine Center locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as on Long Island. To make an appointment, call Become a Living Kidney Donor Support the Living Kidney Donor Program Make a monetary donation to support our living kidney donor program. Although the number of patients added to the national kidney transplant waiting list increases each year, the number of available donors stays roughly the same. This means potential kidney recipients must often wait to receive lifesaving care for , a part of the , our doctors perform kidney transplants from living donors. This approach allows for shorter wait times and timely treatment of kidney disease, which can improve the outcomes of recipients. Organ Donation by Living Kidney Donors For living kidney donation, donors provide one of their two kidneys for a transplant. The remaining kidney is fully functioning and ensures that the donor remains healthy and has a good quality of life. Surgical techniques, including minimally invasive kidney removal, have made it easier for family members and others to donate a kidney to a loved one in need. Patient Milissa Rocker Klotz and Dr. Bruce Gelb talk about Milissa’s living donor kidney transplant. There is no financial or medical benefit to donating a kidney. However, many people find helping another person to live longer with a better quality of life and no need for dialysis is incredibly rewarding. Any healthy individual can be a donor, not only immediate family members. Nondirected donation involves donating to a stranger. Paired kidney exchange, also called paired donation, matches incompatible pairs for transplants. These options allow anyone to become a living donor.Our experts complete an extensive evaluation process to minimize the risks to the donor. Benefits of Living Kidney Donation Kidneys from living donors typically last longer in recipients than kidneys from deceased donors. When a kidney is received from a deceased donor, organ transplant surgery must occur within a short timeframe. A living donor kidney provides the recipient with the ability to prepare for surgery. The date of the procedure can be planned around the donor’s schedule, as well as the schedule of the medical team and the recipient. Doctors can also schedule kidney transplant surgery at a time when the kidney recipient is doing well medically. The healthier the recipient is before transplant, the better. We aim to perform transplant early enough in the disease process, before other organs and systems are affected. This allows for a safer procedure, helps with the recovery process, and improves surgical outcomes. Living Kidney Donor Consultation Kidney donor candidates must complete a series of medical examinations and interviews with our transplant team to determine whether they are appropriate candidates for living donation surgery. The consultation may include the following: blood tests to check kidney function and to determine donor blood type and tissue type, which ensures compatibility for a recipient urine tests to help screen for kidney disease and for urinary tract infection imaging tests such as X-rays and MRI or CT scans to check the structure and function of the kidneys evaluation by a cardiologist to ensure any is controlled, an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check the heart’s electrical activity, and a possible echocardiogram, an imaging test to evaluate the heart’s structure and function pulmonary tests to check lung function a meeting with a social worker or psychologist to ensure the donor is prepared for the organ donation process a discussion with a transplant surgeon and nephrologist, which is a kidney specialist a meeting with an independent living donor advocate, who ensures that the donor’s interests are represented When this evaluation is complete, our transplant team meets with the potential donor to discuss test results and candidacy. If the team agrees, the surgery is planned around the donor’s and recipient’s schedules. What to Expect from Kidney Donor Surgery Our doctors are experts in kidney transplantation . For living donor kidney surgery, doctors perform a nephrectomy, which is the surgical removal of a healthy kidney. Surgeons typically use laparoscopy, a minimally invasive approach that requires making a small incision in the lower abdomen. After surgery, the donor may remain in the hospital for a couple days for observation and can typically return to regular activities after six weeks. If you are interested in becoming a living kidney donor, you can complete a confidential health screening for kidney donations To learn more about kidney donation or to speak with a donor team specialist, call 212-263-3621 NYUTrLivingDonor@NYULangone.org 530 First Avenue, 5th Floor View All Locations (8) 646-501-0119 Our Care Team HFpEF Program At NYU Langone’s Heart Failure Advanced Care Center, our experts are specially trained to evaluate and treat people with any stage or type of —including those who are considering a , a total artificial heart, or a VIDEO: Our doctors discuss how personalized treatment can help patients manage heart failure.
