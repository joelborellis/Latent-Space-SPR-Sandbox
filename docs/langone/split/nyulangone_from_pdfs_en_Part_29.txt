LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualTABLE OF CONTENTSINTRODUCTIONPURPOSE OF THIS MANUAL “A world class, patient centered, integrated academic medical center.”To achieve the vision NYU Langone Health, Real Estate Development and Facilities has been growing the institution’s landscape through mergers and capital improvement projects. RED&F’s program of Signage & Wayfinding has taken measures to improve an individual’s journey to these facilities, and ease navigation through its multiple campuses. This Standards Manual further develops and documents the policy, strategy and design standards of the NYU Langone Health Wayfinding and Communications Master Plan. The purpose of the Manual is to provide graphic and technical specifications for the integrated wayfinding and communications system to be consistently implemented throughout the hospital’s facilities. Expected language, design, and placement of the system’s components is imperative to building a trusted and reliable wayfinding and communications system. Both the Master Plan and Standards Manual documents should be referenced by relevant consultants and staff members when implementing the system. This Manual is a living, working document which will evolve and be adapted to the environmental branding and wayfinding communication needs of NYU Langone Health. In conjunction with the Manual, RED+F will be the arbiter of any future revisions, variations, and interpretations on project specific customization of the signage.SCOPE OF THIS MANUAL The integrated system outlined in the Manual includes signage, digital tools, printed communications, and human interactions to improve navigation. It also outlines the framework for the development of the Centralized Database, a single, reliable and dedicated information source that is the foundation of the entire system, and which will enable the integrated system to grow and change, as needed, in real time. CHAPTER 1 This chapter outlines overarching graphic standards that extend to all printed and digital communications, as well as signage, for reference by all users of the Manual. CHAPTER 2 This chapter provides an overview of the overall integrated wayfinding system including the sign type family, digital components, and communications materials. Guidelines for programming sign types are also outlined, for reference by all users of the Manual. CHAPTERS 3 4 Construction intent documentation for all custom exterior and interior sign types are detailed in Chapters 3 and 4 for bidding purposes. Layout examples for signage that has been implemented to date have been included as guidelines for all similar signage at other facilities, for reference by all design consultants. CHAPTER 5 Construction intent documentation for all modular system sign types have been detailed in this chapter for bidding purposes. This chapter includes the majority of the necessary sign types for all facilities. Relevant pages should be pulled for bid purposes for all future projects by RED&F and/or design consultants. Additional sign types required for unique conditions should be based upon the aesthetic outlined in the Manual.CHAPTER 6 Construction intent documentation for all donor sign types have been detailed in this chapter, as well as guidelines for specifying sign types based upon tiered gift values. This chapter should be referenced by Development, RED&F, and all design consultants. CHAPTER 7 This chapter provides an overview of digital wayfinding and regulatory screen functionality and design. UX standards are detailed here, as well as graphic standards for homescreens, maps, and directional layouts. Additionally, this chapter provides outlines of the content management systems developed for each sign type. CHAPTER 8 This chapter provides guidelines for the printed formats of the family of NYU Langone Health maps.CHAPTER 9 Boilerplate technical specifications for signage bidding purposes.APPENDIX Reference documents including symbol vector artwork, full size typography samples, digital signage shop drawings and content management handbooks.

Visibility should be studied, especially for overhead sign types, where architectural elements may create viewing obstacles.If deemed appropriate, multiple sign panels with the same installation height may be installed side by side with 3" space between panels.Over signing should be avoided so as not to overwhelm patients and visitors and to alleviate visual clutter.Custom Interior Sign Types (Chapter 4) have been designed for use in high traffic public corridors. Consideration should be given to the nature of the location when determining the use of Custom Sign Types. Material and Paint Finishes should be coordinated with the NYU Langone Health Design Team and their consultants.2.3.1© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualPROGRAMMING GUIDELINESCustom Interior Sign Types (Chapter 4) should be used at the Main Campus on the first floor corridors designated as wayfinding pathways (i.e. Green Pathway, Blue Pathway, Yellow Pathway). These sign types are intended to reinforce the wayfinding strategy at the Main Campus.Modular Interior Sign Types (Chapter 5) should be used throughout the Main Campus. These sign types are used for room identification, regulatory information, and upper level wayfinding. All modular signs programmed to be located on a first floor corridor designated as a wayfinding pathway (i.e. Green Pathway, Blue Pathway, Yellow Pathway) should correspond to the Pathway paint finish. For all other locations at the Main Campus, F2 (Standard Neutral) should be specified. PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES: MAIN CAMPUS FINISHESBlue PathwayYou are on theTisch ElevatorsKimmel ElevatorsHassenfeld ElevatorsPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES: HASSENFELD FINISHESCustom Interior Sign Types incorporating the Hassenfeld Brand should be employed at entrances and reception areas of all Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital areas. Refer to Chapter 4 for the design requirements of these sign types.Certain Modular Interior Sign Types can be modified to incorporate the Hassenfeld Brand. These modified sign types should be used for patient facing room identification, regulatory information, and wayfinding at all Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital areas. When creating sign location plans and documentation, maintain the typical Chapter 5 Sign Type designation and refer to Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for layout and finish modifications.2.3.2© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualPROGRAMMING GUIDELINESJ2 L4 056K1 L4 064J2 L4 062J2 L4 061J2 L4 055J1 L4 060J1 L4 059J1 L4 052G1 L4 058J1 L4 051H4 L4 087H4 L4 092K2 L4 137H4 L4 011H4 L4 013K1 L4 155E4 L4 156U1 L4 163H4 L4 138H4 L4 009H4 L4 085K2 L4 093K2 L4 095K2 L4 099K2 L4 101H4 L4 103K2 L4 084H4 L4 088H4 L4 091K2 L4 142H4 L4 012H4 L4 014K1 L4 153E4 L4 154W2 L4 162J1 L4 161A3 L4 047K2 L4 134H4 L4 135K2 L4 136H4 L4 143J2 L4 160R5 L4 004VV1 L4 165VV2 L4 166T1 L4 003Q1 L4 168F2 L4 005X1 L4 006X2 L4 176X3 L4 007X3 L4 169B6 L4 001A1 L4 002X3 L4 174B7 L4 140B7 L4 049K1 L4 146J1 L4 148J2 L4 159J2 L4 017H4 L4 019H4 L4 015H4 L4 016J1 L4 018J1 L4 020J2 L4 021T2 L4 173K1 L4 034W2 L4 037W2 L4 030W2 L4 024W2 L4 008K2 L4 035K2 L4 036X3 L4 038H4 L4 040J1 L4 039J1 L4 043H4 L4 041H4 L4 042J1 L4 033J1 L4 170J2 L4 172J1 L4 044J1 L4 046T2 L4 045U1 L4 027VV2 L4 167K2 L4 026K2 L4 032B7 L4 171K2 L4 022K2 L4 028K2 L4 025K2 L4 031K2 L4 023K2 L4 029J2 L4 158J2 L4 157J1 L4 147J1 L4 150J1 L4 149J1 L4 151J2 L4 145K2 L4 141H4 L4 010K2 L4 133K2 L4 086K2 L4 094K2 L4 096K2 L4 100K2 L4 102K2 L4 104J1 L4 098J1 L4 097J1 L4 083W2 L4 050W2 L4 089J1 L4 053J1 L4 057J1 L4 054J1 L4 065J1 L4 068E5 L4 076E5 L4 069E5 L4 070E5 L4 071E5 L4 072E5 L4 075E5 L4 074E5 L4 073H4 L4 066H4 L4 109H4 L4 110H4 L4 111H4 L4 115K2 L4 126W2 L4 125H4 L4 123H4 L4 121H4 L4 124H4 L4 119W2 L4 139W2 L4 132W2 L4 152K2 L4 127H4 L4 128H4 L4 129K2 L4 130K2 L4 131W2 L4 116W2 L4 090K2 L4 112K2 L4 113K2 L4 114J1 L4 117J1 L4 118K2 L4 078K2 L4 079K2 L4 080J1 L4 081K1 L4 082H4 L4 067H4 L4 077H4 L4 105U1 L4 108J1 L4 107K1 L4 063T2 L4 1752.3.3© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualNOTESThis sample location plan illustrates where signs should be installed.

This confirmation is achieved through consistent application of the approved information hierarchy (see NYU Langone Health Wayfinding and Communications Master Plan, Chapter 3: Wayfinding and Communications Strategy).In addition to consistency of message, the application of a unified aesthetic is critical to providing an easily recognizable cue for individuals to confirm their arrival.Each NYU Langone Health facility will require several types of signage at any given entrance. The enterprise identity, building name and address, donor recognition, and directional signage must all co exist at the entrance. While not every sign type will be used at every entrance, it is important to consider the placement of information such that it conforms with a consistent hierarchy across all facilities.All exterior signage is subject to total square footage allowances as determined by city zoning permits and/or variances.Information HierarchyMulti Entrance Facility RequirementsSingle Entrance Facility RequirementsSign TypeDISTANCE VIEW1.

This system is designed to provide multiple combinations for the constantly evolving needs of NYU Langone Health. The following chapter specifies how these components combine to create a unified approach for the NYU Langone Health Sign System.5.0.1© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® OVERVIEW52.50 mm(2.067")21.00 mm(0.827")2100.00 mm(6' 10.677")2100.00 mm(6' 10.677")INFONORM® OVERVIEW: THE GRIDThe Infonorm® Grid determines the width and height measurement for every sign in the NYULH Modular System. Infonorm® utilizes the Metric System, however, where possible the US Customary equivalent has been identified. The standard grid unit is 52 1/2 mm (2.067" +/ ) by 21 mm (0.827" +/ ) .Signs may be created up to 2100 mm (82.677" +/ ) by 2100 mm (82.677" +/ ).When required, US standard paper sizes may be specified for use in insert holders. These sign types will not adhere to the Infonorm® Grid, so their use should be limited. This will allow for ease of ordering Infonorm® parts and a consistent design throughout NYULH. 5.0.2© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® OVERVIEWInfonorm® GridIn SessionIn Session8 1/2" x 11"8 1/2" x 11"YYYYYY2YY2YY2Y2YY2.5YY3YSYSTEM OVERVIEW: TYPICAL WIDTHS FOR ROOM SIGNSThe Infonorm® sign system within this chapter has been developed to accommodate as many scenarios as possible, however, if a new sign is required, the existing proportions should used to develop additional signs.NYULH room identification signs are offered in two typical widths 157.50 mm (6 7/16") and 212.90 mm (8 1/2"). Each of these widths has a series of varying heights, designed to accommodate a range of message types (i.e. temporary insert, tactile room numbers, non tactile message) and lengths. Additional elements in these widths are then added to the sign panels to accommodate the user’s need (e.g. insert panels or in session sliders).This diagram shows some of the panel options and elements that make up the current system and may be used to create new signs.5.0.3© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® OVERVIEW157.50 mm width Signs157.50 mm width Elements212.90 mm width Signs212.90 mm width ElementsINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONS: BASE AND COVER PROFILESThree main components make up every Infonorm® sign, the Base Profile, the Cover Profile, and the End Caps. In addition, Infonorm® provides standard insert holders in typical sizes, including 8 1/2" x 11", 8 1/2" x 5 1/2", and 11" x 17". The Base Profile The Base Profile is an extruded aluminum plate with tracks that hold the Cover Profile. Standard extrusion sizes are available up to the grid height 168 mm (6 5/8" +/ ). Sign types with heights greater than 168 mm will require multiple Base Profiles assembled together.Cover Profiles The standard Cover Profile is an extruded aluminum face plate with guides that slide into the Base Profile tracks. Standard extrusion sizes are available up to the grid height 168 mm (6 5/8" +/ ).Thin Cover Profiles are slimmer than the standard Cover Profile and accommodate the application of a thin mil panel over multiple Thin Cover Profiles to make a seamless full height sign. Thin Cover Profiles are also used in all sign types requiring photopolymer or tactile copy. Special Cover ProfilesFrame Profile 001 is used to create the top and bottom frames of non insert panels, well as the frame that separates two panels on the same Base Profile. Frame Profile 1.2 is used for larger sign types to allow for the use of thicker panels and for directories that require thicker acrylic windows. Most sign types within the NYULH system are made with Profile 001 and the Thin Cover Profile.5.0.4© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONSBase ProfileCover ProfileThin Cover Profile Frame Profile 001Frame Profile 1.2Base Profile TracksCover Profile GuidesThin Cover ProfileThin Cover ProfileThin Cover ProfilePhotopolymerPhotopolymerBase ProfileBase ProfileThin Cover ProfileThin Cover ProfileProfile 001Profile 001Profile 001Profile 1.2Profile 1.2Thin mil panelThin mil full height panelInfonorm® Standard InsertINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONS: END CAPS AND SECURITY DEVICESEnd Caps The End Caps are aluminum extrusions which attach to the Base Profile tracks to secure the Cover Profiles in place. Sign Types in this Manual use one of three (3) different End Caps, TE, E10 or Quick Click. The Infonorm® TE Picture Frame End Caps are the typical endcap for most signs in the NYULH system.The Infonorm® E10 10mm End Caps are used for larger signs where thicker frames are required.The Quick Click Endcaps are used for changeable paper insert holders.Security DevicesThe Tamper Resistant Spring Lock will be used in all instances where permanent messages are displayed. These include tactile room numbers, room identification names, etc. In order to access the message panels, a Security Key Tool is required to compress the lock and release the end cap. Coordinate with RED+F for access to this Security Key Tool. The Quick Click Profile and Insert will be used in semi permanent insert requirements. These types include identification signs, regulatory signs, etc. 5.0.5© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONSTE Picture Frame EndcapSpring LockE10 10mm EndcapQuick Click EndcapVisible FrameVisible FrameVisible FrameLocking Notches Locking Notches Security Key Access Security Key Access Spring LockTE Endcap Base ProfileSecurity Key Access MagnetAlignAlignINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONS: INSTALLATIONThe mounting conditions for the signs will vary from site to site and location to location. This will require a variety of mounting components. Wherever possible, all Infonorm® signs should be mounted to existing walls with fully concealed mechanical fasteners, to facilitate future reloca tion by NYU Langone Health. When panel size or weight requires, signs can be mounted with z clips.If the sign is to be mounted to glass, it should be done so with fully concealed VHB adhesive and a back up panel or vinyl should be used to conceal adhesives.For workstation or partial height wall condi tions where mechanical fasteners are not achievable, the sign can be mounted with VHB adhesive.5.0.6© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONSTypical Mechanical FastenerZ Clip Glass ConditionWorkstation Wall ConditionShim Shim Back up panel or vinylWorkstation wallShimMechanical FastenersZ clipsShimExisting wallExisting wallExisting glassMultipurposeSeminar RoomJonathan P.
