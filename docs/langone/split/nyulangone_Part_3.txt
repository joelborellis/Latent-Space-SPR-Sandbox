Physicians often spend up to a decade in training after earning their medical degree, a timeline that only gets longer as medicine grows increasingly complex and collaborative. To address these challenges, we pioneered the first three-year medical degree program among top academic medical schools in 2013. The goal was simple yet bold: reduce the burden of educational debt while giving students a head start on their apprenticeships as residents. Our innovative curriculum prioritizes early clinical immersion and mentorship, equipping students with the skills and guidance needed to thrive in their chosen fields, all while maintaining the highest standards of medical education. In fact, the largest study of its kind confirmed that our three-year students achieve the same milestones and meet the same rigorous requirements as their peers in traditional four-year programs. The ultimate validation, however, is the clinic: our graduates consistently excel in prestigious residency programs and competitive fellowships, making a significant impact in their fields.
