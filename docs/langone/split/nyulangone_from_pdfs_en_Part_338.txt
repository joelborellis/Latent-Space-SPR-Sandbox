Substitute products, such as duct tape or masking tape are prohibited. 4.3 Have brazed fittings, installed in accordance with NFPA 99 (2012). • During brazing, joints shall be continuously purged with oil free, dry nitrogen to prevent the formation of copper oxide on the inside surfaces of the joint. 5.0 Testing 5.1 Personnel (i.e., staff or a vendor) with ASSE 6010 certification shall conduct testing, in accordance with ASSE 6010. When a vendor conducts the testing, the Project Manager (PM) and/or a representative of Respiratory Therapy, Facilities, Real Estate, or an authority having jurisdiction, as applicable shall witness the testing. The PM shall maintain documentation of findings in the project file. At NYU Langone Hospital Long Island (NYULH LI), the PM shall provide the Chief Engineer with records of results, and the Chief Engineer shall maintain those records. • Certified personnel shall conduct an Initial Pressure Test when all rough assemblies are completed. The test shall be conducted at 1.5 times the working pressure but not less than 150 pounds per square inch (psi). It shall include a check for leaks, with retest if leaks are identified. For vacuum systems, it shall be conducted at 60 psi with soapy water or equivalent. Policy No. 133 Policy: Medical Gas Outlets and Piping Page 3 of 4 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Revised: June 1, 2021 • Certified personnel shall conduct a Standing Pressure Test for 24 hours at above normal working pressure. The test shall include a check for leaks, with retest if leaks are identified. For vacuum systems, it shall be conducted at no less than 12 inches of mercury (Hg). • Following pressure testing, certified personnel shall purge lines with oil free, dry nitrogen in accordance with NFPA 99 (2012) to ensure that no debris remains in the piping. • A certified vendor shall conduct purity testing (of all lines affected) with oil free, nitrogen gas, and submit the results to Facilities or Real Estate for review. • The certified vendor shall conduct a final Tie In Test at normal system pressure. 6.0 Labeling 6.1 All piping shall be labeled in accordance with NFPA 99 (2012). See summary information in Appendices A and B. 6.2 Adapters (“Christmas trees”) utilized for connection of patient medical supply tubing (e.g. Nasal cannula, non rebreather, ambu bag, etc.) to Oxygen and Medical Air flow meters must be clear in color. 7.0 Preventive maintenance Facilities or Real Estate, as applicable, shall coordinate preventive maintenance of medical gas systems. 7.1 Maintenance shall include inspection and testing of the entire medical gas distribution systems at least annually. 7.2 The testing shall be completed by certified personnel meeting the requirements of ASSE 6030. 7.3 Maintenance and repairs shall be conducted by certified personnel meeting the requirements of ASSE 6030 and/or 6040.
