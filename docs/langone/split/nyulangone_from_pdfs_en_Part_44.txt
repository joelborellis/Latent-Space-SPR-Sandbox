also be determined at this time.  “As Built” Documentation The Architect shall provide the Security Vendor and Security Department with copies of the finalized “As Built” in electronic form acceptable for import into BuildFlow. 3. General Requirements for Security Design The Architect shall follow the security requirements listed below in the design of the project:  Any code issues, such as fire and life safety, that affect security operations must be addressed by the Architect.  Interior Common spaces should not be isolated from entrances or stairs. Consider location of permanent staff in multiple locations within spaces to limit possibility of unoccupied spaces that cannot be monitored. Consider use of interior glazing and other strategies to improve visibility and accessibility. If a security officer post is included in the design, consider sightlines from the seated position.  Security access control and alarm systems on the superblock must be compatible and integrated with the existing system at the NYU Langone Security Operations Center. Systems off the superblock will be evaluated on a case by case basis as to their need to be tied into the existing system or if they can be stand alone and tied into a central station for monitoring and subsequent response.  Cameras are required at all lobbies, laundry rooms, cash handling areas, elevators, stair doors, entrance and egress doors, as well as any other areas as recommended by NYU Langone Health.  All windows should be lockable.  A/E Team should alert NYU Langone Health to security conditions that are not immediately apparent but would have operational impact, such as emergency egress doors that are on hold opens.  Areas of high security risk generally include where cash, narcotics, or retail operations are planned, as well as areas housing behavioral health (i.e. Psychiatry), Infant/Pediatric, Emergency Department, TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) or ICU patients. These areas require greater access control, panic alarms and camera coverage. In some cases, specialized systems, such as Infant/Patient tracking and monitoring systems need to be incorporated into the design to include emergency card reader override buttons and one button lockdown feature as required. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 339 2023  IDF closets require Lenel security systems and IP camera installed within. Access will be controlled by the MCIT Department.  Exterior Lighting design must carefully consider appropriate light levels without compromising security. Employ “passive” security design strategies such as avoiding dead end spaces and blind corners, and areas that are isolated from foot traffic or out of sight. Consider relationship of ground floor spaces to the exterior for sightlines and access to open windows and doors. Where security officer posts are required, consider issues of congestion, sightlines, ADA compliance and the physical comfort (furniture and HVAC) of the personnel. 4. Related Security Design Guidelines  NYPD has published security guidelines entitled Engineering Security, Protective Design for High Risk Buildings. Where applicable these guidelines are to be referenced and utilized as necessary.

NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines DOS AND DON’TS Real Estate Development and Facilities 346 2023 DOS AND DON’TS As part of our approach to continually improve the Design and Construction process, we at RED+F maintain a running list of Dos and Don’ts. This is a detailed list of items that we have found to work well (or not work well) for NYU Langone Health capital construction projects. We have listed these items in the following order: Architectural Interior Design Medical & Lab Equipment AV/IT & A/E Team Coordination Architectural 1. Make sure patient room and patient toilet room saddles have no lip (not even code allowable 1/4"). Patients cannot negotiate with IV pole. 2. Make sure there are bed stops in Patient Rooms. 3. Where wall mounted soap dispensers are used, place them above countertops instead of above floors, so any drippings go on the counter. 4. Do not specify storage cabinets under sinks; use ADA compliant panels instead. The area under sinks should be clear. It will fail DOH survey if storage is located underneath. 5. Provide the construction budget and schedule to the A/E Team before start of design. The A/E Team needs to design within budgetary and time constraints. They can’t do that without a budget and schedule. 6. Obtain user equipment lists and determine infrastructure requirements (i.e. power requirements) ASAP so a test fit can be performed. 7. Floating ceilings might require sprinkler coverage ON TOP of them. Check it. 8. Be sure that room numbering adheres to NYU Langone standards. Device schedules need to match (for Fire Alarm Programming). 9. The Tisch Ancillary building is a balloon frame construction. There is no fire stopping between the slab and curtain wall. Design drawings to address this. Millhauser is similar. 10. Do not 'float' HIPPA divider panels between desks. Sandwich the panels tight to the desks with no gaps for added stability and to prevent pens, papers, etc. from falling through. 11. Add card readers to all clean supply rooms. 12. Make sure mounting height of ADA mirrors is specified for the bottom of the reflective surface to be 40" AFF, not the mirror frame. 13. Camera locations need to be coordinated with the Security PM, Security vendor and the MCIT PM. 14. The Architect should do a file/storage survey during planning to make sure adequate file and storage space is factored into the design. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines DOS AND DON’TS Real Estate Development and Facilities 347 2023 15. Provide electric locks for single doors and overhead electric strikes for glass doors. Avoid the use of maglocks whenever possible. 16. All interior finish and furniture drawings and specifications are to be uploaded to BuildFlow upon closeout. 17. MER doors to have Trilogy keypad locksets with T2 keyway. Must coordinate with NYU Langone locksmith. 18. Firestopping products shall not be used unless required for fire or smoke barriers. All firestopping must be performed by a certified tradespersons in firestopping, contracted under either the GC/CM. Making individual trades responsible for firestopping their own penetrations is not acceptable. They must use only Hilti products (unless otherwise allowed in the Design Guidelines), and must use UL approved systems. A Special Inspection is required by NYC DOB and NYU Langone Facility Operations. 19. Cable trays are not to penetrate smoke or fire barriers. Cable trays are to stop at wall with cables traversing through EZ Path devices, then resume with cable trays past penetration. Coordinate with MCIT PM. 20. Consideration must be given to additional data drop conduits and back boxes (with drag lines) to all rooms. Furniture layouts change, often times during construction, and the only drops in the room are behind furniture. This is especially the case with wall mounted computer work stations. Similarly, additional wall grounds are to be provided on a second wall in the event this location changes as well to avoid tearing open newly created walls. Interior Design 1. Coordinate power/data drops with under counter pedestal files, etc. 2. Make best efforts to marry up to a column / wall to reduce core drilling for power and data. 3. No visible whips are allowed when connecting to workstations. 4. Coordinate cable management with furniture (V30 training room cables hanging from desktops and visible). 5. Purchase construction cores on wall / door systems, not pre keyed cores. The main campus locksmith will provide final cores. For off campus facilities, engage a locksmith. 6. Specify wardrobe closets in workstations and private offices whenever possible. Provide lockers elsewhere when this is not feasible. 7. Get signage requirements early to have permanent signage at opening. PM to provide the Signage / Wayfinding PM the project schedule. 8. Specify and install coat hooks in each toilet stall, single occupancy restroom, private office, exam room, changing room, lactation room, wellness room, etc. 9. Avoid specifying products that require overseas delivery unless stocked in the United States. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines DOS AND DON’TS Real Estate Development and Facilities 348 2023 Medical / Lab Equipment 1. Do not provide UV lights as an option when ordering new Bio Safety Cabinets for a lab or other type of project. 2. Do not specify direct ducted bio safety cabinets. Canopy connected A 2's with 70/30 air circulation are preferred. There are exceptions. Please review with EH&S before specifying. 3. Provide cabinets with side ports to allow tubing and wiring to be passed through the side as opposed to the front as a default. Review exceptions with EH&S before specifying. 4. Provide height adjustable biosafety cabinets as a default. Review exceptions with EH&S before specifying. AV/IT & A/E Team Coordination 1. A/E Team shall fully coordinate with the IT consultant engaged directly with NYU Langone. Refer to the Information Technology subsection for further information. 2. IT Engineer infrastructure specification needs to be placed on the "E" drawings so that the electrical contractor can buy and install. 3. No MEP Services should pass through the IDF rooms that are not servicing the room. 4. Cable trays to be shown on all A/E drawings and coordinated appropriately with MCIT and the contractors. "Coordinate in field" is not acceptable. 5. Define who will buy the server UPS, Electrical or Low Voltage contractor PRE BID. 6. Determine the power requirement at the rack early in the project. 7. Define AV equipment credenza ventilation requirements. 8. Coordinate light fixture locations to avoid racks / ladder racks. Wall mounted lights are acceptable. 9. Multiple outlets mounted above rack. Specifications should come from IT designer. Place the information on the Electrical plans for electrician to install. 10. Provide UPS to the rack. IT designer to specify the UPS. Electrical drawings shall show the UPS to be bought. 11. Each IDF room gets its own electrical panel. Power panels are to have surge suppressors. 12. Security panels typically go in IDF rooms. They require power and data connection. Coordinate requirements with the MCIT PM. 13. Cable Trays are to be designed by the IT designer, shown on the Electrical drawings and bought by the electrical contractor. It is critical that the cable tray path is coordinated with the MEP systems. 14. Coordinate pathway for conduits to building main IT rooms (BMS). Architects should include some allowance for demolition, temporary protection, patching, firestopping, etc. in the architectural plans. Instructions to Engineer for preparing a design and specification: I. It shall be the Engineer’s responsibility to follow these NYU Langone Health guidelines on all projects located on the main campus. For projects that are located off campus, the Engineer shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with the building landlord’s requirements. II. The information listed below is a guideline only. It shall be the Engineer’s responsibility to conform to all appropriate building code requirements. III. All projects shall be designed in accordance with the applicable New York City Building Code, Mechanical Code, Fuel Gas Code, Fire Code, Energy Conservation Code, and the applicable standards referenced by these codes. IV. These Guidelines will be updated periodically and suggestions for updates may be made to the NYU Langone Project Manager. Requests and proposals for changes to the guidelines should be made in writing to a NYU Langone Project Manager assigned to the project who will forward such requests to RED+F Facilities Operations, as appropriate for review. RED+F Facilities Operations will advise the PM and Engineer in writing whether an exception to the Guidelines will be permitted or not.
