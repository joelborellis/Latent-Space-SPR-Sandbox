ensure that only a safe level of radiation is emitted. During an X-ray, each study is focused on the area of the body that is of most interest to your doctor, to avoid any unnecessary radiation to other parts of your body. Our X-ray technologists also use radiation shields and aprons to protect areas that are sensitive to radiation and not necessary for the imaging tests, such as the breasts in women and reproductive organs in men and women. We also use tracking and monitoring systems to ensure that our nuclear medicine imaging equipment is working properly and that the radiation is controlled within safe, standard limits.

Expert Neurovascular Treatment We provide the most advanced care for people who have disorders affecting blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord. NYU Langone’s Center for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases is one of the premier centers in the world for the medical, surgical, and endovascular treatment of diseases that affect the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord. People are regularly referred to us from across the country and around the world, and our experts devise solutions for conditions considered untreatable elsewhere. Our center brings together leading experts in neurology, neurosurgery, neurocritical care, neuro-interventional radiology, neuroradiology, and neurorehabilitation. They specialize in diagnosing and treating people who have the most difficult and complex disorders affecting blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord, as well as recommending preventive strategies for those who may be at high risk for these conditions. Our doctors provide ongoing care for people who have experienced or are at risk for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) , and people who have a complex neurovascular disease such as a brain aneurysm, arteriovenous malformations , dural and arteriovenous fistulas, vascular tumors, cavernous malformations, carotid stenosis , and carotid or vertebral dissection. People who have experienced a stroke or TIA and those with complex neurovascular diseases have a specialized set of medical needs. We provide highly specialized care to people recovering from brain injury and surgical treatments in our neurointensive care units at , and Our experienced team of clinicians helps patients navigate treatment and offers access to a full spectrum of resources designed to expertly manage clinical care, including rehabilitation and recovery services at and risk reduction programs at NYU Langone’s Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Specialized Medical Care for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases NYU Langone’s Comprehensive Stroke Center is an integral part of the Center for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases and provides advanced stroke care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. With locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn, the Comprehensive Stroke Center offers rapid diagnosis, effective treatment, multidisciplinary preventive strategies, and advanced rehabilitative care for people who have experienced or are at risk for a stroke. Our team at the Center for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases collaborates with Comprehensive Stroke Center experts to coordinate care from stroke risk identification through treatment and recovery. Our vascular neurologists create individualized treatment plans for patients based on the stroke subtype and any other contributing factors. During an acute stroke, our vascular neurologists are among the first team members to see a patient. They rapidly triage patients and assess the need for emergency treatment. If a stroke diagnosis is confirmed, they create an individualized treatment plan based on the stroke subtype and any other contributing factors. Some people at risk for stroke may receive intravenous drugs to dissolve a blood clot, or a procedure to remove the clot with a catheter. Some people with more serious injury may need the neurocritical care provided by specialty trained neuro-intensivists and nurses in our intensive care units. A patient care coordinator guides you through any lifestyle changes and medical care that may be recommended to prevent stroke and its complications. Advanced Surgical Care Our specialists provide a full range of advanced treatment approaches, including open microneurosurgery, in which tiny instruments and microscopes are used to perform procedures on the smallest blood vessels. They also perform endovascular surgery, which enables surgeons to use the blood vessels as direct pathways to the part of the body that needs treatment. Our doctors offer radiosurgery with Gamma Knife technology , which allows for the precise delivery of radiation when treating people with blood vessel conditions in the brain, such as brain arteriovenous malformations. Leaders in Stroke Research Experts at Rusk Rehabilitation’s Motor Recovery Research Lab conduct clinical trials to develop better treatment options and care for people who have had a stroke. Learn More About Stroke Research The highly skilled neurosurgeons at our also specialize in performing extracranial–intracranial bypass surgery—often called cranial bypass or cerebral bypass surgery—to improve blood flow to the brain and prevent strokes. Our team has years of experience performing this surgical technique for people who are at risk for recurrent stroke or bleeding inside the brain. Our world-class facilities include hybrid surgical suites that feature built-in three-dimensional and four-dimensional imaging technology and computer image guidance systems that our doctors use to treat the most complex conditions. This type of image-guided surgery aids your doctor in making important decisions such as determining the best place to make an incision, the optimal path to the targeted area, and the critical areas in the brain or spinal cord to avoid. The use of this technology has been shown to shorten the length of surgery, decrease the size of the incision, improve outcomes, and speed recovery.

With heart disease as the leading cause of death in women, our dedicated specialists provide the tools you need to prevent heart disease, and the compassion and support you need to navigate diagnosis and treatment. U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Hospitals” ranks NYU Langone the No. 2 hospital in the nation for cardiology and heart surgery. Women’s Heart Conditions We Treat Our cardiologists treat heart conditions that disproportionately affect women. We create a personalized care plan that may include medications and lifestyle changes such as incorporating heart healthy nutrition, exercise, and stress reduction into your daily routine for the following conditions: heart attack with no blockage , also known as myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), which is different from typical heart attack caused by severe blockage from cholesterol plaque chest pain or angina with no blockage , also known as ischemia (reduced blood flow), with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA); this condition can be caused by coronary microvascular dysfunction, or dysfunction of blood vessels feeding the heart that are too small to be seen on standard imaging tests, or coronary artery spasm, the sudden and temporary tightening of arteries that carry blood to the heart spontaneous coronary dissection (SCAD), a blood collection in a heart artery wall infection or inflammation of the blood vessels, which may temporarily block blood flow to the heart takotsubo syndrome (also known to some as broken heart syndrome), a sudden weakening of the heart muscle that arises with a mentally or physically stressful event such as the death of a loved one Our physicians also work with interventional cardiologists to manage blocked arteries caused by coronary artery disease cardiac surgeons for conditions such as aortic dissection , or a tear in the aorta, and specialists at the Heart Rhythm Center to manage AFib , or other irregular heartbeat disorders. We may refer you to doctors at our Heart Failure Advanced Care Center cardiomyopathy or diastolic heart failure (also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), a condition in which the heart does not relax properly between beats and pumps out less blood. In addition, our cardiologists also work with our cardiac team at our Heart Valve Center to manage heart valve disorders. Providers at the and physiatrists specializing in cardiac rehabilitation services may also be a part of your care team. Our Expertise in Women’s Heart Health Our cardiologists have a deep understanding of your health needs and use the latest technology to ensure an accurate diagnosis. We listen to ensure you feel heard and understand that women who have coronary artery disease or are experiencing a heart attack may describe their symptoms—especially chest pain—differently from men . The same is true for women who are experiencing or other cardiovascular conditions. Advanced Diagnostic Tools In addition to taking a thorough medical and family history, our cardiologists use the latest diagnostic tools to determine the cause of your symptoms. If we suspect a blockage is not the problem, we may order a special provocation test that is available at only a handful of other medical centers in the United States. During this test, we may also check for coronary microvascular dysfunction. We may refer you to our cardiac imaging and testing services to assess the heart and blood vessels. Testing in our cardiac catheterization laboratory may help us to detect blocked arteries. Our women’s cardiology specialists are also exploring new ways to image the heart and blood vessels through our innovative clinical trials. We have discovered that women may benefit from several types of imaging to accurately diagnose their condition. Preventive Care in Women A heart-healthy lifestyle that prioritizes diet, exercise, stress management, and getting enough sleep is one of the most effective ways to prevent heart disease, and we partner with you to help you realize these goals. Certain women are at higher risk of heart disease. Risk factors include or a history of pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes during . Our cardiologists may work with specialists at NYU Langone Heart’s Cardio-Obstetrics Program to manage heart health before, during, and after pregnancy. Hormonal changes that occur with menopause can also raise the risk of heart disease. If you are receiving cancer treatment, your risk for heart problems can increase. Our doctors may refer you to specialists in our Cardio-Oncology Program to support your cardiovascular health as you navigate cancer care. If you are at a high risk of developing a heart condition, we can refer you to our specialists at the Affiliated Programs and Centers Our specialists in women’s cardiology collaborate with a team of experts to manage your heart or vascular condition.

Our highly skilled neurosurgeons have years of experience performing this surgical technique in both adults and children. During this procedure, a blood vessel located outside the skull that flows in the scalp is diverted and connected to a blood vessel in the brain. Rerouting blood flow to the brain provides additional flow that reduces stress on the body’s circulation and lessens the risk of stroke or bleeding inside the brain. Cranial bypass can often be a treatment option for people with moyamoya disease—a rare condition in which the internal carotid arteries that supply blood to the brain become narrowed, limiting blood flow. Our neurosurgeons perform cranial bypass surgery in both adults with moyamoya disease and children with moyamoya disease. Care for children is provided through During your first visit, our doctors review your symptoms, imaging studies such as CT and MRI scans, and other test results to assess the best treatment approach for your condition. For those patients who have had a previous stroke, we work with your stroke neurologist to determine if you are a candidate for the procedure. Surgery is performed at our world-class facilities within NYU Langone’s , which includes two floors dedicated to neurosurgical care, including seven operating rooms (ORs) and a neuro-intensive care unit dedicated to neurosurgical recovery. Our “smart” ORs are digitally integrated and are equipped with the most advanced technology to ensure superior neurosurgical outcomes. Continuing Medical Education for Clinicians Join our experts as they discuss diagnosis, treatment, and management of moyamoya disease in this virtual webinar. After surgery, you are cared for by our multidisciplinary neurocritical care and neurosurgery teams that specialize in caring for patients after brain surgery. Most people who have cranial bypass surgery will have significantly reduced their risk for further strokes, and no additional treatment is needed. If rehabilitation is needed to address the effects of previous strokes, the specialists at can develop a treatment plan to help.

At NYU Langone’s Pituitary Center, our experts are leaders in advanced treatment for people with all types of pituitary tumors and disorders. Our doctors treat more than 300 patients each year and care for those with rare and complex pituitary conditions, such as Cushing disease, acromegaly, prolactinoma, cranial pharyngioma, and Rathke cleft cyst. We routinely see patients who have already had surgery elsewhere or have been told by physicians at other centers that their condition cannot be treated. We are also recognized as a center of excellence for the treatment of pituitary disorders by the Pituitary Network Association. We bring together a team that includes neurosurgeons; endocrinologists; otolaryngologists, also known as ear, nose, and throat specialists; neuro-ophthalmologists; radiologists; and pathologists. Our team ensures that people with pituitary conditions get the most effective treatment, using the latest technology and tools. Advanced Care for Pituitary Disorders For most patients, our endocrinologists strive to treat the hormonal changes associated with pituitary diseases through medication management. If surgery is needed, our neurosurgeons use innovative technology to perform fully endoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive technique that helps ensure a rapid recovery. We also offer Gamma Knife radiosurgery to manage small pituitary tumors in people who cannot have surgery or to treat small portions of tumors that are not completely removed after surgery. Our operating rooms are digitally integrated and are equipped with the most advanced technology, including Surgical Theater, a three-dimensional platform for planning and performing surgery, and Brainlab, integrated software for surgical planning, surgical navigation, and data management. NYU Langone is also home to two intraoperative MRI machines, which allow our neurosurgeons to make real-time decisions based on imaging results during surgery and also enable our surgeons to more thoroughly remove pituitary tumors in less time. Advanced intraoperative imaging helps clarify the boundary between normal gland tissue and tumor, which not only improves rates of tumor removal but also reduces the risk of gland dysfunction after surgery. Leaders in Pituitary Disorders Research As leaders in pituitary disorders research, our neurosurgeons and endocrinologists collaborate with neuroradiologists to better refine imaging techniques to find and treat pituitary tumors. To detect microadenomas—tumors less than 1 centimeter in diameter—NYU Langone neuroradiologists have pioneered the use of 2 types of state-of-the-art MRI: golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) and constructive interference in steady state (CISS). Both GRASP and CISS MRI scans offer ultra-high-resolution images and allow our doctors to better detect small, hard-to-find microadenomas and successfully remove them using noninvasive surgical techniques. In addition, neuroradiologists and nuclear medicine physicians combine these MRI sequences with PET scans to find rare ectopic tumors in people who have acromegaly or Cushing disease. Our team also is proud to collaborate with the North American Skull Base Society to conduct research on improving surgical outcomes on a national level. In collaborating with other large academic centers throughout the country, we help to develop the standards for pituitary surgical excellence.

View All Locations (4) 646-501-7200 Experts at the Endoscopic Spine Surgery Program, a part of NYU Langone’s , offer a groundbreaking approach to care of the neck and lower back. Using an endoscope—a narrow tube with a light and high-definition camera on the end—our surgeons can see the inside of the body on a screen in real time, which helps them perform highly precise spine surgery. This ultra-minimally invasive approach requires only one or two small incisions. Your Spine: An Operator’s Manual Everything you need to know about staying nimble and pain-free from our top-ranked spine experts. View the Book The Benefits of Endoscopic Spine Surgery Endoscopic spine surgery allows our surgeons to protect the surrounding tissues and structures of the spine. The surgery is safe and effective, restoring function and relieving pain from conditions such as degenerative disc disease herniated disc This type of surgery is similar to knee or shoulder arthroscopy. It is typically done on an outpatient basis, meaning you can go home the same day. Recovery time, ranging from one to two weeks, is faster than with open surgery, and you can quickly return to your daily activities, improving your quality of life. Our Surgical Expertise Our knowledge of the latest endoscopic treatments reflects NYU Langone’s excellence and innovation in spine surgery. While most endoscopic spine surgeries use a single incision, several of our surgeons specialize in a more advanced procedure—biportal endoscopic surgery—which uses two tiny incisions, less than one centimeter long. This procedure is only available at a few other medical centers in the United States. Biportal endoscopic surgery allows surgeons to use one incision for the endoscope and the other for the surgical instruments. This two-portal approach further improves surgical precision and protects the spine and surrounding tissues. Our Supportive, Team-Based Approach to Care In addition to our surgical expertise, our team of specialists provides you with the support you need as you make important treatment decisions about your spine health. Orthopedic and neurosurgery spine surgeons, rehabilitation doctors, pain management physicians, neurologists, advanced practice providers, and registered nurses work together to listen to your concerns and provide you with personalized care before, during, and after spine surgery. Physical and occupational therapists may also be a part of the care plan. Spine Conditions We Treat Our doctors can help determine whether you are a candidate for endoscopic spine surgery. We typically use this surgery to treat conditions of the lower back or lumbar spine, including these: spinal stenosis radiculopathy, which is pinching of the nerve near the root sciatica, or injury of the sciatic nerve that originates in the lower spine We may also use endoscopic spine surgery for conditions in the neck or cervical spine, such as disc degeneration, spinal stenosis, or a herniated disc. Endoscopic Spine Surgeries We Perform Our doctors may recommend one of the following surgeries as part of your spine care plan: endoscopic microdiscectomy: removes a piece of herniated disc or can relieve pain caused by radiculopathy or sciatica endoscopic laminectomy or decompression: removes a portion of the lamina, which is the bony arch of the vertebra, to treat spinal stenosis endoscopic fusion: connects bones of the spine to stabilize it to treat spondylolisthesis, severe disc degeneration, or herniated disc Our endoscopic spine surgery program leads the way in creating treatment guidelines that ensure the safe and responsible use of new endoscopic techniques for spine surgery. This work enables us to provide the highest quality of care and the best possible outcomes for our patients.
