HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Chapter 1 _______________________________________________________ Policy 1.3: Equal Employment Opportunity Affirmative Action Updated 01/2024; Prior Revision Date 06/2021 Responsible HR Department: Employee & Labor Relations 212 404 3787 Policy: Equal employment opportunity is a fundamental principal at NYU Langone Health, where employment is based upon personal abilities and qualifications without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, transgender status, gender dysphoria, genetic information, marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, familial status, age, national origin, citizenship status, disability, military or veteran status, height, weight or any other protected class as established by law. Equal employment opportunity applies to all policies and procedures relating to recruitment, hiring, compensation, benefits, termination, training, transfers, promotion, tenure, participation in organization sponsored educational, social and recreational programs, and all other terms and conditions of employment. As a government contractor or subcontractor, it is also the policy of NYU Langone to undertake affirmative action in employment to comply with applicable federal, state or local requirements. NYU Langone is committed to equal opportunity and affirmative action in employment. The Senior Director of Employee & Labor Relations has overall responsibility for monitoring equal opportunity compliance and affirmative action programs and for implementing, administering, and reviewing these programs through senior leadership and Human Resources in their functional areas of responsibility. The Senior Director of Employee & Labor Relations’ responsibilities also include monitoring policies and procedures to ensure non discriminatory practices and investigating all equal employment opportunity/affirmative action complaints. Chairs, Administrators, Department Heads, Directors and Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all policies and procedures associated with equal opportunity and affirmative action are adhered to by personnel under their supervision. Any employees with questions or concerns about equal employment opportunities in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of a member of Employee & Labor Relations. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Chapter 1 _______________________________________________________ Key Definitions: Equal Employment Opportunity provides everyone with the same opportunity based on merit and not based on other factors or characteristics.

Recruits, hires, trains and promotes all persons without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital or parental status, age, national origin, disability, citizenship status, military or veteran status, transgender status, gender dysphoria, genetic information, or any other classification protected by applicable federal, state or local law. 2. Make employment decisions consistent with NYU Langone’s equal employment opportunity policy. 3. Ensure that all matters relating to employment decisions, including recruiting, hiring, compensation, benefits, transfers, layoffs, return from layoffs, sponsored training, education, tuition assistance, and social and recreational programs are administered without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, transgender status, gender dysphoria, genetic information, marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, familial status, age, national origin, citizenship status, age, disability, military or veteran status, or any other protected class as established by law.

This is due to the unique radiobiology of prostate adenocarcinoma coupled with innovation in treatment delivery. Long term data continues to emerge demonstrating favorable biochemical control coupled with low normal tissue toxicity. Prostate SBRT is now considered a standard of care option for men with localized prostate cancer. This comprehensive and interactive hands on course is designed to provide Radiation Oncologists, Urologists, Medical Oncologists and Nurses with an overview of the long term data, treatment planning techniques and clinical considerations for optimizing the use of SBRT while minimizing side effects. This course will include didactic lectures, debate and a treatment planning lab workshop that will involve patient contouring and treatment planning considerations. To promote understanding of the intricacies of treatment, an internationally renowned group of physician scientists has been assembled to lead this discussion.Register NowLEARNING / PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVESAt the conclusion of this course, participants should be able to:n Review literature on Prostate SBRTn Explore different scenarios when pelvic nodal irradiation is necessary. n Assess how advanced imaging and genomic testing can be incorporated into treatment. n Address the contemporary necessity of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). n Minimize treatment related toxicity, specifically to the rectum with the use of hydrogel spacers.n Demonstrate the use of treatment planning and contours to enhance therapeutic effects and optimize clinical outcome.n Review techniques to optimize the quality of life of prostate cancer patients. n Review ablative modalities for low burden metastatic prostate cancer.n Discuss treatment options in managing recurrences.n Explore the option of testosterone replacement therapy after prostate cancer treatment. n Explore advanced ultrasound imaging in Radiation Oncology and Urology.n Discuss diversity and inclusivity and the impact on a Radiation Oncology Department.n Explore the future of SBRT for prostate cancer treatment. n Become proficient in fusion biopsy (Urologist)n Become proficient in focal therapy (Urologist)n Become proficient in fiducial marker placement and hydrogel spacer placement (Radiation Oncologist/Urologist)COMPETENCIESThis symposium will address the following ACGME/ABMS competencies:n Patient Care n Medical Knowledgen Systems based practicen IOM Aims for Care (Safe, Timely, Effective, Efficient, Equitable & Patient Centered Care) TARGET AUDIENCEn Radiation Oncologistsn Medical Physicistsn Urologistsn General Surgeonsn Medical Oncologistsn Nursesn Primary Care Physiciansn Radiation TherapistsACCREDITATIONACCME AccreditationNYU Long Island School of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians through 3/31/2023.
