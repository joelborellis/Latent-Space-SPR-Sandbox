Institutional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement Rev. 12/2023 1 At NYU Langone Hospitals, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine and NYU Langone Health (collectively referred to as “NYU Langone”), the core value of diversity is fundamental to our mission to SERVE, to TEACH and to DISCOVER. We celebrate the inclusive excellence that is found in the contribution of diverse identities, interlinked identities (intersectionality), communities and roles that make us a world class institution in our tripartite mission of patient care, education, and research. We strive to be a place where our exceptionally talented faculty, staff and students of all identities can thrive. We believe that a multifaceted community of people working together in a coordinated way, across our tripartite mission, is key to addressing healthcare and health inequities in the communities that we serve. Together, we will use our diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives to excel in innovation and problem solving as we seek to achieve and even redefine excellence. We intentionally foster a learning and work environment of inclusivity, belonging, and respect for all by relying on our pillars: ● Optimizing organizational culture ● Promoting inclusive community ● Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion capacity ● Developing and implementing equity related knowledge For more details about how we elevate diversity, equity, and inclusion internally and in our community, please contact: NYU Langone Health Gbenga Ogedegbe, MD, MPH, Director, Institute for Excellence in Health Equity NYU Langone Health John Ross (JR) Rizzo, MD, MSCI, FACRM, Health System Director, Disability Inclusion NYU Langone Health Molree Williams Lendor, JD, LMSW, Assistant Vice President, NYU Langone Academy and Workplace Culture & Inclusion NYU Grossman School of Medicine Joseph Ravenell, MD, Associate Dean of Diversity and Inclusion NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine Sandy Dorcelus, DO, FACOG, Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Office of Science and Research Marie Bragg, PhD, Director of Diversity Initiatives
