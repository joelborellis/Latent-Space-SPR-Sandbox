Kimmel Pavilion is a new, 830,000 square feet, state of the art healthcare facility, with 11 patient floors, 374 all single bedded rooms, and 30 operating rooms and image guided labs. Integrated technology, thoughtful design, and rooms that provide privacy for patients combine with best in class care to create a true healing environment.Kimmel was designed with sustainability top of mind, and NYU Langone has applied for and received LEED Platinum designation, which signifes the building is resource efficient, uses less energy and water, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable elements of the building include: building materials made from recycled content, efficient usage of storm water runoff, and high tech windows which reduce the energy load and acoustically separate the healing spaces from the city.Recognizing that design greatly impacts patient experience and wellness, Kimmel has been thoughtfully planned out as a healing environment where patients can find comfort and draw inspiration. Because natural spaces help boost people’s moods and have a positive impact on health outcomes, our spaces have been designed to maximize access to light, views and green space through inviting outdoor spaces like courtyards, gardens, and terraces with sweeping views of the East River and the city.NYU Langone Health Kimmel PavilionLEED Points Achieved / Availablereviewed and awarded by USGBCREGIONAL PRIORITY3 / 4LEED PLATINUMSUSTAINABLE SITESWATER EFFICIENCYENERGY & ATMOSPHERE24 / 266 / 1028 / 35MATERIALS & RESOURCESINDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITYINNOVATION IN DESIGN6 / 1412 / 156 / 6REGIONAL PRIORITY3 / 4LEED Points Achieved / Availablereviewed and awarded by USGBCStorage for 90 bicycles Stormwater harvesting for terrace planting irrigation & cooling towerIncreased ventilation ratesAt least open space & is vegetationWell insulated walls and roof reducesair conditioning energy useConcrete structure contains high recycled content and regionally extracted materialsAir change rates vary based onoccupancy confirmation to maintain high indoor air quality and minimize energy use and cooling tower water useHigh performance mechanical systemsTriple silver high performance low e coated glass reduces solar heat gain & room air changesLow flow fixtures achieve overall water savingCommunicating stairs between floors encourage physical activity anda healthy workplace on typical bed floorFurniture & millwork FSC certified woodOpen grid pavers & light colored terrace paversLight colored pavers with an SRI of 80.4 of roof coverage Building Energy SummaryApproximate Building Energy Savings againstASHRAE 90.1 2007 Baseline: Approximate Building Energy Cost Savings againstASHRAE 90.1 2007 Baseline: Energy Use Intensity (EU): 177 kBtu/sf/YrNYU Langone Health Kimmel PavilionChilled water plant & onsite cogeneration system & cooling towers Offsite cogeneration system CHP High performance mechanical systems and enhanced commissioningVegetative green roof systemAutomated parking garage includes preferred parking for carpool vehicles and electric charging stations Triple insulated glass curtain wall reduces exterior noise levelsEnhanced commissioning of mechanical systemsChilled water plant utilizes refrigerants with low global warming potential and ozone depletion potential LEED PLATINUMPatient RoomPatient RoomSUSTAINABLE SITESWATER EFFICIENCYENERGY & ATMOSPHERE24 / 266 / 1028 / 35MATERIALS & RESOURCESINDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITYINNOVATION IN DESIGN6 / 1412 / 156 / 6REGIONAL PRIORITY3 / 4ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES11041371621151483126159 Solar shades mitigate direct sun & glareOccupancy lighting sensorsLow VOC emitting resilient flooringTriple glazed insulated glass reduces exterior noiseRadiant ceiling panels provide perimeter heatingWell daylit interior patient rooms High efficiency electric lighting with daylighting dimmingLow emitting adhesives, sealants, paintsThermally broken & insulated curtain wallPrefabricated headwall & footwall & toilet room Glazing optimized to reduce solar heat gainTask lighting for cccupant controlLow & high temperature chilled water from chiller plantHigh efficiency low flow plumbing fixturesNight time set backsVarious environmental strategies are utilized in the NYU Langone Kimmel Pavilion to increase occupant comfort and reduce energy and potable water usage. External glass incorporates triple silver high performance low e coatings to mitigate solar heat gain while allowing daylight to penetrate the patient and public areas. Solar shades and radiant ceiling panels provide occupant comfort and reduce energy consumption. Triple insulated curtain wall glass helps reduce external noise pollution while maintaining views of the Manhattan skyline. Daylighting sensors in common areas and perimeter patient rooms reduce the electrical loads from lighting. Rain water is collected from the roofs, retained and reused for landscape irrigation and cooling tower systems. The addition of a three megawatt onsite reciprocating engine and a seven megawatt offsite cogeneration plant significantly reduce electrical demands. * Illustrations courtesy of NbbjViews of Manhattan skyline 13111613141111228884455717 Green seal cleaning program18 Increased mechanical ventilation & higher outside air rates18918151519 Decrease peak air change ratesNYU Langone Health Kimmel PavilionIndividual thermal comfort controls202020Air distribution designed with occupant comfort in mind21Not PicturedEnvironmental StrategiesNFirst AvenueEast 30th StreetEast 34th StreetFDR Service RoadLobby and Elevator AdditionAmtrakAmtrakEmergency DepartmentSkirball InstituteAlumni HallOCMEMedical Science BuildingColesSmilowScience BuildingEast Service WingCafeteriaSchwartz Health Care CenterMillhasuer LabsEnergy BuildingKimmel PavilionTischHospitalBulk OxygenSUSTAINABLE SITESWATER EFFICIENCYENERGY & ATMOSPHERE24 / 266 / 1028 / 35MATERIALS & RESOURCESINDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITYINNOVATION IN DESIGN6 / 1412 / 156 / 6REGIONAL PRIORITY3 / 4Bicycle Storage & Changing Rooms Bicycle storage provided for 5. of the project FTE & transient occupents Showers provided for 0. of the project FTEReduce Heat Island Effect Used light colored and open grid roof paving to achieve high SRI values Increased vegetatation throughout the site including roof areas and terracesPublic Transportation Access Project served by four bus lines within 1/4 mile walking distance from siteMaximize Open Lot Space Open space exceeds of project site area and of open space is vegetatedFERRY TERMINALM15M346TO SUBWAY6TO SUBWAYThe NYU Langone Kimmel Pavilion is located on the East Side of Manhattan.

Numerous stores and community services are provided within close proximity. Bicycle storage and showers are provided for employees, faculty and students. Landscaped areas are provided as part of the project site development, including open space and vegetated terraces. All parking is located inside the building which reduces the heat island effect and leaves more site area for vegetation.
