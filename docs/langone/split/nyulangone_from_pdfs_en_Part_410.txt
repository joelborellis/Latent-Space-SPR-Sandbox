This system is designed to provide multiple combinations for the constantly evolving needs of NYU Langone Health. The following chapter specifies how these components combine to create a unified approach for the NYU Langone Health Sign System.5.0.1© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® OVERVIEW52.50 mm(2.067")21.00 mm(0.827")2100.00 mm(6' 10.677")2100.00 mm(6' 10.677")INFONORM® OVERVIEW: THE GRIDThe Infonorm® Grid determines the width and height measurement for every sign in the NYULH Modular System. Infonorm® utilizes the Metric System, however, where possible the US Customary equivalent has been identified. The standard grid unit is 52 1/2 mm (2.067" +/ ) by 21 mm (0.827" +/ ) .Signs may be created up to 2100 mm (82.677" +/ ) by 2100 mm (82.677" +/ ).When required, US standard paper sizes may be specified for use in insert holders. These sign types will not adhere to the Infonorm® Grid, so their use should be limited. This will allow for ease of ordering Infonorm® parts and a consistent design throughout NYULH. 5.0.2© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® OVERVIEWInfonorm® GridIn SessionIn Session8 1/2" x 11"8 1/2" x 11"YYYYYY2YY2YY2Y2YY2.5YY3YSYSTEM OVERVIEW: TYPICAL WIDTHS FOR ROOM SIGNSThe Infonorm® sign system within this chapter has been developed to accommodate as many scenarios as possible, however, if a new sign is required, the existing proportions should used to develop additional signs.NYULH room identification signs are offered in two typical widths 157.50 mm (6 7/16") and 212.90 mm (8 1/2"). Each of these widths has a series of varying heights, designed to accommodate a range of message types (i.e. temporary insert, tactile room numbers, non tactile message) and lengths. Additional elements in these widths are then added to the sign panels to accommodate the user’s need (e.g. insert panels or in session sliders).This diagram shows some of the panel options and elements that make up the current system and may be used to create new signs.5.0.3© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® OVERVIEW157.50 mm width Signs157.50 mm width Elements212.90 mm width Signs212.90 mm width ElementsINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONS: BASE AND COVER PROFILESThree main components make up every Infonorm® sign, the Base Profile, the Cover Profile, and the End Caps. In addition, Infonorm® provides standard insert holders in typical sizes, including 8 1/2" x 11", 8 1/2" x 5 1/2", and 11" x 17". The Base Profile The Base Profile is an extruded aluminum plate with tracks that hold the Cover Profile. Standard extrusion sizes are available up to the grid height 168 mm (6 5/8" +/ ). Sign types with heights greater than 168 mm will require multiple Base Profiles assembled together.Cover Profiles The standard Cover Profile is an extruded aluminum face plate with guides that slide into the Base Profile tracks. Standard extrusion sizes are available up to the grid height 168 mm (6 5/8" +/ ).Thin Cover Profiles are slimmer than the standard Cover Profile and accommodate the application of a thin mil panel over multiple Thin Cover Profiles to make a seamless full height sign. Thin Cover Profiles are also used in all sign types requiring photopolymer or tactile copy. Special Cover ProfilesFrame Profile 001 is used to create the top and bottom frames of non insert panels, well as the frame that separates two panels on the same Base Profile. Frame Profile 1.2 is used for larger sign types to allow for the use of thicker panels and for directories that require thicker acrylic windows. Most sign types within the NYULH system are made with Profile 001 and the Thin Cover Profile.5.0.4© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONSBase ProfileCover ProfileThin Cover Profile Frame Profile 001Frame Profile 1.2Base Profile TracksCover Profile GuidesThin Cover ProfileThin Cover ProfileThin Cover ProfilePhotopolymerPhotopolymerBase ProfileBase ProfileThin Cover ProfileThin Cover ProfileProfile 001Profile 001Profile 001Profile 1.2Profile 1.2Thin mil panelThin mil full height panelInfonorm® Standard InsertINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONS: END CAPS AND SECURITY DEVICESEnd Caps The End Caps are aluminum extrusions which attach to the Base Profile tracks to secure the Cover Profiles in place. Sign Types in this Manual use one of three (3) different End Caps, TE, E10 or Quick Click. The Infonorm® TE Picture Frame End Caps are the typical endcap for most signs in the NYULH system.The Infonorm® E10 10mm End Caps are used for larger signs where thicker frames are required.The Quick Click Endcaps are used for changeable paper insert holders.Security DevicesThe Tamper Resistant Spring Lock will be used in all instances where permanent messages are displayed. These include tactile room numbers, room identification names, etc. In order to access the message panels, a Security Key Tool is required to compress the lock and release the end cap. Coordinate with RED+F for access to this Security Key Tool. The Quick Click Profile and Insert will be used in semi permanent insert requirements. These types include identification signs, regulatory signs, etc. 5.0.5© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONSTE Picture Frame EndcapSpring LockE10 10mm EndcapQuick Click EndcapVisible FrameVisible FrameVisible FrameLocking Notches Locking Notches Security Key Access Security Key Access Spring LockTE Endcap Base ProfileSecurity Key Access MagnetAlignAlignINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONS: INSTALLATIONThe mounting conditions for the signs will vary from site to site and location to location. This will require a variety of mounting components. Wherever possible, all Infonorm® signs should be mounted to existing walls with fully concealed mechanical fasteners, to facilitate future reloca tion by NYU Langone Health. When panel size or weight requires, signs can be mounted with z clips.If the sign is to be mounted to glass, it should be done so with fully concealed VHB adhesive and a back up panel or vinyl should be used to conceal adhesives.For workstation or partial height wall condi tions where mechanical fasteners are not achievable, the sign can be mounted with VHB adhesive.5.0.6© TWO TWELVE | PRINTED MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualINFONORM® SPECIFICATIONSTypical Mechanical FastenerZ Clip Glass ConditionWorkstation Wall ConditionShim Shim Back up panel or vinylWorkstation wallShimMechanical FastenersZ clipsShimExisting wallExisting wallExisting glassMultipurposeSeminar RoomJonathan P.
