IN THE COMMUNITY2023Our Commitment to Nursing ExcellenceTABLE OFContentsMessage from the Dean and CEOMeasuring Our Impact:Community Benefit ContributionsNursing in the CommunityEmergency Care and Injury PreventionHypertension and Community Health WorkersBehavioral Health in the CommunityDental Care in the CommunityCommunity Health and Subsidized CareImpacting HealthBeyond the Hospital WallsMeasuring Our Impact: Access to World Class Care456101214161820224Dear Friends,NYU Langone Health is guided by the belief that all people, no matter their background, where they live, or their ability to pay, deserve world class healthcare. This principle is best reflected by our turnaround of what is now known as NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn in Sunset Park, which was conferred Magnet Recognition® for excellence in nursing from the American Nurses Credentialing Center for the first time. NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn is the only hospital in the borough to achieve this status, considered the gold standard in nursing.Our nurses are fitting representatives of NYU Langone’s role in the community: we combine top ranked skill with passion and dedication to those under our care. That is why this year’s In the Community report focuses on our commitment to nursing excellence. Our nurses’ close and consistent contact with the members of our community allows them to innovate new ways to reach underserved populations and better address the social determinants of health. Beyond providing exceptional care in our hospitals, our nurses provide treatment for patients in their homes, bring much needed care to homeless shelters and schools, and conduct research on how to better serve vulnerable populations in both clinical settings and in the community. Beyond the work of our nurses, this report contains many stories of how we continue to innovate care delivery strategies that meet our patients’ needs. These programs include partnering with community health workers and faith based groups to treat high blood pressure in South Asian and Black communities, bringing behavioral healthcare to underserved populations in Brooklyn, providing dental care to children and families in Queens, and reopening our free, medical student run community health clinic on Long Island. These programs show our commitment to ensuring access to healthcare across the region.Providing superlative care to more members of our community is top of mind for us at NYU Langone, which is why we are continuously expanding services in Brooklyn and Long Island. In Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, we opened the Joseph S. and Diane H. Steinberg Ambulatory Care Center, which includes an Emergency Department, cancer care, pediatric care, outpatient surgeries, and physician practices. In addition, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone opened a new Federally Qualified Health Center in Red Hook, Brooklyn, to provide services in primary care, pediatrics, women’s health, behavioral health, and dental care. On Long Island, we announced an affiliation with Long Island Community Hospital in Patchogue and opened new primary and specialty care practices nearby, making it easier than ever for patients to access quality healthcare close to home. New Yorkers are tough, talented, and compassionate, just like our nurses and other staff. We are proud to be an integral part of the community providing the people of this extraordinary region the best outcomes, including the No. 1 ranking nationally in observed to expected mortality according to Vizient, Inc., and top marks in quality and safety from U.S. News & World Report, the Leapfrog Group, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. From the West Village to the East End, these are just some of the stories of how we provide one standard of high quality care and support the health of our community.Sincerely,Robert I. Grossman, MDDean and CEOMESSAGE FROM THE Dean and CEO5NYU Langone’s total community benefit contribution of $1.4 billion in investment equates to more than of the health system’s total expenditures for our fiscal year September 1, 2021, through August 31, 2022.

These hospitals are recognized for creating and sustaining an environment that promotes the highest level of nursing care, professionalism, and patient outcomes. The Magnet® status is based on a rigorous set of criteria, including leadership, organizational structure, nursing excellence, quality patient care, and innovation.By providing a framework for nursing practice that prioritizes patient safety and satisfaction, the American Nurses Credentialing Center aims to improve patient outcomes and to promote a culture of nursing excellence. Magnet hospitals are known for their high nurse satisfaction and retention rates, as well as their ability to attract top talent in nursing.NURSING IN THE CommunityMagnet Recognitionis achieved by only of hospitals in the nation.NYU Langone Health is the only health system in New York State to earn Magnet Recognition at all inpatient locations.NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklynis the only Hospital in Brooklynto earn Magnet Recognition.7Nurses Play Critical Roles in Patient Care ProgramsA New Program Brings the Hospital to the HomeNYU Langone Hospital­—Long Island’s Home Hospital program offers a subset of patients who would otherwise be hospitalized the option to receive inpatient care at home. Patients with a Medicare health plan who visit the Emergency Department with acute but stable conditions are evaluated by Emergency Department doctors and a nurse for enrollment.NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island tapped into its own physicians and nurses to build the program and manage patient care. A hospitalist meets remotely or in person with each patient daily. Field nurses visit patients at least twice daily to provide the highest quality of hands on care to patients in the comfort of their own home.Nurses Lead Medical Care in Homeless SheltersThe care team at Community Medicine Program—Family Health Centers at NYU Langone provides healthcare to adults through several New York City homeless services locations. Community Medicine clinics are located within 10 residential shelters for people who are experiencing housing issues, transitional living, or homelessness. Care teams at each clinic location include a registered nurse, doctor or nurse practitioner, psychiatric provider, social worker, and care manager.To further advance healthcare accessibility for New York City’s homeless population, the Nurse in Shelter program was created in collaboration with the Department of Homeless Services. The program utilizes dedicated teams of registered nurses and healthcare navigators to conduct screenings on site in shelters without clinics and connect patients to care. In each Nurse in Shelter team, a registered nurse performs initial assessments and a navigator guides patients through the health system. Registered nurses prioritize care based on necessity and refer patients to a higher level of care when needed.Nurse in Shelter teams can offer same day appointments with a nurse practitioner via telehealth appointments using iPads with software equipped for secure video visits. Nurse practitioners, with their advanced training and authority to diagnose and manage diseases, can provide comprehensive primary care, managing both chronic and acute health conditions. Since its inception in September 2021, the Nurse in Shelter program served 750 clients and facilitated 150 telehealth visits across shelters in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx.Acute Hospital Care at HomeHome Hospital at NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island earned approval from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services after the government agency launched the regulatory framework for providing care to patients outside a traditional hospital. The model is a promising opportunity to ease the burden on overstretched hospitals while improving patient outcomes.The Community Medicine Program’s Nurse in Shelter staff members Ted Tudor, a navigator, and nurse Gabriella Barrett, RN, connect with a client at a partnering homeless shelter in the Bronx. In each Nurse in Shelter team, a registered nurse performs initial assessments and a navigator guides patients through the health system.8Nurses Provide Their Expertise in Community SettingsStroke Awareness Education and OutreachNurses at NYU Langone’s Center for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases engage with community members to provide stroke awareness education and outreach at events in partnership with local community based organizations. The center also organizes a number of Community Stroke Health Fairs annually during Stroke Awareness Month in May. At community events in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island, nurses offer blood pressure screenings, stroke risk assessments, and educational information. Career Exploration: Hempstead High School PartnershipThe NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island’s Nurse Manager Council and nurses at the Hempstead High School’s health clinic, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals, have worked to provide students an immersive insight into daily hospital operations to explore a range of health careers, including nursing. Through observational learning and engaging in discussions with active staff members, the partnership serves as an exploratory platform for students to understand the vast career opportunities within healthcare.Injury Prevention OutreachNurses at the Level I Trauma Centers at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn and NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island provide a variety of educational workshops to reduce the risk of common injuries among community members of all ages. Workshops like these are provided at local schools for grades K 5.NURSING IN THE CommunityNirmala Rossan Raghunath, MSN, RN, stroke coordinator, offers blood pressure screenings at a community event in lower Manhattan.Nurses conduct a Teddy Bear Clinic, where bicycle, helmet, and car safety are reviewed. 9Research Led by Nurses Benefits Patient Care and Nursing Professional DevelopmentThe NYU Langone Health Department of Nursing’s Center for Innovations in the Advancement of Care (CIAC) hosts an annual nursing science conference to highlight nursing led research. Kathleen Evanovich Zavotsky, PhD, RN, system senior director of nursing research and program evaluation, and the CIAC team organize the annual conference as an opportunity for NYU Langone nurses to demonstrate their leadership in research, to network, and to learn from each other.Why is it important for nurses to lead research?With the constantly evolving healthcare landscape, nurses arealways pushing the envelope andstaying up to date on best practices to improve patient care.NYU Langone nurses conduct cutting edge research and contribute to developing new knowledge and advancing practice through research, publications, presentations, and other forms of scholarly dissemination.By participating in scholarly activity, nurses enhance their critical thinking and problem solving skills, develop a deeper understanding of healthcare issues, and ultimately improve the overall quality of nursing practice.Three Nursing Research Studies at NYU Langone1. The Nurse Manager Role of Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow: A Qualitative Study in an Academic Health SystemStatus: CompletedResearch Question: What is the evolving role of nurse managers in an academic health system over time?2. A Resilience Building Interprofessional Partnership in an Academic Health System: Museums, Libraries, and Nurses Working TogetherStatus: IRB Approved and in Progress Research Question: What is the impact of museum led workshops, conducted both on site and virtually by educators from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, on the continuing education of nurses?3. The Impact of Social Determinants of Health on Select Hospital Acquired Conditions in the Older Adult Population across the Health System: A Pilot StudyStatus: IRB Approved and Funded by the Daisy FoundationResearch Question: What are the clinical characteristics and social determinants of health that influence hospital acquired pressure injuries or falls in older adults in New York City?10EMERGENCY CARE AND Injury PreventionOlder Adults Receive Specialty, Fast Tracked Trauma Care to Improve OutcomesEmergency Medicine Program Aims to Prevent Head Injuries with Patient EducationBicycle crashes are a leading cause of physical injury to New Yorkers. Patients frequently present to our Emergency Departments after experiencing bicycle accidents, and these patients often need a new helmet because they did not wear one or wore one destroyed during the accident.As an emergency medicine physician and EMS medical director for the system, Reed Caldwell, MD, was inspired to create a head injury prevention initiative for patients who come to our Emergency Departments after being involved in a crash involving a bicycle, e bike, skateboard, rollerblades, or scooter. Patients in these circumstances are provided new helmets, reflective gear, and safety education resources.In Sunset Park and other neighborhoods served by NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, care for the elderly is a growing concern as the population ages. Seniors make up some of the patients admitted to the hospital’s Emergency Department, and falls account for about of their injuries.By designing a clinical protocol for seniors with fall related injuries who come to the Emergency Department, NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn’s Level I Trauma Center has raised the bar for the level of care that seniors receive. The Geriatric Trauma Program’s implementation has resulted in a reduction in time spent waiting in the Emergency Department and improved outcomes for seniors as they recover.Today, when an elderly person arrives in the Emergency Department at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn after a fall, or if they’re suspected of having sustained a head injury or long bone fracture, the patient is elevated to a status of urgency just below that applied to the most severe traumas. Within minutes, an attending physician in emergency medicine and a member of the trauma team are at the patient’s bedside, performing an evaluation and fast tracking lab tests and imaging studies. In the first 12 to 16 hours, a multidisciplinary care plan is in place that involves a physical therapist, a social worker, a dietician, and a pharmacist who ensures that none of the patient’s medications cause drowsiness or dizziness. These supports for seniors with fall injuries add up to improved care outcomes and a better care experience for our patients.The Geriatric Trauma Protocol has cut in half the amount of time that older adults spend in the Emergency Department for trauma care. Every month the Emergency Department and Trauma Services take care of over 100 injured patients over the age of 65.Photo: Joshua Bright11Athletic Trainers Help Student Athletes and Dancers to Prevent and Recover from InjuryNYU Langone’s Rusk Rehabilitation services provide people with high quality care and the recovery resources for a variety of diagnosis and treatment needs. NYU Langone Sports Health and Harkness Center for Dance Injuries athletic trainers (ATs) are healthcare professionals working under the direction of physicians at Rusk Rehabilitation. ATs specialize in the prevention, assessment, emergent care, and treatment of concussion, musculoskeletal, and general medical conditions. ATs provide education, and in the event of an injury, the Sports Health and Harkness Center for Dance Injuries ATs work closely with the athlete, family, coaches, choreographers, and others to ensure a safe return to the sport or performance.NYU Langone Sports Health athletic trainers deliver high quality care for over 1,000 student athletes in NYC and Long Island. In addition, athletic trainers at the Harkness Center for Dance Injuries provide care for dancers and performers across New York City.Comprehensive, Five Story Multispecialty Care Center Opens in Cobble HillThis year, NYU Langone was proud to open the comprehensive Joseph S. and Diane H. Steinberg Ambulatory Care Center, a state of the art facility that offers an off campus, 24 hour Emergency Department, as well as cancer care, outpatient surgeries, and physician practices—across 165,000 square feet and five floors—in Brooklyn’s Cobble Hill. The robust physician practice includes 19 medical and surgical specialties throughout the new building, which also offers an infusion center and radiology and imaging services at the site of the former Long Island College Hospital. The new ambulatory care center enhances the breadth of high quality care NYU Langone offers in the Cobble Hill community and is conveniently located near mass transit.Photo: Rene Perez Photography Rusk Rehabilitation has been named the best rehabilitation programby U.S. News & World Report for more than 25 years.Ranked among Nation’s Best12HYPERTENSION ANDCommunity Health WorkersPatients with High Blood Pressure Who Partnered with Community Health Workers More Likely to Achieve Blood Pressure Control in South Asian CommunityPatients with hypertension paired with a community health worker (CHW) through their primary care practice were more than three and a half times as likely to achieve blood pressurecontrol within six months compared to patients who were not. Research led by Nadia S. Islam, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Population Health and associate director of the Institute for Excellence in Health Equity at NYU Langone, is the first to examine a CHW intervention in primary care practices that specifically serve South Asian Americans.While New York City is home to the country’s largest South Asian population, many have limited English proficiency, are disconnected from the healthcare system, and lack tailoredresources. Working in close partnership with primary care practices serving South Asian patients, the CHWs were uniquely positioned to help patients integrate their physicians’ recommendations into their lives and daily routines.This research suggests that similar CHW interventions could help other underserved immigrant communities experiencing similar disparities. The next phase of Dr. Islam’s research will examine the impact of CHW interventions on underserved patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, and eventually on mental health.Community Health Workers Improve Health OutcomesResearch at NYU Langone Health demonstrates that health interventions led by CHWs result in improvements in health outcomes for participants. Researchers have implemented programs involv ing CHWs to improve blood pressure in commu nity based settings, including barbershops and churches, as well as in partnership with clinics and primary care practices that serve racially and ethnically diverse communities in New York City. CHWs are lay members of a community who usually share ethnicity, language, income level, and/or life experiences with the people they serve. A key component of their success is the CHWs’ ability to adapt evidence based practices to offer culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate health coaching.Other NYU Langone research involving CHWs includes efforts to improve cancer screening and prevention, diabetes prevention and management, and hypertension control in communities beyond New York City.CHWs Mursheda Ahmed and Gulnahar Alam offer culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate health coaching. NYU Langone researchers have implemented programs involving CHWs to improve health outcomes in racially and ethnically diverse communities in New York City.Photo: Department of Population Health13Directed by Gbenga Ogedegbe, MD, MPH, the Institute for Excellence in Health Equity at NYU Langone launched a faith based network to partner with faith leaders and communities to address issues of health inequities in communities of color. The purpose of the network is to bring together faith based leaders and share resources to support faith communities’ spiritual and physical health.Photo: Mike WeymouthFaith Based Intervention Led by Community Health Workers Reduces Hypertension in Black Communities A lifestyle intervention delivered in churches by CHWs led to a significant reduction in blood pressure among AfricanAmericans compared to health education alone. Research led by Gbenga G. Ogedegbe, MD, MPH, professor in theDepartment of Population Health at NYU Langone and director of the Institute for Excellence in Health Equity, showsthat CHWs using a faith based intervention delivered in churches were able to significantly reduce and managehypertension in Black communities.Dr. Ogedegbe and his team found that after six months, participants in the faith based intervention group saw a netreduction of 5.8 millimeters of mercury in systolic blood pressure. According to Dr. Ogedegbe, if sustained over four tofive years, this reduction can reduce heart attacks and strokes by at least .Since the findings of this research study, Dr. Ogedegbe has explored additional opportunities to adapt healthinterventions in faith based settings and to utilize CHWs and other lay health workers. As the director of the Institutefor Excellence in Health Equity at NYU Langone, Dr. Ogedegbe leads partnerships with faith based communities toimprove health across geographic areas served by NYU Langone, including New York City and Long Island.14Innovative Treatment Program for the Underserved in Brooklyn with Serious Mental IllnessWhile the Family Health Centers (FHCs) at NYU Langone outpatient psychiatric clinic has provided traditional psychiatric care to underserved communities in Brooklyn for over 50 years, an innovative treatment program offers a new team based model of care for patients. The EnTRy program, named for Enhanced Treatment and Recovery, was launched with help from a $5 million federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.In the new, evidence based treatment model, patients with serious mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorders, major depression with psychosis, and schizophrenia benefit from coordinated care provided by a team of providers: psychiatrists, a nurse, social workers, patient navigators, a case manager, peer specialists, and team supervisor.To meet patients where they are and maintain contact with patients who are at risk of disengaging from treatment, the EnTRy program at the FHCs at NYU Langone employs unique staff roles as part of the innovative approach, including patient navigators, peer specialists, and a case manager.Patients include those already engaged in care through the FHCs at NYU Langone, as well as patients who sought acute care for mental health needs at the NYU Langone Hospital­—Brooklyn Emergency Department or psychiatric unit. Patient navigators meet patients in the hospital at discharge to offer friendly support, establish trust, facilitate the transition to community treatment, and help ensure continuity of care—often barriers to success for this patient group.BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN THE CommunityUnique Mental Health Staff Roles• Patient navigators, who share cultural and language backgrounds with Sunset Park area residents, visit community members in their homes, escort patients to their appointments, and help them overcome barriers to accessing care.• Peer specialists, who have themselves received treatment for similar mental health issues, receive special training to be part of the care team. Their lived experience is valuable as they engage patients, connect patients to care, help patients feel safe in treatment environments, and encourage patients to stick with services. This is a new role certified by the New York State Office of Mental Health.• The case manager helps patients access resources to address the social determinants of health, including résumé writing and applications for social services, health insurance, food, and housing.Services are based at the Sunset Terrace site of the Family Health Centers in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.The EnTRy program has now served more than 830 patients with individual counseling and psychiatric care. Additional supports have helped patients stay engaged in care and connected patients to other services.15Expanding Medical Education and Psychiatric Care in BrooklynIn July 2022, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone welcomed its inaugural class of psychiatry residents, three newly graduated medical doctors who chose to make a career in psychiatry. They will spend the next four years working at the FHCs at NYU Langone and affiliated hospitals, with a special focus on delivering mental healthcare treatment in community settings. Residents are immersed in the heart of Brooklyn’s Sunset Park, a rich neighborhood home to large immigrant populations where demand for behavioral healthcare far outpaces access.Residents work alongside experienced psychiatrists, nurses,therapists, and community health workers to offer comprehensive mental healthcare treatment. They treat patients in a neighborhood based outpatient clinic in Sunset Park, at schools, virtually via telehealth programs, and on site in several nearby shelters for people experiencing homelessness. The residency also includes traditional hospital rotations in NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn and New York Health+Hospitals/Bellevue, which is affiliated with NYU Grossman School of Medicine.The FHCs at NYU Langone’s new psychiatry residency is made possible by funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration with the express purpose of developing the next generation of leaders in community and public psychiatry. The new residency program aims to increase access to high quality healthcare in Brooklyn by expanding graduate medical education in the community health setting. A 2016 NIH funded study of health training centers found that residents that train in community health centers are more likely to stay working in an underserved community.Prioritizing Mental Health in Pregnancy CareNYU Langone Health is the first academic medical center in New York State to achieve advanced certification in perinatal care, a designation earned by all three hospital campuses that offer obstetric care. The new Joint Commission certification reflects the highest standards in obstetrics care across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island hospitals—home to 15,000 births annually.The advanced certification measures emphasize trauma informed care, social assessments, and mental health. Since trauma informed care is rooted in patient communication, a series of new questions was added within Epic, the institution’s electronic health record system. Among other measures, patients are queried to assess their risk for postpartum depression and other mood disorders and the need for assistance connecting with local mental health services.Psychiatry resident Luan Garcia, MD, speaks at the press conference held at the Sunset Terrace FHC to announce funding for the new psychiatry residency program.Baby Friendly HospitalsNYU Langone’s Tisch Hospital, NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, and NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island are designated Baby Friendly Hospitals, recognizing our dedication to breastfeeding support and mother baby bonding.Advanced certification in perinatal careNYU Langone Health is the first academic medical center in New York State to achieve advanced certification in perinatal care from the Joint Commission, awarded across all three hospital campuses.Recognized for Our Birthing Care16Lynn Gargano, DDS, clinical director of the School Based Dental Health Program, with a first grade student at PS/MS 333 in Far Rockaway, Queens. Through the expansion of the School Based Dental Health Program in Queens, nearly 700 children received dental care this school year.DENTAL CARE IN THECommunity25,000 studentsserved at 59 public schools across New York CityGeneral and pediatric dentists and a hygienist offer the following services:Dental exams, X rays, cleanings, fluoride treatment, dental sealants, fillings, extractions, and emergency dental careSchool Based Dental Health ProgramThe Family Health Centers at NYU Langone’s School Based Dental Health Program offers children access to high quality dental care in 59 public schools across all five boroughs. Annually, the program provides comprehensive dentistry and oral health education for 25,000 students citywide with no out of pocket costs to children and their families. Most recently, the program expanded into Queens with four new sites in the Rockaways and Corona Park.The School Based Dental Health Program meets a particularly pressing need. More than half of the children seen through the FHCs at NYU Langone’s school based clinics have no other access to a dental provider. Screening events held to raise awareness about the new services found that more than one third of children at the Queens schools currently being served had tooth decay. Children with dental pain may miss school, and for many parents, taking time off work to take a child to the dentist, and the cost of care, are potentially daunting challenges.To bring dental care where it is most needed, the FHCs at NYU Langone partners with the New York City Department of Education to target high need schools, using data that includes average neighborhood income and the number of free lunches provided at the school. Another factor for consideration in opening school based dental clinics is access to dental care in the area.The School Based Dental Health Program expansion to Queens includes schools with D75 programs. These programs offer instructional support for school age children with developmental challenges, including autism disorders, emotional disturbances, and disabilities. Expansion of services into D75 programs represents a significant enhancement to the School Based Dental Health Program, given the creation of sustainable pathways to care for children with disabilities.Dental Care Gives Children and Families in Queens Good Reason to Smile17Dental Training Programs for Recent Dental School Graduates Bring Oral Care to Underserved Communities Nationwide NYU Langone Dental Medicine comprises five postdoctoral dental residency programs for dentists providing oral healthcare services to underserved communities inBrooklyn, NY, as well as across the country.NYU Langone Dental Medicine Postdoctoral Residency Programs provide access to dental care in underserved communities while preparing the next generation of dental health professionals. The programs have become a national model in dental education, training more than 400 residents annually in health centers, tribal organizations, and other community service programs across the United States,Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands.NYU Langone Dental Medicine is dedicated and compassionate about correcting healthcare inequalities. Our residents provide care to patients who would otherwise not have access to oral healthcare services.Transitions from Training to PracticeNYU Langone Dental Medicine residents provide dental care at over 100 different affiliate organizations with more than 300 training sites across the United States, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands.NYU Langone Dental Medicine is a workforce pipeline for safety net clinics, with many alumni returning to work in the health centers where they trained. Some accept positions with NYU Langone Dental Medicine immediately following graduation while others return years later.Dental residents at the NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island campus reviewing a patient’s radiographs.From Patient to Resident to FacultyOur dental residents train in six FHC sites inBrooklyn, NY. One of many residents whoreturned to our Brooklyn site was Imran Ahmed, DDS. Dr. Ahmed was a patient of the Sunset Park FHC as a child and also completed the General Practice Residency Program at NYU Langone. He is now the clinical director of dentistry at the Seventh Avenue FHC.18The Family Health Centers at NYU Langone Expands into Red Hook, Brooklyn, to Enhance Access to High Quality HealthcareContinuing its mission to bring top quality, community based healthcare to New Yorkers and reduce health inequities, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone has expanded in Red Hook, Brooklyn, with the opening of a state of the art medical facility and new school based clinic.The team at the new, nearly 4,500 square foot Red Hook FHC provides primary care, pediatrics, women’s health, behavioral health, and dental care services. Support services are also available on site, connecting patients to social and health networks to address food insecurity and offer workforce development opportunities. Lab work and dental imaging are also performed on site. The Red Hook FHC will also provide access to multilingual translation services for patients.In addition to the outpatient care center, the FHCs at NYU Langone will also open a second school based clinic at PS 676 in Red Hook in the coming months. The FHCs at NYU Langone also operates a school based clinic in PS 15 in Red Hook, as well as more than 50 other school based health clinics citywide.In partnership with Red Hook community leaders, the FHCs at NYU Langone participated in a community baby shower hosted by Jacqui Painter, district leader for New York State Assembly District 51. Staff from the FHCs at NYU Langone shared information on services, including primary and specialty care for adults and children, and highlighted the opening of the new site in Red Hook.COMMUNITY HEALTH AND Subsidized CareThe FHCs at NYU Langone provides affordable, quality care primarily in Sunset Park and Flatbush, as well as through schools and shelters citywide. The new FHC site will bring this high quality care to residents of Red Hook, Brooklyn.19A Free Student Run Community Health Clinic Reopens on Long IslandPaused since the start of COVID, the Wellness Initiative Student Run Health (WISH) Clinic reopened in a new space in Hempstead at the beginning of 2023, bringing essential services to uninsured and underinsured patients on Long Island.The WISH Clinic is entirely student run, with a board composed of medical students. Patients at the clinic are seen by medical students in conjunction with attending physicians from the NYU Langone Department of Family Medicine. The medical students also run the clinic’s daily operations, scheduling visits, checking in patients, managing the free pharmacy, and supporting fundraising efforts.The WISH Clinic operates as a partnership between NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island and RotaCare, a free volunteer based health clinic founded by members of the Mineola Garden City Rotary Club. RotaCare provides free liability and malpractice insurance for the program and credential verification for the hospital’s attending physicians and staff who volunteer for the clinic.The WISH Clinic is open once a month on Saturdays and provides primary care and health screenings for uninsured and underinsured patients on Long Island.“The WISH Clinic gives future doctors a chance to participate in every aspect of healthcare delivery and service learning, while also providing a valuable community service to the uninsured people of Nassau County.”Francis Faustino, MD Chair of the Department of Family Medicine at NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island and Clinical Director of the WISH ClinicCouncil Member Alexa Avilés receives a blood pressure screening at a health fair in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Numerous providers attended the event to educate community members about heart health, stroke prevention, and blood pressure awareness.NYU Langone Partners with Local Communities to Promote Health and Well Being During American Heart Month in February, NYU Langone Health partnered with New York City Council Member Alexa Avilés on a Heart Health Fair to offer blood pressure screenings and heart health education to the residents of Sunset Park and surrounding neighborhoods in South Brooklyn. The Heart Health Fair brought together providers and staff from NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, NYU Langone Health Faculty Group Practice, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, the Stamp Out Cancer Brooklyn initiative of the Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone, and a variety of community based organizations. This is one example among dozens of health fairs NYU Langone Health participates in each year to provide health education and share information about services and programs with the communities we serve.20IMPACTING HEALTH Beyond the Hospital WallsNew Online Tool Provides Health Snapshot of All 435 U.S. Congressional Districts Dashboard Data AnalysisThe Congressional District Health Dashboard’s analysis of the congressional district data reveals the following findings about key measures that impact the health of the population.Researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, unveiled the Congressional District Health Dashboard, a new online tool that provides critical health data for all 435 congressional districts and the District of Columbia.The dashboard incorporates 35 key measures of health, such as deaths from cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, along with conditions that affect health, like housing affordability, broadband access, and unemployment.Until now, most of these data were not available at the congressional district level, nor were they compiled in a single location or easily available to the public.The Congressional District Health Dashboard offers users the ability to do the following:• Explore rigorous, nonpartisan data on health, education, poverty, and more by congressional district and compare these findings to state and national averages• Compare the rates of select metrics among different racial and ethnic groups within districts• View any congressional district’s snapshot, with all 35 measures compared to the national average, along with district specific population facts like age and racial and ethnic makeupA first of its kind tool, the Congressional District Health Dashboard equips congressional staff, federal and state advocates, journalists, researchers, and others with data on health and conditions that affect health in every congressional district across the country, fueling constituents’ and policymakers’ efforts to take action and drive change.Deaths from cardiovascular disease are lower in suburban districts at 194 deaths per 100,000, compared to urban and rural districts at 215 and 225 deaths per 100,000, respectively.Rent burden is lowest in rural districts at , and highest in districts along the coastal regions (California, the Northeast, and Florida) and urban congressional districts generally, at .Racial and ethnic disparitiesin low birth weight are observed across districts, with particularly stark disparities in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina. In more than three quarters of the districts in these states, Black newborns are roughly twice as likely to be underweight at birth than White babies, with other racial and ethnic groups falling between.Data shown here is from 2020.
