(a) Explain how the proposed project advances local Prevention Agenda priorities identified by the community in the most recently completed Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP)/Community Service Plan (CSP). Do not submit the CSP. Please be specific in which priority(ies) is/are being addressed. The proposed project does not explicitly advance the local Prevention Agenda priorities that were identified in the most recently completed Community Health Improvement/Community Service Plan, but it does improve access for our patients that require ambulatory surgical procedures. (b) If the Project does not advance the local Prevention Agenda priorities, briefly summarize how you are advancing local Prevention Agenda priorities. We are advancing the local Prevention Agenda priorities by providing residents of Westchester County with easy access to high quality ambulatory orthopedic surgical procedures closer to their homes. They will no longer have to travel to Manhattan for their care. 8. Briefly describe what interventions you are implementing to support local Prevention Agenda goals. One of the Prevention Agenda goals for Westchester County is to promote healthy activity. By providing residents of Westchester County with easy access to orthopedic ambulatory surgeries, we are enhancing their capacity for engaging in healthy activities. They will be able to once again engage in physical activities that they have previously been unable to partake in. 9. Has your organization engaged local community partners in its Prevention Agenda efforts, including the local health department and any local Prevention Agenda coalition? NYU Langone Health reached out to Dr. Sherlita Amler, Commissioner of Health for the Westchester County Department of Health. Dr. Amler indicated that an ambulatory surgery center would be welcomed medical care in Westchester County and particularly in White Plains, as its central location will broaden access for county residents to have surgical procedures closer to home. 10. What data from the Prevention Agenda dashboard and/or other metrics are you using to track progress to advance local Prevention Agenda goals? Dr. Amler highlighted that Westchester County’s large population of older adults would benefit from this facility. She noted that there are several retirement communities in Westchester and residents of those communities, as well as older individuals throughout the county in general, would now be able to receive these services without having to go into Manhattan, which she saw as a real benefit New York State Department of Health Schedule 16B Certificate of Need Application DOH 155 D Schedule 16B 4 (11/2019) 11.
