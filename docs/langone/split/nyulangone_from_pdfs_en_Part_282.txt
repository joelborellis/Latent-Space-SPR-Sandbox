She has gained two pounds over the year. • No other prior medical history, and currently not taking any medications • Initial workup including autoimmune serologies and quantitative immunoglobulin levels were negative. • You check AFB, bacterial and fungal sputum cultures. • She has 2 out 3 cultures positive for MAC. Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine 3 DC 11/24/2019 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine 4 DC 11/24/2019 What’s the next best step in management? A) Start 3 drug antibiotic therapy for MAC B) Initiate airway clearance with nebulized hypertonic saline and a positive expiratory pressure device C) Start antibiotics for MAC and initiate airway clearance D) Closely monitor without initiation of treatment Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine 5 DC 11/24/2019 GOALS OF AIRWAY CLEARANCE Short term goals Long term goals • Provide more effective sputum • Reduce further airway damage by clearance that improves ventilation halting the vicious cycle • Reduce cough and breathlessness • Reduce pulmonary exacerbations • Improve quality of life O’Neill, et al. Respirology, 2019 Division Name or Footer 6 DC 11/24/2019 The vicious cycle and vortex Cole, 1986 Olivier, 2018 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine 7 DC 11/24/2019 Polverino et al. Eur Respir J 2017 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine 8 DC 11/24/2019 • Patients with chronic productive cough or difficulty to expectorate sputum should be taught an airway clearance technique (ACT) by a trained respiratory physiotherapist to perform once or twice daily. • Adult patients with bronchiectasis and impaired exercise capacity should participate in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme and take regular exercise. • Long term mucoactive treatment (≥3 months) in adult patients with bronchiectasis who have difficulty in expectorating sputum and poor quality of life and where standard ACTs have failed to control symptoms should be offered. • We recommend not to offer recombinant human Dnase. Polverino et al. Eur Respir J 2017 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine 9 DC 11/24/2019 • For children and adults with productive cough due to bronchiectasis related to any cause, we suggest that they be taught ACTs by professionals with advanced training in ACTs. • We suggest that the frequency of ACTs should be determined by disease severity and amount of secretions. • We suggest that ACTs are individualized as there are many different techniques. Hill, et al. CHEST, 2018 10 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 • 1826 patients • Non pharmacologic measures were used in of patients. • used flutter or PEP device • Chest percussion and postural drainage were utilized in and of patients, respectively. • Mucoactive agents were used in of patients; of these, used hypertonic saline. • Those with NTM were more likely to use non pharmacologic measures. Akasmit, et al, CHEST, 2017 11 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 Airway Clearance in Non Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis: Analysis from the United States Bronchiectasis Research Registry • Adult patients with productive cough and bronchiectasis, excluding CF and those on antibiotics for NTM • 1320 patients • 66. of subjects utilized airway clearance at baseline. • Subjects were more likely to utilize airway clearance at baseline if they had experienced an exacerbation ( vs , p<0.0001) or hospitalization for pulmonary illness ( vs , p <0.05) in the prior two years. • Of those with at least one year follow up data, of subjects did not utilize airway clearance at follow up. Basavaraj, et al. ATS abstract, 2019 12 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 Why is airway clearance not utilized more often? • Providers may not be prescribing it. • Patients may not perceive a benefit from it. • May become a burden to the patient, limiting compliance. • Research on the efficacy of airway clearance is limited. 13 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 Airway clearance • Improvement in exercise capacity and quality of life (QOL) in patients using an oscillatory device vs. management without chest therapy. (Murray, 2009) • Improved symptoms, pulmonary function, and reduced CRP and sputum neutrophils in HFCWO vs. PEP device. (Nicolini, 2013) • Improvements QOL and Leicester cough questionnaires, and fewer exacerbations, in those that performed ELTGOL (slow expiration with the glottis opened in the lateral position. (Munoz, 2018) 14 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 Airway clearance • General consensus is that no one ACT is superior in terms of clinical outcomes. • Selection of ACT should be based on the patient’s individual characteristics. Mcilwaine, et al. Eur Resp Rev, 2017 15 Division Name or Footer DC 11/24/2019 Mechanical devices Positive expiratory pressure device High frequency chest wall oscillation 16 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 Active cycle of breathing technique 17 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 Manual techniques • Postural drainage • Manual chest therapy • Hydration and humidification • Optimum functionality of mucociliary clearance requires a temperature of 37 °C. • Humidity levels below change the particle size making mucociliary clearance less effective (Williams et al 1996). 18 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 Mucoactive agents 1. Expectorants • Induce discharge or expulsion of mucus from the respiratory tract • Examples include hypertonic saline and guaifenesin. 2. Mucoregulators • Regulate mucous secretion or interfere with the DNA/F actin network. • Examples include carbocisteine and anticholinergic agents. 19 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine 3. Mucolytics • Decrease mucous viscosity • Examples include N acetylcysteine, erdosteine and DNase. 4. Mucokinetics • Increase mucociliary clearance by acting on the cilia. • Examples include bronchodilators and surfactants. O’Neill, et al. Respirology, 2019 DC 11/24/2019 Hypertonic saline • Directly stimulates coughing. • Lowers sputum viscosity, leading to a higher weight of expectorated sputum. • Helps to humidify airways and enhance ciliary function. • Appears to be well tolerated in bronchiectasis patients (Kelly, 2001). 20 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 • 30 patients with non CF bronchiectasis • Randomized to hypertonic saline or placebo (0. normal saline) for 3 months • Excluded patients with pseudomonas • Improvement in SGRQ scores in hypertonic saline vs 0. normal saline Kellet, et al. Respiratory medicine, 2011 21 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 • 40 patients randomized to hypertonic saline or 0. normal saline daily for 12 months • Significant improvements in QoL, FEV1, and reduction in sputum colonization in both groups, no difference between the groups. Nicolson, et al. Respiratory Medicine, 2012 22 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 Pulmonary Rehabilitation • Can help with mucociliary clearance. • Short term improvements in exercise capacity and QOL with a combination of endurance, strength and inspiratory muscle training (Newall, 2005). • May increase time to first exacerbation (Lee, 2014). 23 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 • ACTs appear to be safe for individuals with stable bronchiectasis. • There may be improvement in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function and health related QOL. • The role of these techniques in people with an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unknown. • More data is needed to establish the clinical value of ACTs on patient outcomes, and differences between various ACTs. Lee At, el al. Cochrane database syst rev. 2013. 24 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 The CLEAR trial • A large UK multicenter trial • To determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of hypertonic saline HTS () and carbocisteine for airway clearance versus usual care over 52 weeks in bronchiectasis using a 2×2 factorial randomized open label trial design. • The primary objective is to determine whether HTS () and/or carbocisteine reduce the mean number of exacerbations over 52 weeks post randomization. http://www.nictu.hscni.net/clear trial/ 25 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019 ENAc • An epithelial sodium channel present on cilia that regulates composition of airway surface liquid via sodium resorption. • It is downregulated by functional CFTR and its consequent upregulation in Cystic Fibrosis patients contributes to viscous mucus. • Downregulation of ENaC may be a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing mucus viscosity and improving clearance of lower airway secretions. • ENaC inhibitors are being investigated in the primary ciliary dyskinesia population (NCT02871778). Regan, et al. Respirology, 2018 26 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine DC 11/24/2019http://bronchiectasis.com.au/ 27 DC 11/24/2019 Summary • Airway clearance is an important management strategy in bronchiectasis. • Techniques include positive expiratory pressure devices, HFCWO, breathing techniques, manual chest therapy, mucoactive agents and pulmonary rehabilitation. • Utilization is limited and patient adherence can be poor. • Further research is needed. 28 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine THANK YOU DC 11/24/2019 References • Agent, P.
