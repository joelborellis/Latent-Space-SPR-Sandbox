Sent via email from RED+F Vendor Notice on 09/24/2022 Subject: Requirements Related to COVID 19 Applicable to RED+F Contractors & Service Providers that Function as Extensions of Staff 001 As a healthcare organization that prioritizes quality and safety and to assure the health of our patients, staff, and visitors, NYU Langone Health (NYULH) has instituted the following requirements to help stop the spread of COVID 19. They are applicable to RED+F contractors, service providers, vendors, and consultants that function as extensions of staff (collectively “Contractors/Vendors”) and their subcontractors, sub consultants, and personnel (collectively “personnel”). COVID Vaccinations We have changed the previously announced timeline for compliance with the requirement that all Contractors/Vendors who provide services in or on any premises owned or operated by NYULH or any of its affiliates (NYULH facilities) must be fully vaccinated: In line with the order set by NYS, all Contractors/Vendors and their personnel who provide services in or on any premises owned or operated by NYULH or any of its affiliates are required to be fully vaccinated by October 25 (with their first dose by September 27). Fully vaccinated is defined as 14 days past completion of the vaccine series. Contractors/Vendors are required to maintain records that provide proof that all personnel who provide services in any premises owned or operated by NYULH or any of its affiliates have been fully vaccinated. Upon request, Contractors/Vendors will provide those records to their NYULH Project/Operations/Facilities/or other Manager or Tenant Coordinator (collectively, the “Manager”). Beginning September 27, 2021, all Contractor/Vendor personnel must carry proof of vaccination status and may be asked to show proof of vaccination status at any time in or on NYULH facilities. Proof may be either hard copy or electronic. The only allowable exemption is for medical reasons. Any Contractor with personnel seeking a medical exemption is to provide their Manager with a list of the names of any such personnel. We will provide information about the process for seeking a medical exemption. An exemption request must be approved in advance by NYULH. If an exemption request is approved, the individual must follow NYULH masking requirements and comply with COVID 19 testing requirements as instructed. NYULH will not provide or pay for these tests. Contractors are required to follow our instructions regarding reporting test results. Contractors/Vendors remain responsible for meeting project schedules and deliverables regardless of the vaccination status of their personnel. Positive COVID 19 Test Reporting All Contractors/Vendors must immediately report any worker who tests positive for COVID 19 and has been in or on NYULH facilities in the last 48 hours. The report must include the name of the worker and note the location(s) where the worker has been while on site. The Contractor/Vendor must make the report via email to their NYULH Manager. The Contractor/Vendor will also provide written notice to all of their personnel as well as other Contractors/Vendors whose personnel were likely to have had a workplace exposure, which is defined as having been within 6 feet of an infected person (i.e., confirmed COVID 19 positive) for at least 10 minutes any time during the period starting from 48 hours before symptom onset or positive diagnosis until the time the infected person was isolated. Cleaning/Disinfecting Contractors/Vendors are responsible for following the appropriate CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations for the immediate work area and equipment used by any individual diagnosed with COVID 19 within the previous 24 hours. If common areas such as bathrooms or shared items have already been routinely cleaned and disinfected, there is no need for additional action. If more than 7 days since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. Entrance Screening Contractors/Vendors who wish to access NYULH facilities which have a controlled entrance will be subject to temperature check and symptom assessment. If the individual does not accept the screening protocols, or does not pass the screening tests he/she will not be admitted. For admission to NYULH facilities which do not have a controlled entrance, please coordinate with the NYULH Manager who requested the service prior to arrival for communication of your obligations with respect to our screening requirements. Compliance with Other Applicable Requirements Contractors/Vendors are required to comply with all other applicable federal, state, local, and NYULH requirements related to masking, social distancing, and other measures designed to control the spread of COVID 19.

NYULH Covid 19 isolation and quarantine, testing, return to work and personal protective equipment requirements for contractor personnel Sent via email from RED+F Vendor Notice on 1/14/2022 Ladies and Gentlemen: In light of the highly contagious Covid omicron variant and updated CDC and NYS guidelines, the attached NYULH 1 6 22 memo has been issued. Please speak with the workers about the importance of staying home if they test positive or experience Covid symptoms and complete the required isolation outlined in the memo. With regards to personal protective equipment, contractor personnel working in an active patient care area not behind a smoke tight construction partition are required to wear an N 95 respirator to protect others and themselves. Use of an N 95 respirator requires employer compliance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection Program which includes medical clearance, fit testing and training. N 95 respirators rely on a seal between the respirator and the face. Therefore, workers wearing an N 95 must be clean shaven for them to be effective. In indoor non patient care areas, workers are required to wear a tight fitting mask which covers the nose and mouth at all times. The use of gaiters, bandanas and masks with an exhalation valve (see attached photo) are not acceptable. Paul Schwabacher Senior Vice President Facilities Management
