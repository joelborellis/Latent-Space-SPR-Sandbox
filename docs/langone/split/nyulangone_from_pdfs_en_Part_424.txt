The associated gift value for these opportunities is dependent on the particular location. Contributing factors include whether it is new construction, the overall square footage of the building, visibility, and usage of space.Determination of donor recognition letter size is dependent on gift value, architectural design, and zoning and building code requirements.NOTE1. The NYU Langone name and logo shall be the most prominent sign on the building and in the main lobby. It shall be typically located above the building donor name. 2. Building donor to be recognized in one (1) exterior and one (1) interior location only.3. All other donors to be recognized in one (1) interior location only. 4. Length of donor name not to exceed 30X capital letter height.5. RED+F will make the final determination of the letter size (within each range) in order to ensure it compliments the architectural design.6. NYU Langone Office of Communications Standards dictate that the use of the word “The” before building names is not allowed.7. Donors of named spaces will be recognized by having their full name at their destina tion; Donor names will not be referenced in directional information, including building and elevator directories.8. Elevators will be referred to by building name. In cases where a building is named, only the last name of the donor will be used in elevator references.DONOR NOMENCLATURE STANDARDSNTS1Preferred TypographyNTS2Alternate TypographyJONATHAN AND JANE DONORJONATHAN S.
