Valve Preservation We specialize in preserving aortic valve tissue to ensure longer-lasting valve repair and a return to an active life. Rapid Recovery Most of our patients are out of bed within four hours of open heart surgery and go home within four days. The aorta is the body’s largest and most important artery, supplying blood to the head, neck, arms, chest, and abdominal organs. At NYU Langone’s Aortic Center, our renowned experts bring together decades of expertise to keep your aorta healthy. Our team, which includes cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons, and genetic counselors, offers a complete approach to treating aortic disease. We provide genetic and family screening, medical therapy, specialized imaging surveillance, and the latest approaches to surgery . Our goal is to allow patients to return to a full, active life. Our doctors manage a full array of aortic conditions, including all types of the following: , which is a bulge in the aortic wall , or a life-threatening tear in the aortic wall, which can be caused by an aneurysm in which the aortic valve, the gateway between the largest chamber of the heart and the aorta, stiffens or does not function properly; aortic valve disease includes stenosis, regurgitation, and bicuspid aortic valve disease Other forms of aortic disease that we diagnose and treat include: aortic intramural hematomas, in which blood leaks through the innermost layer of the aortic wall and flows between the inner and outer walls penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers, which cause the formation of plaque that damages the aortic wall connective tissue diseases in which the aorta is sensitive to injury, such as Marfan syndrome , Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Whatever your condition, we offer a personalized care plan that meets your health needs and goals. Comprehensive Work-Up and Expedited Consultations Providers at our Aortic Center offer you a thorough evaluation that includes dedicated aortic disease imaging and visits with our aortic cardiologist, aortic surgeon, and nurse practitioner. We discuss your care options and answer any questions you may have about the treatment process. Aortic aneurysms are often found due to an unrelated procedure or imaging test for patients who do not have any symptoms. Being told you have an aneurysm and need to meet with a surgeon can be overwhelming, so we offer an expedited consultation. At our Aortic Center, we make sure patients are seen within two weeks of referral. We arrange all imaging before your consultation if needed. Experts in Surgery Our cardiothoracic surgeons offer a full array of innovative surgeries for the aorta. These include open procedures, minimally invasive procedures, and a combination of both, known as a hybrid procedure. We are experts at repairing all areas of the aorta to manage aneurysm and offer the latest surgical approaches to treating aortic valve disease. In addition, we offer care to people who were told elsewhere that surgery was not suitable for them. Faster Recovery and Enhanced Rehabilitation Patients we care for get home faster than those who have surgery at other hospitals. The majority of our patients are out of bed within four hours of open heart surgery. We offer enhanced and early physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation to allow patients to recover faster. Surveillance Monitoring When you come to the Aortic Center, we partner with you to provide care after your initial treatment. We work with your cardiologist to build a customized long-term monitoring plan. In addition, we create a schedule for serial imaging scans to monitor your aorta. We also provide guidance on living an active and full lifestyle while also staying safe. Some medications can reduce the risk of a worsening aortic disease. Certain types of aortic dissection may also benefit from medical therapy Genetic Testing Our doctors offer comprehensive evaluations that include genetic testing. Many people are unaware that they have a genetically inherited connective tissue disorder such as Marfan syndrome until they receive testing. If someone is confirmed to have one of these disorders, we adapt our strategy to provide the treatment that is most likely to heal the aneurysm with the least risk of adverse effects. We may also recommend genetic screening for immediate family members. Leaders in Aneurysm Research NYU Langone continues to lead the way in research to find the best treatment for aortic aneurysms, as well as the role growth factors, cellular mechanisms, genetics, and inflammation play in causing aneurysms and other artery diseases.

NYU Langone Experts Perform Complex Aortic Repair Enhancing Vascular Access & Treatment for Vascular Disease Adult ECMO Program We are located at Tisch Hospital and Kimmel Pavilion. Treatment Support When a severe illness or medical procedure affects breathing or heart function, patients might need mechanical circulatory support from medical devices that take over the work of the lungs or heart, allowing them to heal. NYU Langone has received the Platinum Level Center of Excellence Award from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). Mechanical circulatory support, which includes temporary ventricular assist devices , helps the heart circulate blood through the body. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, is a type of mechanical circulatory support device that, in addition to pumping blood, also takes over the work of the lungs. These types of treatments, provided through NYU Langone’s Adult ECMO Program, can last for a few hours or up to a few weeks. Excellence in ECMO and Mechanical Circulatory Support Experts at use mechanical circulatory support devices can be used to treat , heart attack, or acute respiratory failure, often as a temporary therapy before long-term treatment such as a ventricular assist device, ECMO is also used to treat people who have severe, life-threatening COVID-19, and our success rates exceed the national average. In the first two calendar years of the pandemic, our overall survival rate for people on ECMO support was 84 percent. The nationwide average during this time, reported by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, was 48 percent. In recognition of our excellent patient outcomes and survival rates, NYU Langone has received the Platinum Level Center of Excellence Award from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). Specialized Care and Support for Patients and Families Specialized care is provided at by our team of doctors, surgeons, nurses, and perfusionists, the specialists who operate the ECMO machines. Treatment includes surgery to connect mechanical circulatory support devices to blood vessels, as well as ongoing monitoring and care. ECMO care for children is provided through the Pediatric ECMO Program We provide resources to support you and your loved one undergoing treatment, including integrative health programs that promote stress relief, emotional support from our spiritual care team palliative and supportive care to ease the side effects of mechanical circulatory support and ECMO care.

Highly Experienced Surgeons Our team is among the most experienced in New York City, performing over 5,000 repair procedures over the last 40 years. Highly Successful Outcomes We are a Mitral Valve Repair Reference Center, awarded by the American Heart Association for our nearly 100 percent mitral valve repair success rate. Cardiac surgeons at NYU Langone’s Mitral Valve Repair Program are leaders in treating , a condition that can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and, if left untreated, Mitral valve repair reconstructs and reinforces existing parts of the valve so that they close properly. It is safer, has fewer complications, and lasts longer than mitral valve replacement with an artificial or donor valve, which can harden or wear out over time. Dr. Didier F. Loulmet is director of the Robotic Mitral Valve Program. Leaders in Mitral Valve Repair Our surgeons have a nearly 100 percent success rate in using robotically assisted and minimally invasive techniques to repair even the most complex mitral valves. This distinction has earned us recognition as a Mitral Valve Repair Reference Center from the American Heart Association and the Mitral Foundation. Our doctors have performed more than 5,000 mitral valve repair procedures since our program began in 1980, making our surgeons among the most experienced and skilled in the world at mitral valve repair. Both robotically assisted and minimally invasive approaches allow for smaller incisions and a quicker recovery time. People from around the country travel to NYU Langone for minimally invasive and robotic mitral valve repair to treat complex conditions that are often deemed inoperable by other centers. Our long-term clinical follow-up studies have shown that our mitral valve repair techniques restore normal valve function and help our patients achieve lasting symptom relief. As part of NYU Langone’s , we also partner with interventional cardiologists at the , who provide mitral valve repair using MitraClip™. Your doctor helps you decide which mitral valve repair technique is the best treatment for your condition. All of our procedures take place at , which features the latest surgical technology and single-bedded rooms. VIDEO: NYU Langone cardiac surgeons use robotic techniques to treat mitral valve disease. Our doctors are pioneers in robotically assisted mitral valve repair , which requires only five pencil-sized incisions placed between the ribs through the right chest wall. Using robotic instruments and a small camera, your surgeon directs the movements of a surgical robot inside the heart. This allows for a range of motion the human hand is incapable of performing. Our doctors have performed more than 1,000 of these procedures. Robotically assisted mitral valve repair typically involves less blood loss, less pain after surgery, and less chance of infection, and it requires a shorter recovery time than traditional open heart surgery. Most people require only a two- to three-day stay in the hospital, followed by a few weeks of recovery at home. Minimally Invasive Direct Vision Mitral Repair Minimally invasive direct vision mitral valve repair techniques allow our cardiac surgeons to access the heart and valve with only a small incision on the right side of the chest. Miniature surgical tools provide light and magnification that allow the surgeon to repair the valve using direct vision, without the need for X-ray imaging. Our surgeons have used this approach in more than 1,500 mitral valve repair procedures. The average hospital stay is three days, followed by a two- to three-week recovery at home. This technique yields excellent long-term results, with research showing that the repaired valve continues to function well up to 20 years after the initial surgery.

Leaders in Medical and Surgical Care We have treated more than 2,500 people and are the largest and most experienced program in New York. At NYU Langone’s Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program, our heart surgeons and cardiologists are world-renowned leaders in the treatment of people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) , which causes the heart muscle to become thick and stiff, creating obstructions that limit the heart’s ability to pump blood through the body. Our program is led by cardiologist Dr. Mark V. Sherrid and cardiac surgeon Dr. Daniel G. Swistel , who each have more than 40 years of experience and have together treated more than 2,500 people who have HCM. Our team specializes in treatments for people with the most complex and severe forms of HCM. We develop targeted treatment plans that start with finding the right medications to control your symptoms and improve your quality of life, and then move on to surgery when needed. Under the care of our doctors, our patients experience a greatly improved quality of life and can expect to have a normal lifespan. VIDEO: Dr. Mark V. Sherrid, director of NYU Langone's Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program, explains the five-point approach used to diagnosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and create an effective treatment plan. We are innovators in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy surgery . The surgical procedures widely used to treat forms of HCM that involve the mitral valve were developed by Dr. Swistel and are performed regularly by our team. For people with severe disease that does not respond to standard medical and surgical care, we work with the , which is home to the nation’s top Advanced Treatment for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy If it is not treated, HCM can cause and dangerous, irregular heart rhythm, especially during physical exertion. Although infrequent, HCM can lead to ventricular arrhythmia that can cause sudden death. We provide the early diagnosis and targeted symptom management that are vital to managing this condition. Our cardiologists use imaging tests such as electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and to diagnose HCM and understand its impact on the heart. Because HCM can be an inherited condition, we also offer genetic screening, DNA analysis, and counseling for family members who are at increased risk of developing HCM. Treatment for HCM may include medications , surgery, or less invasive treatments, including alcohol septal ablation Innovative Medication Therapy Treatment for HCM includes medications that decrease heart rate and prevent blood clots and abnormal heart rhythms. Dr. Sherrid is an innovator in the use of disopyramide, a medication used to treat obstructive HCM that does not respond to beta blocker therapy. Disopyramide prevents the heart from overcontracting, which occurs in some patients with obstructive HCM. By relaxing the force of each heartbeat, this medication helps to reduce the amount of obstruction and relieve symptoms. For people with nonobstructive HCM, we use other medications including beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics when needed. Our program participates in research into new medications for treatment of obstructive HCM, and select patients might be candidates for these investigational therapies. Septal myectomy is the most common surgery for HCM, and our surgeons have performed more than 600 of these procedures. Septal myectomy reduces obstructions in the heart by thinning the septum, which is the wall between the left and right sides of the heart. For some people with HCM, the heart’s mitral valve is the source of the obstruction. Dr. Swistel specializes in mitral valve treatment for people with HCM, and invented several surgical techniques now used to preserve the mitral valve in people with HCM, including horizontal plication and residual leaflet excision, or ReLex. Both procedures correct complex structural abnormalities in the mitral valve that obstruct blood flow. VIDEO: At NYU Langone's Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program, our team has more than 30 years of experience providing medical and surgical treatment that improves symptoms and reduces the risk of related cardiac disease such as heart failure. In addition, we are one of only two centers in the country that provide surgical treatment for midventricular and apical HCM, which affect different areas of the heart. This procedure reduces a person’s symptoms of heart failure and the need for a future heart transplant. Our team includes cardiac surgeons from the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, who are available to perform a heart transplant when conventional therapies are not adequate to control your symptoms. Minimally Invasive Treatments We also work with electrophysiologists from our , who use cardiac devices such as the implantable cardiac defibrillator and pacemaker to correct irregular heart rhythms. Our electrophysiologists also perform catheter ablation to treat atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. We also work with interventional cardiologists who perform alcohol septal ablation, a minimally invasive procedure that uses highly concentrated alcohol to remove obstructions and improve blood flow. Leaders in HCM Research Our doctors have a long history of participation in research. We participate in clinical trials for medications that relieve symptoms in people with obstructive HCM. Dr. Swistel has led research into novel surgical repairs to the mitral valve for treatment of obstructive HCM. Our research also includes the role of weight loss in HCM treatment, the causes of apical aneurysm in people with HCM, and the role of mitral annular calcification in left ventricular outflow obstruction. Our participation in HCM research allows our patients access to medications and treatments that are not yet widely available. Our cardiologists and heart surgeons are innovators in the treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mark V. Sherrid Daniel G. Swistel Program Surgical Director Joshua A.

Our goal is to individualize care for patients and their families to promote lifelong health and empower them to live their lives to the fullest. As the first program in New York State to be nationally accredited as an Adult Congenital Heart Disease Comprehensive Care Center, we are widely recognized for our commitment and dedication to our patients and our success in providing the highest quality of care to all people with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) We care for people with all forms of ACHD, whether they were diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. Our team partners with experts in the to help people transition to adult treatment. This collaboration allows us to determine the most appropriate treatment path for each person, based on their individual medical history and diagnosis. Expertise in Adult Congenital Heart Disease Treatment We help our patients understand congenital heart disease and its impact on their future cardiac health. There are many types of congenital heart disease, but they all result from defects in the way the heart developed before birth. These abnormalities, which prevent blood from flowing normally through the heart, include atrial and ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, valve regurgitation or stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, Ebstein anomaly, anomalous coronary arteries, anomalous pulmonary veins, transposition of the great arteries, Fontan circulation, and Eisenmenger syndrome. Managing Adult Congenital Heart Disease Our cardiac experts provide ongoing monitoring of congenital heart defects and help manage the risk of long-term complications. Learn About Our Treatment Approach Congenital heart disease can also lead to secondary conditions, including valve disease, arrhythmias, , pulmonary hypertension, and liver disease. For people who need procedures to improve or correct previous interventions, or surgery to treat new complications, we coordinate with NYU Langone’s congenital cardiothoracic surgeons. Treatments for these conditions include that maintain heart rhythm and manage heart failure, catheter-based treatments to repair valves and correct abnormal heart rhythm, implanted devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators, and surgery to repair defects in the heart and its vessels. When these treatments are no longer enough to maintain healthy cardiac function, we work with the team at to prepare you for a successful transplant and recovery. Maintaining Heart Health We encourage anyone treated for heart disease in childhood to schedule a visit with our adult congenital cardiologists. Even if it’s been years since you had surgery and have no current symptoms, you benefit from regular monitoring to prevent future complications. Pregnancy and Congenital Heart Disease People with congenital heart disease should see an adult congenital cardiologist when considering pregnancy or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Pregnancy can present additional risks for those with a congenital heart defect. We partner with experts in maternal–fetal medicine to provide medical guidance and treatment before, during, and after pregnancy. Transitioning to Adult Care Many of our patients come to us through NYU Langone’s Congenital Heart Transition Program , where we help teenagers move to adult care. We understand that you have a long and personal relationship with your pediatric cardiology team, and we work closely with them to understand your treatment plan and consult on future treatment. We also foster the same long-term relationships with our patients, getting to know you personally and providing care that is aligned with your health goals and future plans. Support Programs and Services We know our patients do best when they feel they are part of a community and can benefit from shared experiences. We often connect new patients with established ones for peer mentoring, and also offer support groups, educational seminars, and psychological support.

Ultrasound is a real-time imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to evaluate tissues and organs throughout the body. This type of imaging is known to be safer than because it does not use ionizing radiation. At NYU Langone, our subspecialized expert radiologists offer abdominal ultrasounds of organs including: babies in the womb bowel and appendix female pelvic ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries in a variety of situations, including pain, abnormal bleeding, and irregular menstruation gallbladder kidneys male pelvic ultrasound of the bladder and prostate musculoskeletal ultrasound of soft tissue within and around your joints including muscles, ligaments, and tendons spleen ultrasounds of newborns and children, including evaluations of the abdomen, pelvis, brain, spine, and hips Preparing for an Ultrasound Preparation for your ultrasound depends on the type of exam—our scheduling associate reviews this with you when you schedule your appointment. Some ultrasounds require fasting for several hours before the study. You should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to your exam. Certain exams may require you to wear a gown, which we provide. We have private dressing rooms with lockers for your clothes and valuables, although we suggest you leave your valuables at home if possible. Bring your prescription, insurance card, and any related insurance forms or pre-approvals. Please bring previous imaging study results, such as X-ray, ultrasound, MRI scans, and CT scans, including reports, films, or CD-ROMs, if available and related to your ultrasound examination. When you schedule your appointment, our scheduling associate lets you know how early to arrive. Depending on the type of exam, this may be 30 to 60 minutes before your scheduled appointment. This allows time for registration and to complete all necessary paperwork, forms, and questionnaires. During an Ultrasound Ultrasound examinations are performed by one of our highly trained staff of sonologists or board-certified radiologists at NYU Langone. During the exam, you lie on a table or sit in a chair in one of our dedicated ultrasound rooms. First, a clear gel is applied to the area of interest, which improves the image quality of the study. Then the sonologist places an ultrasound transducer on the area of interest and saves important images. The sonologist often reviews his or her findings with the radiologist, who may do additional imaging to guarantee a complete study. A written report is sent to your referring doctor. Copies of this report should be available at your referring doctor’s office. If fluid was aspirated or a mass was biopsied, the samples are sent to our laboratory for analysis. These results are also sent to your doctor. After an Ultrasound If you are scheduled for a diagnostic study and no needles are used, then you should be able to leave without assistance immediately after the study is completed, and resume your regular daily activities without limitation. If you undergo an interventional or therapeutic ultrasound that entails an injection, aspiration, or biopsy, you are monitored for a short time after the study is completed by one of our nurses. You should be able to leave our department without assistance, although this may vary depending on the procedure you undergo. You should be able to resume your regular daily activities within one to two days. Your final instructions are given to you, including an information sheet with clear directions, at the time of your ultrasound.
