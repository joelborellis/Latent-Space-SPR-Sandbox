For example, telephone counseling found to be effective for Chinese , Korean , and Vietnamese speaking smokers measuring 6 month prolonged abstinence rates.  Patient navigation programs have been shown to be effective. Patient navigator model has been well studied and implemented by the American Cancer Society. For example, an intervention delivered by peer health advocates was able to increase utilization of treatment programs and smoking abstinence among public housing residents.  Financial incentives have been shown to support smoking cessation interventions. Participants who received incentives were more likely to call the Quitline and complete counseling sessions. Incentive receipt was positively associated with self reported quit attempts, self reported quits, or passing cotinine tests of smoking cessation in most programs  Kuiper N, Zhang L, Lee J, et al.

Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children ParentChild+  ParentChild+ (PC+) is a national model that has been shown to reduce the achievement gap between low and middle income children. PC+ is a cost effective approach that impacts school readiness, long term school success, and strengths based parenting, as demonstrated in many studies, including matched comparison group and randomized control group studies. The model is replicated with high fidelity in Sunset Park.  Compared to control groups, PC+ child graduates have: o stronger social emotional and language skills(core school readiness indicators); o higher levels of English proficiency in kindergarten;  ORS Impact (2015), Long Term Academic Outcomes of Participation in the Parent Child Home Program (PCHP) in King County, WA.
