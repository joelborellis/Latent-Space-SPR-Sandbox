The Financial Statements of NYU Langone Hospitals and NYU Langone Health which contain the LICH Credit Group financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 are on file at www.emma.msrb.org. Patient volumes and net operating revenues are subject to seasonal variations caused by several factors, including, but not necessarily limited to, seasonal cycles of illness, climate and weather conditions, vaca­tion patterns of both hospital patients and admitting physicians and other factors relating to the timing of elective hospital procedures. Interim operating results are not necessarily representative of operations for a full year for various reasons, including levels of occupancy and other patient volumes, interest rates, unusual or non recurring items and other seasonal fluctuations. These same considerations apply to all year to year comparisons.BASIS OF PRESENTATIONThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the August 31, 2023 audited financial statements of NYU Langone Health. They do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) con­sidered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.INVESTMENTS AND ASSETS LIMITED AS TO USE Short term investments consist of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Long term investments include donor restricted and unrestricted endowment funds held in a pooled in­vestment portfolio maintained by NYU.Assets limited as to use primarily consist of externally restricted assets held under long term debt agree­ments, assets restricted for deferred retirement benefits, and assets restricted to pay professional liability claims. These assets consist primarily of marketable securities.USE OF ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, including estimated uncollectible accounts receivable for services to patients and the valuation of investments, and liabilities including estimated settlements with third party payors and malpractice insurance liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial state­ments. Estimates also affect the amounts of revenue and expenses reported during the period. There is at least a reasonable possibility that certain estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Actual results could differ from those estimates.NOTE 1:NOTE 2:NOTE 3:NOTE 4:NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT40AUTHORITATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS ADOPTEDIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The previous standard delays the recognition of a credit loss on a finan­cial asset until the loss is probable of occurring. The new standard removes the requirement that a credit loss be probable of occurring for it to be recognized, and requires entities to use historical experience, cur­rent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate their future expected credit losses. The standard is required to be applied using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to net assets, if any, upon adoption. This ASU is effective for NYU Langone Health for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. NYU Langone Health adopted the ASU for fiscal year 2024 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the combined financial statements.RETIREMENT PLANSNYU Langone Health provides pension and similar benefits to its employees through several plans, includ­ing various multiemployer plans for union employees, a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan primarily for eligible nonunion employees of NYU Langone Health and certain of its related organizations, and a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for certain executives. NYU Langone Health also pro­vides pension and similar benefits to certain employees through a defined contribution plan. NYU Lan­gone Health funds the noncontributory defined benefit plans in accordance with the minimum funding requirement of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), plus additional amounts that NYU Langone Health may deem appropriate from time to time. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 required certain changes to the minimum funding requirements, among other provisions, commencing in 2008. Amounts contributed to the defined benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Contributions to union plans are based on union employee gross salary levels or rates required under union contractual arrangements. Contributions to NYU Langone Health’s defined contribution plan are generally determined on base salaries up to the IRS limit.Pension expense included in the statements of operations and changes in net assets for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 totaled $363.2 million.NOTE 5NOTE 6:Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
