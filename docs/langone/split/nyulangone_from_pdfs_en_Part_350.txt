Importance of not starting or using equipment that has been locked out or tagged outNOTE: The Manager or PM shall obtain evidence of control of hazardous energy and lockout/tagout training from the contractor or vendor to perform work. 8.3Other worker training (i.e. lockout/tagout awareness training)All other workers who may be in areas where energy control procedures may be utilized must receive training on this policy’s scope and purpose, general information on energy control procedures and their importance, and the prohibition against removing a lockout/tagout device and attempting to re start, re energize, or operate machinery involved in a lockout/tagout procedure.Safety Policy ManualPolicy No. 167Policy: Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout)Page 17 of 18Revised: 07/01/20228.4Training Frequencya. Training of authorized and affected workers must be provided initially and prior to performing any work that requires use or understanding of lockout/tagout procedures. b. Refresher Training: Retraining is required if a periodic inspection reveals, or a supervisor/manager has reason to believe, that there have been deviations from the application of the energy control procedure or inadequacies in a worker’s knowledge of or use the energy control procedure. Additionally, retraining must be provided for authorized and affected workers whenever there is a:▪Change in job assignment▪Change in machine, equipment, or process that present a new hazard▪Change in the lockout/tagout procedures9.0Out of Service EquipmentEquipment that must be locked out because it is out of service and is not being serviced or maintained is not part of the lockout program. All locks and tags used for out of service equipment shall be different and easily distinguished from the locks and tags identified in the lockout/tagout program. Out of Service equipment monitoring and management shall be the responsibility of the Department Manager/Head to which the equipment is assigned.10.0Contractors/VendorsWhenever contract/vendor personnel are to be engaged in activities covered by the scope and purpose of this program, the Manager or PM contracting and overseeing the vendor (e.g., Facilities, Real Estate, RED+F Design and Construction) shall ensure that they are informed of and comply with the requirements of this program and plan their work including providing an MoP, their written lockout/tagout program and evidence of training for their personnel and any subcontractor personnel.Related NYULH Safety Policies120: Construction Safety Requirements138: Confined Space Entry157: Electrical Safety169: Enterprise Utility and Essential Equipment ShutdownAppendix ALockout Periodic Inspection FormAppendix BLock Removal NoticeAppendix CShift Change Lock Check out FormAppendix DLockout Isolation Procedures ChecklistSafety Policy ManualPolicy No. 167Policy: Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout)Page 18 of 18Revised: 07/01/2022Issue date07/2022ReplacesNew Reviewed byD.

The machine specific procedure must be followed when performing the inspection to ensure it is accurate. This inspection must be performed by an authorized worker other than the one(s) utilizing the energy control procedure being inspected. Equipment Name/ID #Date:Authorized Workers Being InspectedNameSignature1.2.3.4.5.6.PASSY/NSteps for Machine ShutdownNotify affected workers that the machine is about to be shut down and locked out. Shut down the machine using normal stopping procedure (i.e. activate the stop button, etc.).Isolate all energy sources by closing, blanking and blinding, or otherwise turning switches/disconnects to the “OFF” or “CLOSED” position.Apply locks, tags, and/or devices to the energy disconnects for each energy source present.Check that all moving parts have stopped. Relieve or disconnect any residual hazardous energy that could be present.Verify zero energy state. Attempt to restart at all activating controls, start buttons, etc. and return them to the “off” position.Steps for Restoring EnergyCheck for others. Check the area surrounding the shut off unit to assure that no one will be exposed to danger when that machine is started up. Notify all affected workers that locks/tags are going to be removed and the machine is ready for operation.Remove LOTO equipment. Test the machine. Perform any necessary testing of the restored machine to ensure it is in operable condition.Notify management that work is completed and the area has been returned to operational condition.Safety Policy 167, APPENDIX ALOCKOUT PERIODIC INSPECTION FORMEH&S June 29, 2022Is the equipment specific procedure accurate?

These activities may include, but not limited to the removal of fixed guards, equipment or parts lubrication, cleaning or un jamming of machines or equipment and making adjustments or tool changes, where the worker may be exposed to the unexpected energization or start up of the equipment or hazardous release of energy.EnforcementFailure to properly follow lockout/tagout procedures may result in corrective action.SHUTDOWN, LOCK, TAG & TEST PROCEDURE STEPS1Notify WorkersNotify all affected workers that servicing or maintenance is required on a machine or equipment, and that the machine or equipment must be shut down and locked out to perform the servicing or maintenance.2Review Lockout ProcedureThe authorized worker shall review the procedure to identify the type and magnitude of the energy that the machine or equipment utilizes, shall understand the hazards of the energy, and shall know the methods to control the energy.3Perform Machine StopIf the machine or equipment is operating, shut it down by the normal stopping procedure (depress the stop button, open switch, close valve, etc.). Reference machine operating procedure for normal shutdown.4Isolate EnergyFollow the lockout/tagout procedure located on the first page of this procedure.5Lockout EnergyLockout/tagout as required the energy isolating device(s) with assigned individual lock(s) and tag(s). If the lock(s) need to be transferred to another workers, follow the policy procedure for authorized workers transfer.6Dissipate EnergyStored or residual energy (such as that in capacitors, springs, elevated machine members, rotating flywheels, hydraulic systems, as well as air, gas, steam, or water pressure, etc.) must be dissipated or restrained by methods such as grounding, repositioning, blocking, bleeding down, etc.7Attempt RestartEnsure that the equipment is disconnected from the energy sources by first checking that no personnel are exposed, then verify the isolation of the equipment by operating the push button or other normal operating controls or by testing to make certain the equipment will not operate. Caution: Return operating controls to neutral or "off" position after verifying the isolation of the equipment.Safety Policy 167, APPENDIX DLOCKOUT ISOLATION PROCEDURE CHECKLISTEH&S June 29, 2022RETORE TO SERVICE STEPS1Check MachineCheck the machine or equipment and the immediate area around the machine to ensure that non essential items have been removed and that the machine or equipment components are operationally intact.2Check AreaCheck the work area to ensure that all workers have been safely positioned or removed from the area.3Verify MachineVerify that the controls are in neutral, i.e., not in an active or production state where energization will permit the machine to function as intended.4Remove LockoutRemove the locks, tags and lockout devices and reenergize the machine or equipment. In reverse order, follow all of the steps from the procedure found on the previous page.5Notify Workers Notify affected workers that the servicing or maintenance is completed and the machine or equipment is ready for use.
