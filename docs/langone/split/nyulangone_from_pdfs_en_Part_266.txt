patient across the street. This has implications for both delays in the delivery of life saving care to patients and for cost to commercially insured families who will receive a bill for the ambulance needed for transport across the street. “If there is an infusion reaction, we have to get them back to the hospital via an ambulance transfer. I would worry if the patient does have an infusion reaction. Now we will have to call 911 to transport them back to the hospital.” (Staff Member). July 202417 Low Income People The move also allows for expanded evening hours and weekend appointments for infusions, which can provide greater access to all patients and especially benefit people with low incomes who often have less flexible jobs or are unable to take off work without losing income. A staff member explained this impending change: “Being able to expand our hours and the days of the week. Right now our Infusion Center is only open Monday through Friday, 8 to 4. So being able to provide infusions in the evening hours and on the weekends would expand to the community that can only come in evenings and weekends. They would have access to the infusions during the hours that we don't provide right now. That would be great.” (Staff Member). This is also important for those living with chronic diseases and the need for flexibility in their schedules. A staff member discussed how, with the current hours, patients have left the Infusion Center to seek infusion services at other facilities, but the extended hours will alleviate this issue: “Living with a chronic disease, you have flare ups of your disease. So not every day is a day that you can go to work where you feel strong enough to go to work. So they're taking time off for their medical appointments, because medical offices aren't always open on weekends either. And those appointments are often the ones that, you know, people want, that work. So it's tough to get appointments. It would be a very desirable thing for patients to have the weekend and the evening hours. Many of them have told us that and then honestly, we have lost quite a few patients in the Infusion Center and they've gone to other infusion sites that offered the weekend and evening hours. And it was disappointing to hear and we weren't able to accommodate them.” (Staff Member). Given that patients have to travel three days a week and infusions take two to three hours each time, services being available locally also will lower the cost and time burden of travel (via driving or public transportation) for patients, which especially benefits patients with low incomes. An oncology patient discussed how currently it can take between an hour and an hour and a half to drive to an oncology infusion appointment near him. With the expansion opening up the possibility of oncology patients being seen at the Infusion Center, he said: “Having it [Infusion Center access] closer would make a big difference” (Patient). Immigrants One patient noted that there is a large immigrant population around the Center, and with the increase in number of chairs available, she imagines it will make infusion services July 202418 more accessible to immigrant population and any low income populations who do not have the means to travel long distances for infusions. 12. Did any relevant stakeholders, especially those considered medically underserved, not participate in the meaningful engagement portion of the Health Equity Impact Assessment? If so, list. The following medically underserved groups did not participate in the meaningful engagement portion of the HEIA:  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or other than cisgender  Uninsured STEP 3 MITIGATION 1. If the project is implemented, how does the Applicant plan to foster effective communication about the resulting impact(s) to service or care availability to the following: a. People of limited English speaking ability b. People with speech, hearing or visual impairments c. If the Applicant does not have plans to foster effective communication, what does the Independent Entity advise? Information provided by the Applicant indicates that they will communicate its services and care options to the community by utilizing a standard, multi pronged advertising/communication plan. For individuals of limited English speaking ability, the Applicant will translate relevant materials such as marketing flyers, press releases, and in facility signage. There will be signage at the current locations in English and Spanish announcing the move, a letter in English and Spanish will be sent to patients, and Center staff will also be communicating the details of this move at patient appointments well before it takes effect. Current Center staff will also alert patients as they call for appointments and when they are at their appointments in the current Center prior to the move. The Applicant’s advertising/communication plan will also include outreach to specific publications that target individuals who speak a language other than English. The website will be updated with messaging about the move, and there will be social media posts as well. (Note that these are mainly in English.) Regarding individuals who have speech, hearing, or visual impairments, the Applicant uses digital best practices for accessibility that are informed by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2, the industry standard to ensure users with disabilities (such as vision, cognitive/learning, and/or motor disabilities) can access content equitably. July 202419 2. What specific changes are suggested so the project better meets the needs of each medically underserved group (identified above)? Stakeholders had the following specific suggestions for how the project can better meet their needs as they considered the impact of the move: Ensure the new location is communicated clearly A community based representative mentioned that marketing and communication of the move will be critical. Marketing the new services to the community will also be important. For example, the representative explained: “And who is it an opportunity for? And are we identifying people early enough? Are we doing enough to identify people in the early stages of dementia that these chairs will be filled across the board.” (Community based Representative). Ensure scheduling infrastructure is in place to accommodate increased booking Since there will be an expansion of chairs coupled with extended hours of services, it is important that the infrastructure for scheduling can support the capacity of more patients booking appointment times. This should include clearly communicating the extended hours and ensuring it is easy for patients to understand how to book appointments. 3. How can the Applicant engage and consult impacted stakeholders on forthcoming changes to the project? The Independent Entity recommends the Applicant speak with members of the patient population served by the Infusion Center as their insights are invaluable to understanding how best to ensure any changes to the project consider their needs and the impact on the patient experience for members of different medically underserved groups. It would also be beneficial to speak with medical facilities in the area who may refer to the Infusion Center to ensure that any changes to the project are relayed on and inputs are elicited from those who will be sources of future patients for the expanded infusion services. The Independent Entity recommends engaging patients, caregivers, and staff as the project is implemented. Ideally patients should be contacted approximately 3 months after the relocation and expansion takes place. This would allow patients, caregivers, and staff to experience the impacts of the project and provide input on any potential improvements. We propose interviews so the Applicant can get nuanced information about the impact and potential improvements. We also would propose a patient survey at 3 and 6 months to capture perspectives about the extension across the Infusion Center patients and caregivers. 4. How does the project address systemic barriers to equitable access to services or care? If it does not, how can the project be modified? July 202420 The project addresses systemic barriers to equitable access to care by providing services locally. This reduces the dual burdens of lost time and excess travel for infusion patients and their caregivers. Additionally, the expansion and extended hours will improve access to infusion appointments for low income people, who are constrained by the current schedule and may have less flexible jobs or are unable to take time off of work for appointments. STEP 4 MONITORING 1. What are existing mechanisms and measures the Applicant already has in place that can be leveraged to monitor the potential impacts of the project? At the enterprise level, NYU’s Institute for Excellence in Health Equity develops, implements, and disseminates evidence based solutions to advance health equity in clinical care, medical education, and research. The Applicant has developed a health equity impact dashboard and has increased efforts to collect self reported data related to patient demographics in the electronic medical record to facilitate efforts to track the impact of different projects on medically underserved groups. The dashboard specifically includes infusion patients and captures data on all patients, including indicators such as race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity, age, preferred language, financial class grouping, insurance grouping, median household income, and others. The Applicant will leverage this dashboard and data to reveal and address inequities and disparities as it implements the project. 2. What new mechanisms or measures can be created or put in place by the Applicant to ensure that the Applicant addresses the findings of the HEIA? New mechanisms the Applicant might consider implementing include requiring health equity training for staff and adding questions related to health equity to consumer satisfaction surveys. Using the definitions provided by the state, the Applicant can re work their internal dashboards to report changes in metrics for the specific medically underserved groups identified to better align with the way other organizations and NYS are measuring and monitoring outcomes. The Applicant may also consider continuously engaging with patients engaged in this process and community groups to obtain qualitative input about how changes have been received and what improvements could be made. This will help ensure the success of this project and inform future projects of a similar nature. Specifically, for the Infusion Suite, the Applicant uses a dashboard to track volume, infusion type (cancer vs non cancer), disease type, treatment delays, and reasons for delay. This information assists clinical and non clinical personnel to better understand and respond to changes or issues with patient need, volume, and service timeliness. These data can all be assessed by medically underserved groups to reveal improvement needs related to health equity and disparities. July 202421 STEP 5 DISSEMINATION The Applicant is required to publicly post the CON application and the HEIA on its website within one week of acknowledgement by the Department. The Department will also publicly post the CON application and the HEIA through NYSE CON within one week of the filing.

LhotaAug 12, 2024EVP and Vice Dean, CFOJoseph Lhota July 202423 Through the implementation of this project, NYULH aims to enhance the patient experience and ensure patients are receiving the superior care that they deserve. While the HEIA highlighted some potential concerns from stakeholders, NYULH would like to reiterate it is very early in the planning process and is able to give all concerns strong consideration. Maintaining appropriate staffing levels is a key part component of our implementation planning, and NYULH will determine the most effective staffing based on volume trend monitoring and patient care needs. Regarding recruitment, we are proactive in our efforts, continuously filling positions despite industry wide challenges. Our comprehensive recruitment plan will be in place well before the Infusion Center is open to ensure smooth operations. We assess our staffing needs regularly based on patient volume and service demands, and we offer competitive salaries, professional development opportunities, and a supportive work environment to attract and retain top talent. Operations in the new Infusion Center location will mimic and build upon the current operations of the Infusion Suite location within the hospital to promote a straightforward onboarding process. While adverse infusion reactions are relatively rare in occurrence, not all require transfer to a hospital. Most reactions are able to be managed onsite, where the patient recovers, and then is safely discharged home. For the rare occasions when there is a more robust reaction to an infusion treatment, NYULH has hypersensitivity protocols in place for all personnel to expeditiously respond and stabilize the patient. It is imperative to emphasize that the Infusion Center’s location is approximately 500 feet away from the hospital’s entrance.
