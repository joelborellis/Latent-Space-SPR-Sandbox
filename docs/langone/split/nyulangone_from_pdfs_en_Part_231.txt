I think the biggest problem we have right now is access to primary care and I think that is going to be the biggest hurdle that this facility is going to have, that people have problems getting into primary care to be seen and to be referred.Patient 17/27/2024 residents of the project’s service areaNoZoom interviewYesYesyesThoughts on having the ambulatory service in White Plains is gonna be a plus for everyone coming north, coming South, East, West, it'll take the burden and the fare of people going into the city to be in White Plains. It's more relaxed and the same service that we're gonna have, I think it's a plus all around for everything, anything you're gonna do. White Plains is definitely a place to be in.Brittaney Jones AlleyneBroadview at Purchase College Senior Living9 Jul community leadersYesZoom interviewYesYesNoPatient 214 Aug residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesNoPatient 38/14/2024 residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesNoPatient 48/15/2024 residents of the project’s service areaNoZoom interviewYesYesYesFor me, personally, I would love it if there was a surgery center here so that if I. needed surgery down the line, I didn’t have to go to Manhattan, care close to home.Patient 58/16/2024 residents of the project’s service areayesPhone interviewYesYesNoPatient 68/20/2024 residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesYesI think it’s a good idea, but as I said, then you can’t complete the deal in White Plains, it’s not worth it. To me, it’s not worth it. I am very happy that I’m able to see my doctor in White Plains, and he has office hours there once a week, and I can go there, which is great. But the initial if I went there, and then I was told I had to go into Langone in the city. Now fortunately, we can do that. But maybe next year wouldn’t have been able to do that. I would have checked, probably, ahead of time if the whole procedure would be taken care of at White Plains. If I couldn’t, I wouldn’t go there initially at all.Patient 78/21/2024 residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesNoPatient 88/28/2024 residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesYesThe staff from the clerk to the medical staff has all been a pleasant experience.Maria Gbur9/10/2024 public health expertsYesPhone interviewYesYesYesI’m hoping it also has some sports medicine orthopedics that are geared toward sports medicine. That would be helpful in this area.
