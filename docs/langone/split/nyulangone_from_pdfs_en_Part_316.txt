Community Need See “Schedules Required for Each Type of CON” to determine when this form is required. Public Need Summary: Briefly summarize on this schedule why the project is needed. Use additional paper, as necessary. If the following items have been addressed in the project narrative, please cite the relevant section and pages. 1. Identify the relevant service area (e.g., Minor Civil Division(s), Census Tract(s), street boundaries, Zip Code(s), Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) etc.) The relevant service area for this project includes Brooklyn, New York and Queens Counties. 2. Provide a quantitative and qualitative description of the population to be served. Data may include median income, ethnicity, payor mix, etc. of the patients discharged from the PICU reside in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. 2022 Population Aged <20 by County Population Brooklyn 622,216 New York 308,696 Queens 486,360 Total 1,417,272 It is anticipated that 63. of PICU discharges will be Medicaid and it is expected to remain the same percentage for years 1 and 3. 3. Document the current and projected demand for the proposed service in the population you plan to serve. If the proposed service is covered by a DOH need methodology, demonstrate how the proposed service is consistent with it. Currently, there were 541 discharges from the Pedicatric ICU. By 9/1/2027, this is expected to increase to 1,022 and to 1,049 by 9/1/2029 4. (a) Describe how this project responds to and reflects the needs of the residents in the community you propose to serve. NYU Langone Hospitals has an internal transfer team that is available 24/7 to accept transfers from external hospitals for pediatric patients who need a higher level of care. We partner with other hospitals to provide transport services to ensure their pediatric patients have expedient access to the life saving care and services our PICU can provide. Children needing ECMO, chemotherapy, transplant services and other high acuity treatments are transferred directly to us as a regional resource. New York State Department of Health Schedule 16B Certificate of Need Application DOH 155 D Schedule 16B 2 (11/2019) (b) Will the proposed project serve all patients needing care regardless of their ability to pay or the source of payment? If so, please provide such a statement. The proposed project will serve all patients needing care regardless of their ability to pay or the source of the payment. 5. Describe where and how the population to be served currently receives the proposed services. The population served currently receives their intensive care services in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. 6. Describe how the proposed services will be address specific health problems prevalent in the service area, including any special experience, programs or methods that will be implemented to address these health issues. NYU Langone Hospitals has, in recent years, gained approvals for pediatric transplant programs (i.e. heart and liver), which have grown consistently since inception. With a consistently increasing volume of high acuity patients, more PICU beds are needed to accommodate and ensure pediatric patients in the region can access high quality, complex healthcare services, close to home.
