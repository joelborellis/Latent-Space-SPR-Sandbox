The associated gift value for these opportunities is dependent on the particular location. Contributing factors include whether it is new construction, the overall square footage of the building, visibility, and usage of space.Determination of donor recognition letter size is dependent on gift value, architectural design, and zoning and building code requirements.NOTE1. The NYU Langone name and logo shall be the most prominent sign on the building and in the main lobby. It shall be typically located above the building donor name. 2. Building donor to be recognized in one (1) exterior and one (1) interior location only.3. All other donors to be recognized in one (1) interior location only. 4. Length of donor name not to exceed 30X capital letter height.5. RED+F will make the final determination of the letter size (within each range) in order to ensure it compliments the architectural design.6. NYU Langone Office of Communications Standards dictate that the use of the word “The” before building names is not allowed.7. Donors of named spaces will be recognized by having their full name at their destina tion; Donor names will not be referenced in directional information, including building and elevator directories.8. Elevators will be referred to by building name. In cases where a building is named, only the last name of the donor will be used in elevator references.DONOR NOMENCLATURE STANDARDSNTS1Preferred TypographyNTS2Alternate TypographyJONATHAN AND JANE DONORJONATHAN S.

The base map artwork includes symbols that are NOT interactive. And includes labels, such as street labels, that are NOT translated.Some labels on the interactive map differ from the printed map. This is due to the requirement that all destinations are a unique entry in the database to code routing. For instance, Parking/Valet labels are not differentiated on the printed map yet must include the differentiator Kimmel, Main Lobby, etc. on the interactive map. This above rule applies to Gift Shop labels as well.11232222222233Once a data entry is selected, a direction set box appears along with an animated route. A pulsing “you are here” star begins the animation, followed by a dotted line “walking” the route to the destination or specific elevator for the destination. For all destinations on upper floors, the direction set includes which elevator and floor the visitor must go to.Most visitors will not memorize what is viewed on screen. At the bottom of every direction set box, is a button labeled “Email/Text”. All direction sets can be emailed or texted to the user. Phone numbers and email addresses are not stored in the database.260 px7.3.6© LVCK | MARCH 2023 | VERSION 4.0NYU LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualNOTESUX STANDARDSDirection SetUX STANDARDSDIRECTION SETThe direction set “pop up” box is always located to the left of the map.

For example, the direction set pop up box’s default position is not within the allowable ADA height from finished floor for persons in wheelchairs. Once the accessibility button is selected, it turns purple, the “selected state.”The accessibility button selection moves interactive features lower. The direction set pop up box is moved towards the bottom of the screen, base aligning it 40 pixels above the UX bar. This ensures that the “Email/Text” and “Back” buttons are within the ADA height limits.ADA height limits for interactive elements from finished floor is 48 inches (4 foot).
