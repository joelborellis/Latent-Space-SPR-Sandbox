You know it's a need and a medical need, and one that is very, it takes a lot of emotion and a lot of mental stamina to figure out if you will actually move forward to get a transplant. And so it is my belief that they deserve, once they make the decision to get a transplant. They deserve the utmost care. From start to finish, and once they start, you know their recovery journey is never finished. So you know, having a sustainable approach and model for their new organ and for their longevity. I think, is huge. You know, outside of that, it's the medication to keep them alive. So that it is prescribed in a way that allows them to have a happy and healthy life. Outside of fear, for you know, developing another disease. On top of what they're managing, and for a transplant patient and their caregiver or their family. you know to be that support for them to allow medical follow up psychosocial follow up, to be in one place in one day just give them their lives back in in a way that traveling to multiple locations does not.Joy Oppedisano / TRIO Long Island1/18/2024; 1/25/24; 2/15/24community leaderscommunity based organizationyesZoom interviewyesyesI would say is that in order to serve more people, save more lives and make it as comfortable for everyone that is going to get a transplant, has a transplant, or be a support person, a caretaker to a recipient, or someone that's going to receive, or even a donor having a centralized location or having a consolidation of sorts would really be important in helping to save lives. I think that knowing the research that's going into this and having met you, Lynnette, that I know that this is not something that they're considering lightly, and I'm sure that they're going to, and NYU is going to do the best to serve its patients and to save more lives and have them be more comfortable throughout the entire process.Annabel Henry / LiveOnNY1/18/2024community leaderscommunity based organizationyesN/A (see notes)N/A (see notes)nodeclined interviewKervens Louissaint / LiveOnNY1/25/2024community leaderscommunity based organizationyesN/A (see notes)N/A (see notes)nono responseTransplant Support Organization of Staten Island1/25/2024community leaderscommunity based organizationyesN/A (see notes)N/A (see notes)nono responseWilliam Flynn / Transplant Support Organization1/25/2024community leaderscommunity based organizationyesN/A (see notes)N/A (see notes)nodeclined interviewCarolyn Robinson / Transplant Support Organization1/25/2024community leaderscommunity based organizationyesN/A (see notes)N/A (see notes)nodeclined interviewRebecca Hausman / NYU Langone2/1/2024public health expertsyesZoom interviewyesyesI think that, you know, only positive things in terms of coordination of care and access to care and access to providers come from knowing that everything you need is in one centralized location. I think, you know, our biggest goal is to make sure that people know where to go and how to get what they what they need. And I think it would probably be a relief for both the patients and the providers to know that we could offer the patients one location where we could do all of that under one roof.

They did a great job, but the facilities could be upgraded and consolidated to make it easier on patients. And the staff, too. I assume the staff is having to, you know, run between locations as well. And I just think that for a you know, for a top rank place, which it clearly is, you know, based on you know what I've seen of the people who are who are working there. I think they should have you know, top quality facilities as well.So I'm in favor of that. It's a little bit of a hassle and complex to get around to the different places that the different places where you have to have tests, and the fact that there's 2 different offices, both of them on 34th Street, where you can, you might have to go, for you know, clinical visits. I think that just could be made easier. I was able to, you know, I was able to figure it out without too much trouble, so I can't really complain that much about it. I can see how other people might be quite confused. I mean, it confused my wife; I know that. So you know I can see how the fact of a new city, where people have to frequently traveled to, you know, to get the medical care at NYU Langone, [they] might be confused by that.Stephanie Fleury3/1/24residents of the project’s service areaTransplant recipient YesZoom interviewyesyesI think it'll be beneficial for those waiting for a transplant, and for those who are post transplant, so that there is one place to receive, you know, all the information that they have come to expect as well as just be able to receive updates in real time and not have to wait several hours, for you know, for the results, for blood results or for any results from other doctors. They are able to leave just and say, like, OK, I know what my next steps are. This was efficient.Yafa Edery2/29/24residents of the project’s service areaTransplant recipient YesZoom interviewyesyesI do think, as a patient that went from day one with high oxygen and with a wheelchair, and then after I had the lung transplant, I do see other patients in the same condition that I was before. and I feel for them. And I think that the right thing to do for the State is to help people and have everything in one place. Joanne Drenckhahn2/29/24residents of the project’s service areaTransplant recipient NoZoom interviewyesyesTransplant life is difficult. It's very difficult, no matter what, but I think anything that they could possibly do to make it a little bit easier would definitely be a plus, a benefit. Having everything in one location would just make it so much easier it just it really would just make it easier in a difficult situation, making anything easier helps. I am definitely in support of having all the services be located in one area, one building, one floor that way. It would be so much, so much easier as a patient.Celia Brady2/29/24residents of the project’s service areaTransplant recipient YesZoom interviewYesyesI feel that if every office was under in one building, it would be more beneficial to transplant patients to travel, to get to their appointments at a timely manner than to worry about. “Where's the next building?” You know, “How far do I have to travel?” And so forth.Marcia Nesfield2/29/24residents of the project’s service areaTransplant recipient YesZoom interviewYesyesI don't think that it should have an impact if the transplant patient, the specific transplant patients are still going to be seen by their team, the team that they work with from the beginning, and why, I say that you know, to have them all together, but because they are transplant, if you have an appointment with your team, which is the lounge. I will want to get there and then have the heart transplant person meet with me. So if it is that you're still gonna have your team, it's just they’re going to be at the same location. That's fine.Max Hadler2/28/24public health expertsNYC DOHMHYesZoom interviewYesnoDOHMH stated they would send a verbatim statement once vetted, we followed up twice, have not yet received statementEmma Clippinger2/28/24public health expertsNYC DOHMHYesZoom interviewYesnoMica McDonald3/5/24residents of the project’s service areaTransplant recipient NoZoom interviewYesyesI support moving forward with the project.
