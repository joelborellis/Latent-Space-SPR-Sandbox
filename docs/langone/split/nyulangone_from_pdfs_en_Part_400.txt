LANGONE HEALTHWayfinding and Communications Standards ManualTABLE OF CONTENTSINTRODUCTIONPURPOSE OF THIS MANUAL “A world class, patient centered, integrated academic medical center.”To achieve the vision NYU Langone Health, Real Estate Development and Facilities has been growing the institution’s landscape through mergers and capital improvement projects. RED&F’s program of Signage & Wayfinding has taken measures to improve an individual’s journey to these facilities, and ease navigation through its multiple campuses. This Standards Manual further develops and documents the policy, strategy and design standards of the NYU Langone Health Wayfinding and Communications Master Plan. The purpose of the Manual is to provide graphic and technical specifications for the integrated wayfinding and communications system to be consistently implemented throughout the hospital’s facilities. Expected language, design, and placement of the system’s components is imperative to building a trusted and reliable wayfinding and communications system. Both the Master Plan and Standards Manual documents should be referenced by relevant consultants and staff members when implementing the system. This Manual is a living, working document which will evolve and be adapted to the environmental branding and wayfinding communication needs of NYU Langone Health. In conjunction with the Manual, RED+F will be the arbiter of any future revisions, variations, and interpretations on project specific customization of the signage.SCOPE OF THIS MANUAL The integrated system outlined in the Manual includes signage, digital tools, printed communications, and human interactions to improve navigation. It also outlines the framework for the development of the Centralized Database, a single, reliable and dedicated information source that is the foundation of the entire system, and which will enable the integrated system to grow and change, as needed, in real time. CHAPTER 1 This chapter outlines overarching graphic standards that extend to all printed and digital communications, as well as signage, for reference by all users of the Manual. CHAPTER 2 This chapter provides an overview of the overall integrated wayfinding system including the sign type family, digital components, and communications materials. Guidelines for programming sign types are also outlined, for reference by all users of the Manual. CHAPTERS 3 4 Construction intent documentation for all custom exterior and interior sign types are detailed in Chapters 3 and 4 for bidding purposes. Layout examples for signage that has been implemented to date have been included as guidelines for all similar signage at other facilities, for reference by all design consultants. CHAPTER 5 Construction intent documentation for all modular system sign types have been detailed in this chapter for bidding purposes. This chapter includes the majority of the necessary sign types for all facilities. Relevant pages should be pulled for bid purposes for all future projects by RED&F and/or design consultants. Additional sign types required for unique conditions should be based upon the aesthetic outlined in the Manual.CHAPTER 6 Construction intent documentation for all donor sign types have been detailed in this chapter, as well as guidelines for specifying sign types based upon tiered gift values. This chapter should be referenced by Development, RED&F, and all design consultants. CHAPTER 7 This chapter provides an overview of digital wayfinding and regulatory screen functionality and design. UX standards are detailed here, as well as graphic standards for homescreens, maps, and directional layouts. Additionally, this chapter provides outlines of the content management systems developed for each sign type. CHAPTER 8 This chapter provides guidelines for the printed formats of the family of NYU Langone Health maps.CHAPTER 9 Boilerplate technical specifications for signage bidding purposes.APPENDIX Reference documents including symbol vector artwork, full size typography samples, digital signage shop drawings and content management handbooks.

Room numbers will be provided with building prefix, floor number, and room number.Sign layouts should be formatted so that a character space is inserted between the prefix, floor number, and room number. Where a series of room numbers are included on a sign, the prefix and floor number are dropped from the second number and an en dash ( ) is used to separate the numbers, with a character space to either side. Measurements of alpha characters are based on the height of the capital letter “N.” Measure ments of numbers are based on the numeral “1.”Tactile copy should be adjusted to ensure both alpha and numeric characters comply with ADA copy height requirements.
