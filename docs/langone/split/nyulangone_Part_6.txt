more of the following diagnostic tests so that doctors can pinpoint the cause of your condition and develop effective treatment strategies. As a new patient, please bring copies of any previous test results for your surgeon to review. Cerebral Angiogram Some diseases, such aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and vasculitis , affect the blood vessels of the brain. A cerebral angiogram is the gold standard for assessing these conditions. This test involves injecting dye into the blood vessels of the brain and then taking X-rays of these vessels. The patient lies flat on a table and a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin. The catheter is then passed through the arterial system to the head, where the dye can be injected. This is typically a painless procedure. CT Myelogram Some patients with implanted metal devices cannot undergo MRI scanning. In order to assess the spinal cord in these patients, a special type of CT called a CT myelogram can be done. In this test, contrast dye is not injected into the blood, but rather into the cerebrospinal fluid that coats our brain and spinal cord. This injection is done by means of a spinal tap or lumbar tap. Local anesthetic is given prior to the needle being placed in the lower back. CT scans allow surgeons to pinpoint the location of lesions in the brain or spinal cord. It is particularly useful in determining if there is bleeding in the brain, or bony destruction in the spinal column. For this test, you are asked to lie on a comfortable, open-air table while a series of special X-rays are taken. A simple head CT can take less than 30 seconds. Scans of other body parts may take up to 30 minutes. Some tests require that intravenous contrast dye be administered. People with kidney problems, allergies to shellfish, or previous reactions to contrast dye should make certain that their physician is aware of these conditions prior to receiving contrast dye. Nerve Conduction Studies If a person has weakness or twitching in a muscle, an electromyogram, or nerve conduction study, can help to distinguish between problems in muscles, in the nerves that support the muscles, or in the spinal cord itself. A sterile needle is placed into the muscle. From the needle, small electrical signals are recorded when the muscle is contracted and when it is relaxed. This process is repeated for each muscle to be tested. This is similar to acupuncture. Nerve Conduction Velocity Nerve conduction velocity tests assess peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the spinal cord with the muscles. Electrodes are placed over the nerve to be assessed as well as the muscles it stimulates. Small electric shocks are applied at one electrode. Physicians use the time it takes for these electrical pulses to reach the other electrode to determine if a disease of the peripheral nerves is the cause of pain, weakness, or numbness in the muscle. Lumbar Puncture Cerebrospinal fluid bathes and protects our brain and spinal cord. Examining this fluid can be important in determining if an infection or tumor has spread to this part of the body. The fluid is obtained by a lumbar puncture or spinal tap. The patient is placed on his or her side with the knees tucked to the chest in a fetal position. An area in the middle of the low back is numbed with local anesthetic. A needle is then inserted and fluid removed. The procedure generally takes less than a minute or two. In experienced hands, this procedure is minimally painful. While a CT scan is particularly useful for assessing bony anatomy, MRI is best for imaging soft tissues, such as the brain and spinal cord. The MRI works by assessing the alignment of hydrogen atom nuclei in a very powerful magnetic field. The use of a magnet rather than ionizing radiation is another advantage of MRI over CT. However, because of this magnet, people with heart pacemakers and some other implantable devices cannot undergo MRI testing. Additionally, some patients will find that the longer testing period of MRI, sometimes up to one hour, in a small confined space can induce feelings of claustrophobia and anxiety. Patients who are at risk for such feelings can be given appropriate sedating medication prior to the procedure. Neurological Examination The neurological examination is divided into five parts: mental status, cranial nerves, motor function, sensory function, and reflexes. In the mental status exam, you are asked questions designed to assess your level of alertness, orientation, mood, and cognition. The simplest form of this test requires that you state your name, where you are, and the month, year, and date. You may also be asked to follow commands, such as “Touch your right ear with your left index finger,” solve simple arithmetic problems, repeat a phrase, name an object and what it is used for, or write your name. Cranial nerves are responsible for strength and sensation in the head. Special senses, including vision, hearing, smell, and taste, are part of these tests. A light is shone in your eyes to assess pupil reactivity. Your peripheral vision or visual fields as well as visual acuity are assessed. Eye movements are assessed by having you follow the examiner's moving finger without turning your head. Facial muscles are tested by having you close your eyes tightly, raise your eyebrows, and smile widely. You are also asked to stick out your tongue, shrug your shoulders, and turn your head from side to side as part of the cranial nerve test. The motor function examination tests muscle strength. Individual muscles in both the upper and lower extremities on both sides are tested. Motor assessment will often start with the drift test. You will be asked to place your arms outstretched in front of you with your palms facing upward. You will then be told to close your eyes and count to 10 out loud without moving your outstretched arms. This test can often detect subtle weakness on one side of the body. The remainder of motor function testing is completed by having you bend or straighten a joint, such as the elbow, against resistance provided by the examiner. For example, in order to test the triceps muscle in the back of the arm, you will be told to keep your arm straight at the elbow while the examiner attempts to bend it. The sensory function examination tests your sense of touch. You are told to keep your eyes closed while the examiner lightly touches your skin with a safety pin. You are asked whether the sharp or dull end of the pin touched your skin. This can detect lesions in the spinal cord. Another important part of the sensory exam is assessment of proprioception, a measure of how well you can sense your body’s position and movements. Again with your eyes closed, your toe or your finger will be moved either up or down. You will then state which direction your finger was moved in. This ability to determine the relative position of body parts—without looking—can be compromised by certain neurological conditions. To test reflexes, a small rubber hammer is used to check response at the knee, elbow, wrist, and ankle. These reflexes may be exaggerated or absent in certain pathological conditions. Additionally, the bottom of the foot or the fingernail of the middle finger may be stroked to elicit certain abnormal reflexes. Depending on the suspected neurological condition, the examiner may do other tests as well. For example, the examiner may wish to observe you walking or have you slide the heel of one foot up and down the shin of the opposite leg. Shunt Series and Shuntogram A common neurosurgical operation involves the diversion of excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain. Most commonly, a tube called a shunt is tunneled under the skin from the brain to the abdomen. This implantable device generally stays in place for life. Problems with the shunt, including infection, obstruction, or disruption of the tubing, are occasionally encountered. Workup for a shunt problem includes several tests. A CT scan tells doctors how much CSF is in the brain. Excessive CSF can mean that the shunt is not working properly. A shunt series is a simple set of X-rays of the skull, chest, and abdomen that can reveal a break in the tubing. A shuntogram is a more sophisticated study that involves placing a radioactive isotope in the shunt reservoir in the head and measuring the speed with which it moves to the abdomen. Delayed movement of CSF to the abdomen may imply a problem with the shunt. Lastly, a shunt infection may be assessed by sterilely removing some spinal fluid from the shunt reservoir and sending it to the microbiology lab for culture. Swallow Study Certain neurological conditions can impair a person’s ability to swallow. If there is some question as to whether you can safely be allowed to eat, a swallow study can be done. This involves taking X-rays while you eat food and liquids mixed with barium. This test is done under the supervision of a speech pathologist who determines how well you are able to swallow foods of various consistencies. Simple X-rays are often useful in assessing the bones of the skull and spine. X-rays of the spine can be used to evaluate fractures or misalignment. X-rays are also particularly useful in determining the stability of the spine. This is achieved by taking X-rays of the cervical or lumbar spine both in flexion, bent forward at the neck or hips, and extension, straightened at the neck or hips. The surgeon or radiologist looks for abnormal movement of the bones of the spine on these dynamic images. 317 East 34th Street, 8th Floor 855-698-9998 Transplant Institute Heart Transplant Program Kidney Transplant Program Living Kidney Donation Pancreas Transplant Program Pediatric Transplant Surgery Transplant Institute Patient Stories Top Program in New York We are the premier transplant center in New York, performing one of the highest volumes of transplants with top quality outcomes.

Our heart program continues to have the highest patient survival in the nation amongst programs who performed more than 35 transplants a year, and the best one-year patient survival in New York State. Additionally, the heart program also has the fastest transplant rate in the Northeast. In 2023, our heart transplant program performed the highest number of heart transplants in the Northeast. Nader Moazami, MD , surgical director of heart transplantation, brings more than two decades of experience to the NYU Langone Transplant Institute. He has performed more than 1,000 heart transplants. When a Heart Transplant Is Needed People who are candidates for a heart transplant typically have heart failure, and other treatments for it have been unsuccessful. They may experience shortness of breath during very light levels of activity or have severe and frequent chest pain. Doctors at our can help you explore all your treatment options. Some of the most common causes of heart failure include the following conditions: (genetic, hypertrophic, idiopathic, infectious, postpregnancy, postviral, or restrictive) congenital heart defects heart damage caused by a heart attack First, your doctor explores all nontransplant treatment options for heart failure. If those methods are unsuccessful, your doctor may refer you to the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, or you may call us directly to schedule an appointment. Our doctors review your medical records and sometimes order additional cardiac tests, such as right and left heart catheterization, an echocardiogram, or a cardiopulmonary exercise stress test. After any preliminary tests are complete, a doctor meets with you to discuss your medical history and conduct a complete physical exam. If the doctor determines that you’re a suitable candidate for transplant evaluation testing, the transplant nurse coordinator schedules additional tests that begin approximately two weeks after your first visit. In addition to our transplant care for adults, we also care for children through the Pediatric Heart Failure and Transplant Program Heart Transplant Evaluation When you come to NYU Langone for heart transplant evaluation, our team conducts several different types of tests: lab tests not conducted during your first visit a pulmonary function test tests to check for blockages in the carotid arteries in your neck a test to measure blood flow in the veins and arteries of your legs During the evaluation, you also meet with our heart transplant cardiologist and surgeon, as well as a transplant nurse coordinator, dietitian, financial coordinator, pharmacist, and social worker. Throughout this process, our team evaluates whether a heart transplant is the best option for you, and keeps you and your family up to date so that you can make an informed decision. We conduct heart transplant evaluations and provide pre- and post-transplant outpatient care at our Manhattan location and on Long Island at NYU Langone Cardiology Associates—Mineola and in partnership with the Heart Success program at Morristown Medical Center, part of the Atlantic Health System. Bridge to Transplant Therapies For some people, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or a total artificial heart can help maintain or improve your overall health while you wait for a donor heart. These “bridge to transplant” therapies are provided by our transplant surgeons and doctors from NYU Langone’s Heart Failure Advanced Care Center. Left Ventricular Assist Device Before a transplant, our cardiac experts may recommend that you receive an LVAD, a small electric pump that is connected to your heart to help it pump blood. If you are considered ineligible for a heart transplant, our team may recommend using an LVAD as a destination, or lifelong, therapy. The process to qualify for destination therapy is similar to the evaluation process for a heart transplant. Total Artificial Heart A total artificial heart can be another treatment option for people with advanced heart failure. Unlike an LVAD, which supports only the heart’s left ventricle, a total artificial heart replaces both ventricles and takes over all the work of pumping blood to the lungs and then out to the body. The device is connected to a portable external console, which can be used outside of the hospital. Heart Transplant Candidacy If our team determines that a heart transplant is the best treatment option for you, we help you prepare for candidacy. Our transplant nurse coordinator places you on the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) national waiting list. You are then assigned a heart transplant status, which is based on how urgently you need a heart. After you have been placed on the waiting list for a donor heart, you need to be prepared for surgery whenever a heart becomes available. The wait time for a heart varies and depends on your blood type, body size, medical urgency, and other factors. When a suitable heart becomes available, you are admitted to the hospital if you have been waiting at home and prepared for heart transplant surgery. After Heart Transplant Surgery In the months after your transplant, you have frequent checkups with our team. At these checkups, our experts make sure you are doing well, adjust your medications as needed, and monitor you for infections or other complications. After your transplant, you also have heart biopsies—more frequent in the beginning and then gradually less often—so that our team can make sure your new heart is not being rejected. Our team is dedicated to your success and support after your heart transplant. Your care team continues to see you regularly after surgery for as long as needed.

We provide care for children at the When a Kidney Transplant Is Needed People are born with two kidneys, one on each side of the spine. Kidneys are responsible for filtering blood and removing excess fluid and waste products from the body, which then leave the body as urine. Support the Kidney Transplant Program Make a monetary donation to support our work in kidney transplantation. The kidneys also regulate blood pressure, ensure electrolyte and acid–base balance, and aid in the production of new bone tissue and red blood cells. When kidney function is impaired, as in acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease , the kidney can no longer perform these activities. This puts a person at risk for medical complications that can include , swelling, life-threatening electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and bone loss. Kidney disease may progress to the point where dialysis, a treatment that uses a machine to remove fluid and waste from the blood, is needed. While on dialysis or even before dialysis is started, your doctor may recommend a transplant. While you wait for a donor kidney, you have regular appointments at our transplant clinic with our doctors, who collaborate with your referring physician to ensure continuity in your medical care. Forms of Kidney Transplant Kidney donations come from either living donors , who consent to the donation, or from deceased persons, whose families consent to donate the person’s organs. Deceased donors are the most common source of kidneys for transplant. VIDEO: Patient Milissa Rocker Klotz and Dr. Bruce Gelb talk about Milissa’s living donor kidney transplant. In either situation, the organ is removed from the donor and placed into the recipient by our team of highly skilled transplant specialists. Our medical team supervises the recovery of living donors to ensure they can quickly return to an active lifestyle. After transplant, all patients are followed closely in our outpatient transplant clinic. Our doctors are leaders in the field of kidney transplantation. Nicole M. Ali
