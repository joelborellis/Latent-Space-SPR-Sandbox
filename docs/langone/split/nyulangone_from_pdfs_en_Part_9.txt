The NYU Langone Health Art Program and Collection is integrated into the daily life of our organization providing a life affirming, healing and supportive environment for patients, families, caregivers, students, faculty and staff. This is achieved through acquisitions, exhibitions, donations of art and other related visual arts programming. Acquisitions meet overall quality standards with the aim that the art collection appreciates in value over time. 1. Importance of Art in a Healthcare Environment  Over the past decade, art has become an integral component in healthcare environments. As indicated in the State of the Field Report: Arts in Healthcare/2009 survey, nearly half of all healthcare institutions reported having arts in healthcare programs with the majority of these in hospital settings. Studies have shown that these programs improve patients’ overall health outcomes, treatment compliance and quality of life, and foster a positive environment for caregivers that reduces stress and improves workplace satisfaction and employee retention.

Means of Selecting Art  The Design Studio’s Art Group at RED+F identifies and acquires art through gallery visits, studio visits, recommendations as provided by museum curators, art critics and contemporary art historians and Calls to Artists as posted on visual art websites (New York Foundation for the Arts, Public Arts Network, etc.) 3. Capital Construction Projects Many capital construction projects provide excellent opportunities to integrate art into the design of these new facilities.  Emphasis will focus on public spaces with higher visibility resulting in greater impact.  For patient areas, the inclusion and placement of artwork will be a calming distraction.  Placement of artwork will also support wayfinding efforts.  Goal is to create a singular vision and identity throughout an individual project through selection and placement of artwork.  Selection of site specific artwork will involve input from user groups occupying the space.  Art will be selected from a range of artists, from emerging to established.

Architect’s Responsibilities Where art integration is part of the project scope, art selection will be the responsibility of the Design Studio’s Art Group at RED+F. The A/E Team shall assist with identifying locations for art placement in a project including but not limited to the following:  During Design Development, the architect will work with the Art Manager, Project Manager and users to identify potential locations for art.  The A/E Team shall provide drawings sufficient to identify proposed art locations including plans, elevations and perspectives.  The A/E Team will be responsible for keeping any walls that have been identified for artwork integration, free and clear of any and all electrical devices, room and directional signage, or other potentially distracting items. This includes electrical outlets, telephone/data outlets, light switches, thermostats, fire strobes, furniture, etc.  The A/E Team shall ensure the art has proper lighting. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING Real Estate Development and Facilities 174 2023 ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING The architect is required to use RED+F’s assigned room numbers, and provide full design and programming services related to signage and wayfinding. The A/E Team shall follow the NYU Langone Wayfinding and Communications Standards Manual, available on the Real Estate Development and Facilities website at: http://nyulangone.org/vendor information/design guidelines. The manual specifies each signage type approved for use at NYU Langone Health facilities. For off campus projects, the A/E Team shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with any building landlord requirements. 1. Architect’s Responsibilities  The architect shall submit the signed off floor plans to the Space Planning and Management Group at RED+F who shall assign the room numbers. The architect shall insert these room numbers on the drawings. RED+F will not accept any other room numbers shown on the documents.  Confirm the Room Number Prefix (if any) with the Design Studio’s Signage/Wayfinding Group at RED+F. The architect shall use this Room Number Prefix to produce their signage programming documents.  Confirm requirements for code required emergency/egress signage (i.e. stair and elevator fire egress maps and messaging) and health/safety signage (i.e. chemical, laboratory, hazardous material, radiation, etc.) with Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) at RED+F.  Present signage design options to the Signage/Wayfinding Group.  Produce signage programming documents that include location plans and message schedules for review and approval by the Signage/Wayfinding Group.  Review and approve shop drawings. Shop drawings are also to be forwarded to the Signage/Wayfinding Group for their review and approval.  Punchlist installed signage in coordination with Signage/Wayfinding Group.  Final acceptance of the signage in conjunction with the Signage/Wayfinding Group. Architects, or their consultant, shall be responsible for signage/wayfinding on capital projects. Where there is no architect, signage/wayfinding shall be the responsibility of the Signage/Wayfinding Group. The sign design package may be created by the Architect, a pre approved signage consultant or one of the NYU Langone approved signage vendors. If available, SignAgent shall be used to upload and share project documentation with NYULH and the signage fabricator/installer. When used, NYULH shall be granted visibility, access and full ownership permissions to any project documentation managed with SignAgent. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING Real Estate Development and Facilities 175 2023 2. Sign Planning and Programming Process There are five groups of signs comprising the NYU Langone system: identification, directional, informational, regulatory, and pageantry. Before programming a facility’s signs, the complete sign typology (contained within the NYU Langone Wayfinding and Communications Standards Manual) should be understood by the signage programmer. The following outlines a step by step approach for sign planning and programming.  Analysis When planning and programming signs the programmer shall know the architectural layout, be familiar with the day to day operations and activities of the end users within the space and consider the perspective of first time visitors. Whenever possible, it is recommended that the sign programmer(s) meet with end users to review how the facility will function. The programmer should explore various visitor scenarios, and locate wayfinding decision points (both clear and obscure) along arrival and departure routes. Consider the route distances and turns from start to end point. Typical questions to ask: Where are the restricted access areas, and for what reasons? Who are the visitors, and for what purposes? What kind of sign types are needed, and where?  Visualization of the Space The programmer should imagine a “visitor eye view” through the department. The programmer should enhance comprehension of the architectural character of the visitor experience, of walking the hallways, facing impaired sightlines, or seeking visual landmarks. High and low ceiling space should be noted, along with wall position and angle, both on first entry and closer approach. The programmer should visualize the look and feel of the spaces, and identify optimal sign locations for decision points, avoiding obstacles. If possible, the programmer should suggest the architect revisit particular design details to accommodate sign locations. Typical questions to ask: Are doors or walls opaque or transparent? What color is the wall finish behind reception, and how tall? Is there any art or furniture nearby when determining placement of signage? Are there any devices (electrical outlets, light switches, thermostats, fire alarm strobes, etc.) or other signs nearby that should be considered when determining placement of signage (with respect to height, alignment, etc.)?  Programming Documentation & Clarification The programmer should issue documents for sign vendors to produce message layouts and shop drawings. Draft documents should be submitted to the RED+F PM, end user representative, and the Design Studio’s Signage/Wayfinding Group at RED+F for approval and comments. A unique sign number shall designate floor/location ID (if applicable), designation ID and sign type ID. Typical questions to ask: What is the proper name of the facility? Are there any donor recognition signs?
