Any of our front desk staff at CMC can provide information about how to sign up and log in.Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 7beforeyoursurgeryYour Preoperative Appointment 8Preadmission Testing 9Getting Ready for Surgery 10“Countdown to Surgery” Checklist 128 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookYOUR PREOPERATIVE (BEFORE SURGERY) APPOINTMENTThe decision to have surgery is made after a discussion between you and your orthopaedic surgeon. During your preoperative appointment, your orthopaedic surgeon will talk to you about:• Your injury and why you are having surgery• How your surgery is expected to help you• The risks of surgery• Where and when your surgery will be• What other healthcare professionals will be involved in your surgery• Rehabilitation after surgery• You will be informed to schedule an appointment to be fitted for any postoperative bracing.What should I bring to this appointment?:• Any X rays, MRI, ultrasound, etc., and reports showingthe injury• List of medications you take regularly and the dosages(how much)• Medical equipment you use (crutches, wheelchair, etc.)• Insurance card or information• Name and contact information for primary care doctor• Emergency contact informationQuestions to ask your orthopaedic surgeon:What can I expect before and after surgery?How much will I be able to do after surgery?When will I feel back to normal?Will I be in pain during my recovery?Will I need to take medications after surgery?How long will I need physical therapy?How soon after surgery will I be able to return to work?When will I be able to drive after surgery?Your Preoperative Appointment Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 9PREADMISSION TESTING (PAT) Preadmission testing includes a physical examination and a series of tests that need to be done before your surgery. During preadmission testing you will also meet with an anesthesiology staff member to discuss the type of anesthesia you will have. You will be instructed to report to one of two sites for your preadmission testing:1. If your surgery is at the 38th Street OutpatientSurgery Center, your PAT will take place at:Ambulatory Care Center240 East 38th Street (between Second and ThirdAvenues) Mezzanine Level2. If your surgery is at NYU Langone’s Hospital forJoint Diseases, your PAT will take place at:Hospital for Joint Diseases301 East 17th Street, Room #208B (Room #104 onweekends)3 You should plan to be there for two hours. 3 You do not need to fast before testing, unless you are diabetic. If you are a young patient with no prior medical problems, you may not need to come in for preadmission testing. You will be notified prior to your surgery if testing will be needed.Your preadmission testing may include:Lab TestsA lab technician may take a blood sample and/or urine sample. This is to make sure that you don’t have medical problems that could increase your risk of complications during surgery.The blood tests you have will depend on your age and your medical history. Your doctor may ask for:• Complete Blood Count (CBC) This test measures thenumber of red blood cells, white blood cells, and plate­lets in your blood. It is important that all three are at ahealthy level before surgery.• Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) This test makes sure thatelectrolytes, including sodium and potassium, are balancedin your body. Electrolytes are important for your heart andother organs to function normally. It is very importantthat they are within acceptable levels before surgery.• PT/PTT/INR This test measures the ability of your bloodto clot.• Renal Function Some medications, including anesthesiamedications, are processed by your kidneys. This testmakes sure your kidneys are working properly.• Blood Glucose This test makes sure that your bloodsugar levels are within an acceptable range. It is an im­portant test for patients with diabetes.Imaging StudiesIf you haven’t already had imaging studies, you may need to have an X ray, MRI, or ultrasound. If you are older than 50, have a history of lung disease, or are a smoker, you may also need to have a chest X ray to check for lung infections or abnormalities, which can increase the chance of complications with anesthesia.Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG)An EKG (or ECG) helps your doctor see your normal heart rhythm and check for heart disease. Your surgeon will decide whether you need this test based on your age and general health. Preadmission Testing10 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookMEDICAL CLEARANCE FOR SURGERYIn addition to preadmission testing, your surgeon will need to review your medical record, or clearance, from your primary care doctor before surgery. Clearance is a shortened version of your medical record that includes only specific details about your health history that may affect your surgery.Ask your primary care doctor to send a copy of your clearance to your surgeon’s office. Your doctor may request an appointment to see you before giving you medical clearance.If you do not have a primary care doctor, we can arrange for you to be examined by one of our doctors.PAYING FOR SURGERYWe know that medical care can be costly. If you have concerns about your surgery costs and ability to pay, you can contact us for help in managing your account. Please call our billing office at 877.648.2964. Note that certain medical services are billed separately, so you will receive separate bills from: the healthcare facility where your procedure takes place, your surgeon, your anesthesiologist, and the pathologist. If you have questions about a particular bill, please call the phone number noted on the bill. Our billing policy and forms are available on our website at: http://cmc.med.nyu.edu/patients/new patient formsINFORMED CONSENT Before your surgery, your surgeon will discuss informed consent. Informed consent is a process to make sure that you fully understand the details of your surgery. An informed consent discussion includes:• The reasons for your procedure and the expectedbenefits• Alternative treatment options• Possible complications of the surgery• What will happen if there is a complication, or some­thing unexpected is found• The medical professionals who will be present duringthe procedureIf there is something you do not understand, be sure to ask questions. A detailed discussion of the consent form helps ensure that you fully understand the procedure, recovery, and results. It also helps prevent misunderstandings after a procedure.After the discussion, you and the doctor will sign an informed consent form. This is a legal document to confirm that the discussion took place and that you understand the risks and benefits of the procedure. A nurse or other medical professional will review the document with you, witness your signature, and give you an opportunity to ask questions and share your concerns.Getting Ready for SurgeryPreparing for surgery may start several weeks before your scheduled surgery date.Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 11Steps to Improve Your Health: Some tips to follow to get in shape for your upcoming surgery.3 Stop smoking — This is a good idea at any time, but particularly before surgery in order to help reduce the risk of lung problems after surgery and to im­prove healing.3 Reduce or stop drinking alcohol — Similar to smoking, drinking too much alcohol has been shown to increase the risks of surgery. 3 Get plenty of rest — Sleep helps you recover from your surgery and strengthens your immune system.3 Exercise — Exercise increases strength and range of motion of the joints. It also prepares the joint for reha­bilitation (including physical therapy) after surgery. 3 Eat healthy — Eat fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and foods that are rich in whole grains. 3 Lose weight — Weight loss helps reduce stress on the joints after surgery. This is especially important for people who are obese because they have a higher risk of infection after joint surgery and an increased risk of blood loss.3 Physical Therapy — Consider meeting with your physical therapist before your surgery to begin build­ing a relationship. (Keep in mind that physical therapy before your procedure may not be covered by your insurance plan).IMPORTANT NOTE: If you happen to become sick within the weeks or days before your surgery, even with a common cold, please let us know. We may need to reschedule your surgery until you are healthy again. Medications: Which medications should I stop, and which should I continue to take?Your primary care doctor will review your current medi­cation list and tell you which medications to stop before your surgery. Be sure to tell your doctor all the medi­cations that you are taking, including over the counter medications.Medication Instructions Before Your Surgery:14 days before surgery, STOP… NSAIDS: Ibuprofen, Aleve, Motrin, Advil, Mobic7 days before surgery, STOP…Aspirin, Plavix (unless otherwise stated by your sur­geon)*5 days before surgery, STOP…Warfarin (Coumadin)* You may continue to take:Tylenol, narcotic pain medication, glucosamine chondroitin sulfateThe morning of surgery…3 If you use an inhaler, bring it with you.3 Take certain heart medications.*3 Take certain diabetic medications.**Consult your primary care doctor.For medications not listed, please consult your primary care doctor.12 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookONE TO TWO WEEKS BEFORE SURGERY: What else do I need to plan?3 Arrange for a family member or friend to come with you to the hospital the day of your surgery.3 Plan ahead for transportation home or to your hotel on the day of your surgery.3 Adjust your work/social schedule for your expected recovery time.If needed, arrange transportation to your first follow up visit. While taking narcotic pain medication, you will not be allowed to drive.Get your home ready. 3 Arrange to have someone help you around the house when you return home.3 Organize your household — place items you use often in easy to reach places.3 Buy or make individual meals that can be frozen and reheated easily.3 Keep items off the floors and remove small area rugs to reduce the chance of tripping or falling.3 Consider making plans with friends or pet professionals to care for your pets for the first few weeks after you return home. You may have limited ability to care for your pets and they may cause you to trip and fall. 3 Set up a “recovery center” in your home where you will spend most of your recovery time — make sure it has important things, such as phone, laptop computer, TV, wastebasket, books, and medications that you can reach.3 Make sure your shower is safe, with a nonslip shower mat. Have all shower items in an easy to reach place.Set up your physical therapy.3 Decide where you will do your physical therapy (at home or at a physical therapy center) after your surgery. If you will be going to a physical therapy center, arrange for transportation. You will not be able to drive for at least two weeks after the procedure.3 Call the therapist recommended by your surgeon to schedule your first appointment after surgery. Make sure that the therapist knows how to contact your surgeon for instructions about your care.You may want to visit a physical therapist to practice using crutches or learn the exercises you can do before and after surgery. Remember, preoperative (before surgery) physical therapy sessions may not be covered by your insurance.3 Call your insurance company and the hospital or outpatient surgical facility.3 Contact your insurance company to make sure that your surgery is covered. Ask whether you need authorization for the procedure. Find out if you will be responsible for a deductible, coinsurance, or co pay. Keep in mind that you will be billed separately by the healthcare facility, your surgeon, pathologist, and your anesthesiologist. Your insurance plan may have different formulas for deciding cost and payments for these services.A checklist to help you get ready for your surgery.“Countdown to Surgery” ChecklistSports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 13 Collect your medical information.3 Create a list of all the medications and supplements you are taking.3 List any allergies you have to medications, foods, and materials (such as latex or the dye used for some X ray procedures).3 Talk with family members to find out if there is a his­tory of reactions to anesthesia.3 Talk with family members to find out if anyone has had clots or excessive bleeding after surgeries.3 If you do not have an advance directive or living will, consider creating one. It may also be helpful to choose a healthcare proxy. A living will is a legal document that details a person’s desires regarding medical treatment in circumstances in which they are no longer able to express informed consent. Advance directives can give specific instruction should a per­son be unable to communicate with their doctor, such as a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. Resources for creating these documents are available through the American Bar Association (www.americanbar.org) and other organizations. Remember:3 Give your medication list, and allergy list, to the doctor.3 Bring or fill out your advance directive during your preoperative appointment.3 Bring a copy of the advance directive with you the day of surgery.3 Tell your anesthesiologist and your surgeon if you or family members have a history of excessive bleeding, blood clots, or reactions to anesthesia. Stop taking certain medications, if told to by your doctor.3 Remember, your doctor may tell you to stop taking a medication, change the dose, or change to a differ­ent medication. Review the list in the prior section and discuss your medications with your primary care doctor. He or she will tell you which medications are safe to be continued.ONE TO TWO DAYS BEFORE SURGERY: 3 Confirm your surgery. The OR (operating room) scheduling department will call you the evening before your surgery (or Friday if your operation is on Monday). If you are not home someone will leave you a message. You will be notified:3 When to stop having anything to eat or drink (usually 12:00 a.m. [midnight])3 Which medications to take the morning of your surgery3 What time you should plan to come to the hospital If you have not heard from us by 6:00 p.m. the night before your surgery, you can call the surgery information line: Center for Musculoskeletal Care: 212.263.1515 Hospital for Joint Diseases: 212.598.65773 You may eat normally on the day before your surgery, but do not drink alcohol. DO NOT EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING OR CHEW GUM AFTER 12:00 a.m. (MIDNIGHT), unless specifically told otherwise. This is important when having anesthesia. The only exception is if your doctor specifically tells you to take medication with a sip of water.14 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook3 Shower either the night before or the morning of your surgery.3 Review directions to our facilities (see location infor­mation on page 8) and make sure your transportation is all set.3 Pack a bag containing important items (see “What to bring on the day of your surgery” in the following section).THE MORNING OF SURGERY3 You may brush your teeth and rinse out your mouth — try not to swallow any water.3 Wear comfortable, loose fitting clothing that will fit over a brace.3 Wear flat, nonslip, walking or athletic shoes.3 Remove all jewelry, nail polish, and body piercings before coming to the hospital.3 Leave valuables (money, cell phone, etc.) at home or give them to a family member for safekeeping.What to bring on the day of your surgery:1.

Directions and location details are provided in the “Site Information” section. For your safety, please arrange for a responsible adult to:• Come with you on the day of your surgery• Provide transportation home for you after your surgery• Stay with you for at least 24 hours after your surgeryWe will not be able to go ahead with your surgery until these arrangements are all made.Getting HereSports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 17REGISTRATIONWhen you arrive, you will be welcomed by our friendly registration staff members, who will help you fill out any missing paperwork.You will be given a wristband to wear while you are here. Wristbands usually show your name, date of birth, medical record number, and any allergies. A staff member will go over the information with you to make sure that all the information on your wristband is correct and tell the staff if there are any mistakes on it.After you have registered, you will be asked to be seated in the waiting room.PREOPERATIVE HOLDING AREAA nurse or assistant will take you from the waiting room to the preoperative (preop) area, where you will be asked to sit in a chair or lie on a stretcher. The nurse will ask you several basic questions, more than once, about your health history and the procedure you are going to have. The nurse will also review important patient safety information about anesthesia and your surgical procedure.After you have finished answering the questions, you will be asked to remove:• All jewelry• Dentures, retainers, and partial plates• Eyeglasses and contact lenses• Make up and nail polish (best to remove the night before)You will then be provided with a hospital gown and given privacy to change. A nurse will take your personal belongings and keep them in a secure locker. TIP: If you are cold, be sure to ask for a robe or blankets.MEETING YOUR MEDICAL TEAMWhile in the preoperative holding area, you will meet with the medical team that will be with you during your surgery.Anesthesiologist Your anesthesiologist will: • explain the type of anesthesia you will have (see “Types of Anesthesia” on page 18)• explain the possible risks — it is important to let the anesthesiologist know if you or family members have ever had a bad reaction to anesthesia• ask you if you smoke • ask you if you use dentures Orthopaedic SurgeonYour orthopaedic surgeon will want to know how you are feeling and will answer any last minute questions. He or she will mark the limb or joint to be operated on with a marker. If it has not yet been done, your surgeon will review your informed consent with you (see earlier section under “How Should I Plan for Surgery?”).Residents/Fellows/Physician Assistants (PAs)You will be introduced to any residents, fellows, physician assistants or doctors who may be helping during your surgery.Operating Room NurseThe operating room nurse will visit you to check your identification and make sure that you are ready for surgery.What Happens Once I Arrive?18 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookPREPARING FOR THE OPERATING ROOMA preoperative nurse will check your vital signs, including your temperature, heart rate, respiratory (breathing) rate, and blood pressure. An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in your arm so that you can receive fluids, anesthesia, and antibiotics throughout the surgery. This will be removed before you leave the hospital. To make sure the operating room remains a sterile environment, each member of your medical team will put on a facemask and cap before leaving the preoperative area or before entering the operating room. A cap will be placed on your head as well. Once you are ready for surgery, you will be brought to the operating room on a stretcher. Once you are in the operating room, you will be introduced to the rest of the surgical staff. You will be helped onto the operating table and monitors will be placed to keep watch over your vital signs. You may also have compression stockings or compression sleeves put on your legs.COMPRESSION SYSTEMSCompression systems (see examples below) work by squeezing your legs to help blood flow and circulation. This prevents blood from pooling and clots from developing. Compression Stockings: Special elastic (stretchy) garments worn around the legs to constantly squeeze the limbs. These can be worn home after the procedure.Compression Sleeves: Thesesleeves wrap around your lowerlegs and fill with air every so oftento squeeze your legs. These areonly used in the hospital. Once you are on the operating table, your anesthesiologist will begin to give you anesthesia. Anesthesia is the process of giving medication so that you are in a pain free, tranquil, sleeplike state for your surgery. Your anesthesiologist has several techniques (see the following section) to keep you comfortable and without pain during your surgery. Some medical conditions may help the anesthesiologist decide which technique is best for you. You should discuss this with both your surgeon and your anesthesiologist. Whichever technique is chosen, it is important for you to know that your operating room experience will be a painless and tranquil one. TYPES OF ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia. First you are given medication so that you will be in a sleeplike state. Then you will have an anesthetic given to you through a mask, which will be placed over your nose and mouth. During the operation, monitors will be connected to you that will show your heart rhythm and rate, oxygen level in your blood, body temperature, and blood pressure. Your anesthesiologist continually checks these monitors.Regional Anesthesia. Some patients do not want regional anesthesia because they think that they will be awake during the procedure. This is not true. With regional anesthesia, you are also given medications that let you sleep peacefully throughout the operation. However, unlike general anesthesia, when regional anesthesia is no longer being given to you, you will wake up almost immediately and without pain (because the anesthesia is still working). Types of regional anesthesia include spinal anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks. You are still watched carefully when this type of anesthesia is used. It is not uncommon for patients to elect to have a combination of regional and general anesthesia.In the Operating RoomSports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 19after surgery: the road to recoveryWhat Should I Expect after Surgery Is Over? 20Postoperative Instructions and Follow Up 22Recovering at Home 24Physical Therapy 26Durable Medical Equipment 27cmc.med.nyu.edu Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 1920 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookWAKING UPAfter surgery, you will be taken to the recovery area, which is also called the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU). While you are recovering from anesthesia, your surgeon will talk with your family and friends to let them know that the surgery is over and how things went, but only if you have already given us permission to do so. When you wake up from anesthesia, and the effects of the medication wear off, you will be in the recovery area. It is a large, open room that you will share with other patients recovering from surgery. You may wake up confused and you may not know where you are. A nurse will be close by to talk to you and watch you until you are fully awake.CONTROLLING YOUR PAINIt is normal to be in pain after your surgery. Your nurse will ask you to rate your pain on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 means you have no pain and 10 means you have the worst pain you can imagine). Please be honest when describing your pain. Managing your pain is an important part of your recovery. If you are in too much pain it may make it difficult for you to exercise and participate in physical therapy.If you had general anesthesia, you may have a sore throat from the tube that was placed to help you breathe. It is normal to be nauseous or even to throw up from the anesthesia. Your nurse will give you medication for pain or nausea if you need it. TIP: Be sure to let your nurse know if your pain medication seems to stop working too quickly or if you feel nauseous. All patients react to medications differently, and the sooner the medical team can help, the better you will feel.WHAT AM I WEARING ON MY ARM/LEG?You may also see that you are wearing a brace or a sling. It is used to protect your arm or leg and to stop it from moving. Please do not move the device yourself. If it is uncomfortable, ask the nurse for help. You should wear your brace or sling until your first follow up appointment, when more instructions will be given to you. Before you leave, a member of your medical team will show you how to put the brace or sling on, and how to take it off. Your arm or leg may be wrapped in ice or another method of cooling to help lessen the swelling. Let your nurse know if it is uncomfortable. More information on our medical equipment and suppliers can be found in the Durable Medical Equipment section.STARTING TO MOVE AROUNDYour nurse will offer you a small amount of food and drink after your vital signs have returned to normal and your pain is controlled. If you had general anesthesia, you will be asked to get out of bed as soon as you can eat and drink without feeling sick. If you had regional anesthesia, your nurse will periodically check the feeling in your legs. As soon as your nurse decides that you have enough feeling in your legs to stand safely, you will be asked to get out of bed, with help. If you are not allowed to stand without help, a set of crutches or a wheelchair will be provided.TIP: If you have your own crutches or wheelchair at home, bring them with you to the hospital.When you are ready, your nurse will show you how to use your crutches properly and safely. What Should I Expect after Surgery Is Over?Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 21WHEN CAN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?For many procedures, you can leave the hospital and return home on the same day as your surgery. You will be allowed to leave when:• You can get to a bathroom on your own• You have urinated• Your vital signs are back to normal• Your pain is controlled by oral medications • You have been given postoperative instructions (for example, use of crutches, braces, ice, etc.) Once your surgeon and medical team decide that it is safe for you to return home, your IV will be removed. You can then get dressed in private. A member of the staff will tell your family and/or friends where they can come to meet you and bring you home. TIP: Be sure that you have all of your personal belongings before you leave the hospital.If you are not able to go home on the same day as your surgery, you will be moved from the recovery room to a hospital room. Your family and friends will be allowed to visit you in your hospital room.22 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookWHEN DO I GO FOR MY POSTOPERATIVE (AFTER SURGERY) APPOINTMENT?You should go to your surgeon’s office within the first 7 to 14 days after surgery. Your appointment will be scheduled before your surgery. If you do not have a follow up appointment scheduled for after your surgery, please call the scheduling office at 646.501.7223. During this appointment, your stitches and/or staples will be removed. Any braces, bandages, and dressings will also be removed. Additional steps will be taken, as necessary. These will include:• Examine you to check your
