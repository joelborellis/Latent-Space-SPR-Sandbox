Vicki Match Suna, AIA Executive Vice President and Vice Dean Real Estate Development and Facilities NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines INTRODUCTION Real Estate Development and Facilities 3 2023 INTRODUCTION Purpose With over 13 million square feet at locations throughout the New York metropolitan region, NYU Langone Health leases, owns and operates an enormous variety of buildings. The NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines have been created as a guide for architects, interior designers, engineers and Real Estate Development + Facilities Project Managers (PM), etc. to design existing and new facilities. We understand all projects are unique. As such, it is expected the Architectural/Engineering Team (A/E Team) shall take into account existing site conditions, user requirements, building codes, these Design Guidelines, and all other requirements as necessary to design our facilities. In addition, these guidelines are not intended to repeat or replace any code mandated requirements. Compliance with relevant codes is the sole responsibility of the A/E Team. Goals  Efficiency A principal goal of the Design Guidelines is to improve the efficiency of the design process. We can improve operations and maintenance by creating a commonality of systems and products across our expanding portfolio. Where appropriate, approved materials and products are indicated in the guidelines. The aim is not to limit design expression but to guide the architects and engineers toward solutions that are in conformance with our construction and maintenance practices. Improving efficiency in design, construction and operations is of substantial financial benefit to our institution.  Design Excellence and Quality Construction NYU Langone Health is committed to design excellence, and stands by the premise that intelligent planning, inspired design, meticulous documentation, and quality construction are all indispensable to this effort, and will bring added value to our organization. The guidelines have been created in support of this goal. Applicability These guidelines will be updated periodically. The PM on a particular project will advise when new updates are available. Access and Exceptions The Design Guidelines can be accessed on both BuildFlow (the NYU Langone Health construction document management site) and the RED+F website: http://nyulangone.org/vendor supplier information/design guidelines Designers may seek approval of deviations from or alternatives/additions to the Design Guidelines by written request to the PM, who will forward such requests to the RED+F Design Studio for review. The PM will advise the designer in writing whether or not the proposed deviation, alternative or addition is approved. Under no circumstances shall deviation from the Design Guidelines be construed as a basis for additional services.

The physical environment should encourage flexibility and an adaptive environment. 6. NYU Langone Health will be a premier “service” organization that is:  safe  supportive of faculty, clinicians, students, patients and visitors  disease focused  innovative  responsive to market forces and dynamics 7. The faculty response to clinical needs must be fiscally responsible and provide clear direction for expansion over time, as funds become available. 8. Consistent with the NYU Langone mission and as they support strategic areas, innovative methods and technologies will be anticipated and incorporated into clinical programs and practices. 9. All facilities should provide space in support of the educational and training mission of the Medical School and the University. 10. The care that we provide at NYU Langone Health results from a team effort working on behalf of the patient and family. 11. All facilities should embrace sustainable and evidence based parameters in design, materials, equipment and technology. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines DESIGN PRINCIPLES Real Estate Development and Facilities 8 2023 DESIGN PRINCIPLES NYU Langone Health is committed to design excellence and demands the highest quality built environment. We stand by the premise that intelligent planning, inspired design, meticulous documentation and quality construction are all indispensable to this effort. As part of our mission devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research, we have developed the following design principles: 1. Design Quality  Design solutions must be timeless with a clearly organized concept, developed and reinforced with appropriate materials and details.  Provide innovative solutions that create safe, secure and supportive environments and improve workflow.  Develop design solutions that strengthen the NYU Langone brand. 2. Construction Quality  The built environment must have the highest possible quality of construction appropriate to the project scope, budget and schedule. 3. Cost Effectiveness  Design solutions must be cost effective and fiscally responsible. 4. Schedule Compliance  Design and construction schedules must be maintained. 5. Design Flexibility  The physical environment should encourage flexibility and adaptability and provide clear direction for expansion over time. 6. Efficient, Functional and Practical  Designs should look to improve workflow, support efficient, LEAN based operations, and create environments that are easily maintained. 7. Intuitive Wayfinding  The circulation pattern from point of entry to final destination must be clearly visible and easily understood. 8. Durable Materials  Materials and finishes must last over time and be easily maintainable. 9. Attention to Detail  It is critical that details are thoughtfully designed, thoroughly documented and carefully constructed. 10. Collaborative Process  NYU Langone Health promotes an integrated team approach in the development and construction of projects. It is essential that all stakeholders have input in the process. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines GENERAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS Real Estate Development and Facilities 9 2023 GENERAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 1. Architects Agreement Architects are required to execute NYU Langone Health’s Standard Master Owner Architect Agreement (the “Agreement”); no exception may be taken to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between these Design Guidelines and the provisions of the Agreement, the provisions of the Agreement shall govern. 2. Communication and Approach NYU Langone Health promotes a team approach in the development and construction of projects. We believe it is essential that all stakeholders have input into the process. This includes the User, Real Estate Development + Facilities (RED+F), Medical Center Information Technology (MCIT), Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S), Security, Environmental Services/ Building Services, etc. The RED+F Project Manager (PM) will act as the main contact on the project to ensure all elements are coordinated. The Architectural/Engineering team (A/E Team) is encouraged to initiate and sustain open communications throughout the project. All communication with the A/E Team will be handled through their primary contact, the PM. Other contacts listed in this document should only be contacted at the direction of the PM. 3. Roles and Responsibilities The following is a list of NYU Langone departments with whom the A/E Team will likely have regular contact during the planning, design and construction process:  Real Estate Development and Facilities (RED+F) RED+F is the client. They provide planning information as well as architecture and engineering design review for projects. This includes information on related or concurrent projects, NYU Langone practices, policies and space standards. RED+F has a staff of in house architects, engineers and designers that oversee the design of all NYU Langone capital projects.  Sponsor The Sponsor for a capital project is the department or group that is funding the project.  User The User is the department or group that will occupy the project after it is constructed. They have an important responsibility to provide feedback on their functional and programmatic needs, workflow requirements and to sign off on the plan. The plan sign off is a critical schedule milestone that determines when Construction Documents begin and when the Users will be able to move in. The Users will be shown the proposed materials and finishes for the project and be allowed to provide input on functional issues. The aesthetic approval of the finishes will be the sole responsibility of RED+F. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines GENERAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS Real Estate Development and Facilities 10 2023 The following is a list of key project participants with whom the A/E Team will likely have regular contact during the planning, design and construction process:  RED+F Project Manager (PM) The PM is the primary contact for all aspects of the project.

Typically, projects are formulated for approval and are then guided through Design and Construction by an assigned NYU Langone project manager (RED+F PM) who follows a defined process to formulate and implement construction projects based on a specified scope, schedule and budget to meet the goals and needs of all stakeholders. 1. Formulation & Planning  Formulation To ensure that NYU Langone Health’s resources are utilized in the most effective manner, most projects are initiated through Senior Administration. Individual departments can also initiate small department funded projects by contacting RED+F directly. These requests are then reviewed by Senior Administration and, if approved, authorized to proceed. Requests are evaluated based on their importance in supporting NYU Langone Health’s vision and strategic goals, space requirements, staffing requirements, potential impact on other programs, and funding sources.  Planning If Senior Administration determines a requested project merits further investigation, RED+F will do a planning study to identify the project objectives, scope, budget and schedule requirements. This is an iterative process, which attempts to balance project requirements with available resources. Throughout this process, RED+F provides professional assistance to define the primary objective of the project, the specific needs of the user department and the potential solutions. Working with Senior Administration, RED+F then analyzes the options in a campus wide context and establishes target budgets. By identifying key relationships, such as adjacencies to public spaces, utility connections, and potential future uses of the site, broad facility issues can be addressed one project at a time. The best options are re examined and re analyzed until a viable solution is found. For major projects, RED+F will often contract outside consulting firms to work with the user group through a process of defining the project goals, developing the space program, identifying and analyzing options, and budgeting. Throughout this process, RED+F will review the progress with Senior Administration. At the conclusion of the planning study, a formal report is prepared to document the project scope, budget, and schedule for approval by Senior Administration. For small projects, the planning process is similar, but usually less complex and without the involvement of outside consultants.  Approvals During the Formulation Process, RED+F develops a clear statement of project objectives. This statement is incorporated into a final report along with the space program, schedule, and project budget for approval by Senior Administration and to serve as a guide throughout the design process. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 21 2023 All projects move through an approval process to ensure that NYU Langone Health’s resources are managed effectively. The parties involved in the approval process and the number of approvals required varies depending on the project category, the size of the budget, and other considerations. As projects are planned, they are incorporated into a comprehensive capital plan, either as a specific line item or as a broad allowance (pools). The capital plan is developed within the framework of a long term financial plan. Both the capital plan and the financial plan are updated regularly to ensure that the future costs of any planned capital investments are accounted for in the long term financial plan. As projects become more defined, capital and operating budget implications are considered and the capital and financial plans are updated, reviewed and prioritized by NYU Langone Senior Leadership and approved by NYU Langone Health’s Finance Committee. The planning studies prepared in the previous phase not only identify each project's objective, scope, budget, and schedule, but they also include a Project Authorization Form with signature lines for each of the parties responsible for approval. When all signatures on the form are received the project account is established and the design process begins. 2. Design Phase Once approved, a NYU Langone project manager (RED+F PM) is assigned to the project and a project user group is established. Starting with a design kick off meeting, the PM coordinates a series of meetings with the Users and the Project Team to gather information. This group comprising representatives from users, the Design Studio, Facilities Management, MCIT, Senior Administration, architectural and engineering consultants, and the construction manager, if applicable will guide the project through planning and design. Its meetings provide a forum for coordination of the various aspects of the project during the design process.  Schematic Design (SD) This first phase of the design process defines the design parameters and the overall layout. The A/E Team generates schemes based on information gathered from a field investigation (documenting existing conditions) as well as from Users. The PM brings in other NYULH departments (Design Studio, Facilities, MCIT, Infection Prevention and Control, EH&S, Security, etc.) to help inform the design from their perspectives. Schemes are reviewed by all stakeholders and refined accordingly. An estimate will be prepared at the end of this preliminary design phase to verify that the project remains within budget. The budget must be reconciled with scope prior to proceeding with the next phase of design.

There is often heavy User involvement to be sure that the design adheres to their needs. The PM brings in other NYU Langone Health departments (Design Studio, Facilities, MCIT, Infection Prevention and Control, EH&S, Security, etc.) to help inform the design from their perspectives. All key design decisions are made and agreed upon by the end of this phase. The PM works with the A/E Team to keep scope in line with what was initially approved, with the addition of any changes incorporated during preliminary design. The PM must approve any changes to the agreed upon and authorized scope of the project as such changes would have impacts on the project budget. An estimate is prepared at the end of the Design Development phase and the budget must be reconciled with the project scope prior to proceeding with the next phase. In addition, the User must sign off on the floor plan(s) in a timely manner in order for the A/E Team to proceed into the Construction Document phase and maintain the overall project schedule.

Details are further refined as construction issues are addressed. The main emphasis of this phase is to verify that all needed information is on the drawings and in the specifications so that the project can be bid for construction. Typically, there are fewer meetings in this phase that require the involvement of the Users, as the emphasis is documentation of earlier design decisions. Again, previously agreed upon and authorized scope, schedule and budget must be adhered to, and the Project Manager works with the A/E Team to keep scope in line, taking into account any changes incorporated during previous phases. At the end of this phase the Project Manager puts the project out to bid.

Construction Phase After the Design phase the Project Manager coordinates construction of the project according to the construction drawings and specifications set by the Contract Documents. Project Managers have expertise in architecture, engineering, design and construction to bring capital construction and renovation projects forward from design to completion and occupancy.  Bidding and Negotiation (B/N) As a given project moves from development to the construction phase, the Project Manager initiates and oversees the bidding and negotiation procedure, forwarding contract documents to a list of pre qualified contractors to solicit bids. During the ensuing bid period, the Project Manager and a NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 25 2023 consulting team (typically an architect and engineer) answer questions raised by bidders, making sure all bidders are aware of all questions asked and answered. At the end of bidding, contractors submit their proposed prices in sealed bids. Once the bids are opened, a leveling process ensues ̶ a critical part of the process; leveling vets out discrepancies among bids to ensure an “apples to apples” comparison. A/E Deliverables: Meeting Minutes Participation in Pre Bid Conferences and Site Walkthroughs Bid Documents (Instructions to Bidders, Bid Form, Drawings and Specifications) Written RFI Responses Review and Approval of product substitution(s), “or equal” product(s) Bid Leveling and Evaluation Assist with bid negotiations and bidder selection Final Construction Documents (including supplemental Addendums issued prior to award of construction contract)  Construction Administration (CA) Once leveling is completed, the project is awarded to the qualified bidder with the lowest bid, and a contract sets an agreed upon price for the work and commits the winning contractor to the authorized scope, schedule and budget. Starting with a construction kick off meeting and continuing through the life of the project, the Project Manager sets goals and continually reviews the progress of construction with a focus on maintaining schedule and budget. During construction, the Project Manager also orchestrates the coordination required with all other team members and organizations with ancillary project responsibilities, such as the Design Studio, Facilities, IT, Environmental Health & Safety, Radiation Safety, Infection Prevention and Control, Life Safety, Clinical Engineering and Security; as well as interior designers and other specialty consultants. During this phase the A/E Team is responsible for helping the Contractor build the project as specified in the NYU Langone approved Construction Documents. This is done through coordination with NYU Langone and the builder, inspection of physical “as built” conditions and review of project documents prepared by the Contractor.

The PIM # must appear clearly on the drawing sheet(s).  Regulatory Agency Application Numbers The NYC Department of Buildings job number for projects in New York City or the equivalent for projects in municipalities outside of New York City must appear clearly on the drawing sheet(s).  Discipline Codes All drawing/model files, content and support files shall be prefixed with the appropriate Discipline Code (D). Discipline codes in use by NYU Langone Health are in line with the national CAD standards. The most common are listed in the table below: Code Discipline Name Code Discipline Name A Architectural L Landscape C Civil M Mechanical E Electrical P Plumbing FP Fire Protection S Structural  Drawing List Standards Drawing sets shall be organized as described below: A 000 General Information A 100 Floor Plans A 200 Elevations A 300 Exterior Details A 400 Interior Details A 500 Vertical Transportation A 600 Reflected Ceiling Plans A 700 Finish Plans A 800 Schedules Note: Consultant drawings should follow the same format (i.e. M 000 General Information, M 100 Floor Plans, etc.). NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines CAD DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS Real Estate Development and Facilities 49 2023  File Naming Standards All electronic project information should be named following the nomenclature outlined in these guidelines. This will ensure that projects can be accurately maintained during production, archived at each milestone and retrieved for future use. Drawing Files (.dwg) Drawing Files should be named beginning with the Project Identification Number followed by a dash, the Sheet Number, underscore and the Sheet Name. The filename should take the form of: PIM# Sheet Number_Sheet Name.format As an example, an Architecture Drawing File would be named as follows: 10662 A 100_First Floor Plan.dwg Model Files (.rvt) Model Files should be named beginning with the Project Identification Number followed by a dash, and a Discipline Code. If multiple models are being submitted for a single discipline you may use a level 2 designator as outlined in the national CAD standards. The filename should take the form of: PIM# D.format As an example, an Architecture Revit Model File would be named as follows: 10662 A.rvt Plotsheet Files (.dwfx / .pdf) Plotsheet Files should be named beginning with the Project Identification Number, followed by a dash, the Sheet Number, underscore and the Sheet Name.

NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SPACE PLANNING Real Estate Development and Facilities 54 2023 SPACE PLANNING RED+F has developed this subsection based on space planning layouts that we have found to be successful at NYU Langone Health. Our goal in providing this information is to streamline the design process by providing the Architect and Interior Designer pertinent information they can use during the programming and planning phases of a project. The information provided includes: 1. Floor Area Definitions 2. Planning Definitions 3. Formulas and Ratios 4. Space Types by Staff Title 5. Typical Room Sizes and Furniture Layouts This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of designing a project that is code compliant and appropriate to the needs of the user. The Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other room and furniture layouts if they believe the proposed layouts support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project. 1. Floor Area Definitions The Architect and Interior Designer shall provide floor area information to NYU Langone based on the following definitions:  Gross Square Feet (GSF) Floor area measured to the outside face of a building’s exterior walls. GSF shall include the exterior wall thickness and all vertical penetrations (i.e. mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and elevator shafts, stairwells, etc.), as well as basements and garages.  Gross Departmental Square Feet (GDSF) The floor area for each department shall be measured from the outside face of a building’s exterior walls, the centerline of shared walls and to the corridor side of corridor walls. Building and Floor Common Elements shall be apportioned based on the percentage of the floor occupied by each department. In cases where the department occupies an entire floor of a building the GSF shall be used.  Usable Square Feet (USF) Gross floor area less Building Common Elements. For multi tenant/department floors, Floor Common Elements shall be apportioned based on the percentage of the floor occupied by each tenant/department. (per REBNY)  Net Square Feet (NSF) The area occupied by each identified program space measured to the centerline of interior partitions. Examples of such spaces include individual workspaces (i.e. workstations and offices), dedicated support spaces (i.e. conference rooms), shared support spaces (i.e. shared copier rooms, break rooms, etc.) and special mission critical spaces (i.e. exam rooms, laboratories, etc.). Note: Building Common Elements, Floor Common Elements, and primary and secondary circulation are not included. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SPACE PLANNING Real Estate Development and Facilities 55 2023  Building Common Elements The building core and common elements include portions of a building that serve all tenants. Such items, inclusive of their nominal 4” enclosing walls, include equipment/utility rooms (i.e. mechanical, electrical and telecom rooms serving the entire building), HVAC shafts, telecom / electrical distribution shafts, elevator shafts, public stairwells, etc. (per REBNY)  Floor Common Elements The floor common elements include portions of a floor that serve all tenants of that floor. Such items, not inclusive of their enclosing walls, include corridors, common toilets, shared supply rooms, etc. (per REBNY) 2. Planning Definitions The Architect and Interior Designer shall provide planning information/calculations to NYU Langone based on the following definitions:  Max. Allowable Occupancy Maximum occupancy of a space as calculated per the Building Code(s). Note: The A/E Team needs to calculate the maximum allowable occupancy within a space per the Building Code(s) based on several factors including but not limited to egress stair widths, exit door widths, plumbing fixture counts, etc.  Workplace Seating (WPS) Seating designated for use by a single employee. This can be located within an open area or in an enclosed room as described below. Total workplace seating represents the total number of employees in a particular department. o Open Workplace Seating Seating designated for use by a single employee in an open area. This is a permanent seat such as a: Workstation Bench Reception o Enclosed Workplace Seating Seating designated for use by a single employee in an enclosed room such as a: Private Office  Collaboration Seating Seating available for use by a group of employees and/or visitors. This can be located within an open area or in an enclosed room as described below: o Open Collaboration Seating Seating available for use by a group of employees and/or visitors in an open area. Examples of such seating include: Waiting Areas Pantries Open Collaboration areas o Enclosed Collaboration Seating Seating available for use by a group of employees and/or visitors in an enclosed room. Examples of such seating include: Quiet Rooms Discussion Rooms Conference Rooms Training Rooms Multi Purpose Rooms NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SPACE PLANNING Real Estate Development and Facilities 56 2023 3. Formulas and Ratios The following information is intended to assist the Architect and Interior Designer during the planning and programming phases. The Architect and Interior Designer must also factor in circulation and support spaces (i.e. copy rooms, filing rooms, storage closets, lactation rooms, etc.) into their design.  USF = GSF (Building Common Elements)  USF / WPS = USF ÷ Total # Anticipated WPS Note: On average Administrative spaces should result in a USF / WPS of 100 150 sf.  Ratio of Open WPS = # of Open WPS ÷ Total # of WPS Note: On average Administrative spaces should result in a Ratio of Open WPS of 75 .  Ratio of Workplace Seats to Collaboration Seats: Note: Administrative spaces have the following approximate ratios based on seating types for a department: Workplace Seating : Collaboration Seating =1 : 0.6to1 : 1 Encl. Workplace Seating : Open Workplace Seating =1 : 2.8to1 : 5.4 Encl. Collaboration Seating : Open Collaboration Seating =1 : 0.3to1 : 0.4 Workplace Seating : Enclosed Collaboration Seating =1 : 0.4to1 : 0.6 Workplace Seating : Open Collaboration Seating =1 : 0.2to1 : 0.5 Workplace Seating : Pantry Seating =1 : 0.2to1 : 0.3 Open Workplace Seating : Lockers =1 : 1to 1 : 1.5 Workplace Seating : Waiting =1 : 0.05to1 : 0.1Legend: USF = Usable Square Feet GSF = Gross Square Feet WPS = Workplace Seats NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SPACE PLANNING Real Estate Development and Facilities 57 2023 4.

NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 93 2023 ERGONOMICS NYU Langone Health is committed to providing a healthy work environment where our patients, visitors, students and staff are healthy, safe, comfortable and productive. In line with that effort RED+F has developed this subsection in collaboration with NYU Langone’s Occupational & Industrial Orthopedic Center (OIOC) to encourage Architects and Interior Designers to consider user body size, strength and range of motion as well as surrounding environmental factors in the design of our projects. The information provided includes: 1. Ergonomic Design Considerations 2. Helpful Resources This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of designing a project that is code compliant and appropriate to the needs of the user. The Architect and Interior Designer may suggest layouts and products not shown in these guidelines if they believe the proposed layouts and products support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project. 1. Ergonomic Design Considerations When applying ergonomics, the Architect and Interior Designer shall consider the nature of the user (physical body dimensions and any individual limitation), the type of task(s) they perform, the layout of the workspace, the work organization, and the equipment/tools used. The primary focus is to create the most efficient and injury free interface between people and the tools and technology they use. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider the following:  Human Body The Architect and Interior Designer should familiarize themselves with anthropometric data, which provides a good understanding of body measurement variation and movement limitation for the main user population. Having a good grasp of this information will allow the A/E Team to provide for appropriate: Clearances (i.e. headroom, elbow room, legroom, etc.) between the body and surrounding objects, https://slideplayer.com/slide/3410524/ NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 94 2023 Reach towards objects and equipment allowing for placement and adjustment of these items in appropriate reach zones, and https://www.bostontec.com/ergonomics/ Posture, promoting healthy and safe body positioning through responsible furniture layouts and selection. https://www.joionline.net/library/show/ergonomics_in_the_workplace/ NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 95 2023 NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 96 2023 Further, Architects and Interior Designers should understand that most designed furniture targets the 5th 95th percentile of users, or of the user population. This means that the expectation is that their designs meet the needs of of our users. For the of users outside of this range, NYU Langone will assess the workspace, as requested, and provide recommendations to the end user. Architects and Interiors Designers should integrate adjustability and flexibility into their furniture layouts and selections. https://www.bostontec.com/ergonomics/  Environment The Architect and Interior Designer should keep the following items in mind during design, including relevant code requirements and industry standards: Light To minimize end user eye strain Architects and Interior Designers should ensure that artificial lighting is not too bright, natural light does not impede the use of equipment such as computer or digital screens, glare is minimized from both artificial and natural sources, and task lighting is provided accordingly. The use of proper lighting equipment and controls as well as window drapes and shades should be integrated into the design. Ventilation Architects and Interior Designers should ensure that users have adequate fresh air ventilation and heating or cooling so that they feel comfortable when working. Noise Noise can cause stress leading to tensed muscles increasing the risk of injury. Architects and Interior Designers should locate and arrange workstations to allow for quiet surroundings around work areas, wherever possible. 2.

NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ROOM FINISHES Real Estate Development and Facilities 97 2023 ROOM FINISHES In accordance with both our Mission devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research and our Design Principles of providing timeless designs that are cost effective, efficient, functional and practical, RED+F has developed a palette of typical materials and finishes that we have found to be successful for various spaces at NYU Langone Health. Our goals in listing these materials and finishes are to:  Streamline the design process  Assist the Architect and Interior Designer with specifying materials  Comply with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all materials and finishes  Create spaces that are timeless, durable, easily maintainable and cost effective  Create a consistent NYU Langone brand The Architect and Interior Designer should use this as a guide for specifying the finishes on NYU Langone capital projects. This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of specifying materials that are appropriate and code compliant for specific spaces. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider specifying existing building specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Also, the Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other materials and finishes if they believe those proposed materials and finishes will support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project.

Our goals in listing these materials and finishes are to:  Streamline the design process  Assist the Architect and Interior Designer with specifying materials  Comply with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all materials and finishes  Create spaces that are timeless, durable, easily maintainable and cost effective  Create a consistent NYU Langone brand The Architect and Interior Designer should use this as a guide for specifying the finishes on NYU Langone capital projects. This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of specifying materials that are appropriate and code compliant for specific spaces. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider specifying existing building specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Also, the Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other materials and finishes if they believe those proposed materials and finishes will support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project.

The NYU Langone Health Art Program and Collection is integrated into the daily life of our organization providing a life affirming, healing and supportive environment for patients, families, caregivers, students, faculty and staff. This is achieved through acquisitions, exhibitions, donations of art and other related visual arts programming. Acquisitions meet overall quality standards with the aim that the art collection appreciates in value over time. 1. Importance of Art in a Healthcare Environment  Over the past decade, art has become an integral component in healthcare environments. As indicated in the State of the Field Report: Arts in Healthcare/2009 survey, nearly half of all healthcare institutions reported having arts in healthcare programs with the majority of these in hospital settings. Studies have shown that these programs improve patients’ overall health outcomes, treatment compliance and quality of life, and foster a positive environment for caregivers that reduces stress and improves workplace satisfaction and employee retention. Spot (2018) © Donald Lipski. NYU Langone Art Program and Collection. Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. Photo © Jeff Goldberg/Esto 2. Means of Selecting Art  The Design Studio’s Art Group at RED+F identifies and acquires art through gallery visits, studio visits, recommendations as provided by museum curators, art critics and contemporary art historians and Calls to Artists as posted on visual art websites (New York Foundation for the Arts, Public Arts Network, etc.) 3. Capital Construction Projects Many capital construction projects provide excellent opportunities to integrate art into the design of these new facilities.  Emphasis will focus on public spaces with higher visibility resulting in greater impact.  For patient areas, the inclusion and placement of artwork will be a calming distraction.  Placement of artwork will also support wayfinding efforts.  Goal is to create a singular vision and identity throughout an individual project through selection and placement of artwork.  Selection of site specific artwork will involve input from user groups occupying the space.  Art will be selected from a range of artists, from emerging to established.

NYU Langone Art Program and Collection. Science Building. Photo © Rene Perez 4. Architect’s Responsibilities Where art integration is part of the project scope, art selection will be the responsibility of the Design Studio’s Art Group at RED+F. The A/E Team shall assist with identifying locations for art placement in a project including but not limited to the following:  During Design Development, the architect will work with the Art Manager, Project Manager and users to identify potential locations for art.  The A/E Team shall provide drawings sufficient to identify proposed art locations including plans, elevations and perspectives.  The A/E Team will be responsible for keeping any walls that have been identified for artwork integration, free and clear of any and all electrical devices, room and directional signage, or other potentially distracting items. This includes electrical outlets, telephone/data outlets, light switches, thermostats, fire strobes, furniture, etc.  The A/E Team shall ensure the art has proper lighting. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING Real Estate Development and Facilities 174 2023 ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING The architect is required to use RED+F’s assigned room numbers, and provide full design and programming services related to signage and wayfinding. The A/E Team shall follow the NYU Langone Wayfinding and Communications Standards Manual, available on the Real Estate Development and Facilities website at: http://nyulangone.org/vendor information/design guidelines. The manual specifies each signage type approved for use at NYU Langone Health facilities. For off campus projects, the A/E Team shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with any building landlord requirements. 1. Architect’s Responsibilities  The architect shall submit the signed off floor plans to the Space Planning and Management Group at RED+F who shall assign the room numbers. The architect shall insert these room numbers on the drawings. RED+F will not accept any other room numbers shown on the documents.  Confirm the Room Number Prefix (if any) with the Design Studio’s Signage/Wayfinding Group at RED+F. The architect shall use this Room Number Prefix to produce their signage programming documents.  Confirm requirements for code required emergency/egress signage (i.e. stair and elevator fire egress maps and messaging) and health/safety signage (i.e. chemical, laboratory, hazardous material, radiation, etc.) with Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) at RED+F.  Present signage design options to the Signage/Wayfinding Group.  Produce signage programming documents that include location plans and message schedules for review and approval by the Signage/Wayfinding Group.  Review and approve shop drawings. Shop drawings are also to be forwarded to the Signage/Wayfinding Group for their review and approval.  Punchlist installed signage in coordination with Signage/Wayfinding Group.  Final acceptance of the signage in conjunction with the Signage/Wayfinding Group. Architects, or their consultant, shall be responsible for signage/wayfinding on capital projects. Where there is no architect, signage/wayfinding shall be the responsibility of the Signage/Wayfinding Group. The sign design package may be created by the Architect, a pre approved signage consultant or one of the NYU Langone approved signage vendors. If available, SignAgent shall be used to upload and share project documentation with NYULH and the signage fabricator/installer. When used, NYULH shall be granted visibility, access and full ownership permissions to any project documentation managed with SignAgent. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING Real Estate Development and Facilities 175 2023 2. Sign Planning and Programming Process There are five groups of signs comprising the NYU Langone system: identification, directional, informational, regulatory, and pageantry. Before programming a facility’s signs, the complete sign typology (contained within the NYU Langone Wayfinding and Communications Standards Manual) should be understood by the signage programmer. The following outlines a step by step approach for sign planning and programming.  Analysis When planning and programming signs the programmer shall know the architectural layout, be familiar with the day to day operations and activities of the end users within the space and consider the perspective of first time visitors. Whenever possible, it is recommended that the sign programmer(s) meet with end users to review how the facility will function. The programmer should explore various visitor scenarios, and locate wayfinding decision points (both clear and obscure) along arrival and departure routes. Consider the route distances and turns from start to end point. Typical questions to ask: Where are the restricted access areas, and for what reasons? Who are the visitors, and for what purposes? What kind of sign types are needed, and where?  Visualization of the Space The programmer should imagine a “visitor eye view” through the department. The programmer should enhance comprehension of the architectural character of the visitor experience, of walking the hallways, facing impaired sightlines, or seeking visual landmarks. High and low ceiling space should be noted, along with wall position and angle, both on first entry and closer approach. The programmer should visualize the look and feel of the spaces, and identify optimal sign locations for decision points, avoiding obstacles. If possible, the programmer should suggest the architect revisit particular design details to accommodate sign locations. Typical questions to ask: Are doors or walls opaque or transparent? What color is the wall finish behind reception, and how tall? Is there any art or furniture nearby when determining placement of signage? Are there any devices (electrical outlets, light switches, thermostats, fire alarm strobes, etc.) or other signs nearby that should be considered when determining placement of signage (with respect to height, alignment, etc.)?  Programming Documentation & Clarification The programmer should issue documents for sign vendors to produce message layouts and shop drawings. Draft documents should be submitted to the RED+F PM, end user representative, and the Design Studio’s Signage/Wayfinding Group at RED+F for approval and comments. A unique sign number shall designate floor/location ID (if applicable), designation ID and sign type ID. Typical questions to ask: What is the proper name of the facility? Are there any donor recognition signs? NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines FURNITURE Real Estate Development and Facilities 176 2023 FURNITURE In accordance with both our Mission devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research and our Design Principles of providing timeless designs that are cost effective, efficient, functional and practical, RED+F has compiled a collection of furniture and accessory items that we have found to be successful at NYU Langone Health. Our goals in listing these items are to:  Streamline the design process  Assist the Architect and Interior Designer with specifying furniture and accessory items  Comply with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all furniture and finishes  Create spaces that are timeless, durable, easily maintainable and cost effective  Create a consistent NYU Langone brand The Architect and Interior Designer should use this as a guide for specifying furniture and accessories on NYU Langone capital projects. This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of specifying products that are appropriate and code compliant for specific spaces. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider specifying existing building specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Also, the Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other products if they believe those proposed products will support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project.

STORAGE In order to create and maintain a consistent brand and allow appropriate maintenance at NYU Langone Health spaces, specific furniture and accessory items are used. The list below will give the A/E Team a sense of the typical storage solutions used at NYU Langone facilities. It is the Architect’s responsibility to select items that are code compliant and appropriate for the capital project based on the type of space and end user needs. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider specifying existing building specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Architects shall coordinate with the RED+F Project Manager and the Design Studio to finalize fixture selections. The images shown are for illustrative purposes only and may not be a reflection of a project’s final specification. Please note the following requirements as they pertain to storage:  All substrate shall be formaldehyde free. Please note that it is our mission to decrease the use of paper and to that end please confirm what documents or products must be stored on site when selecting storage fixtures. RED+F can provide assistance in calculating and selecting the proper storage solution. Cost saving Alternatives: The RED+F PM will advise the A/E Design Team if items identified as Cost saving Alternatives shall be allowed on their project. There may be risks associated with using such items, including the need to repair or replace them more often, but it has been determined they are within acceptable range for use on certain NYU Langone Health projects.

NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 296 2023 RECYCLING PROGRAM NYU Langone Health has instituted a system wide recycling program to reduce our waste to landfill, meet our sustainability goals and comply with updated NYC Local Law 87 rules for business recycling. We want to ensure staff, residents and visitors are able to recycle required materials, that the integrity of our recycling program is maintained and that waste and recycling are properly handled by our private carters. In line with that commitment we are providing additional information about NYU Langone’s Recycling Program organized as follows: 1. General Recycling Program Requirements 2. Specific Recycling Program Requirements 3. Signage Requirements 4. Decal Requirements 5. Locations for Trash and Recycling Receptacles 6. Trash and Recycling Receptacle Specifications 1. General Recycling Program Requirements NYU Langone has determined that centralized sorting of trash and recyclables and movement away from individualized collection is the preferred methodology. DSNY rule of thumb: Wherever there is a trash bin, there should also be recycling bin(s). When specifying trash and recycling receptacles, the A/E Team shall:  Confirm project recycling procedures, including any landlord or building requirements. NYU Langone has chosen to pursue source separated recycling. DSNY defines source separated recycling collection as: “The practice of separating the two designated recyclable "streams" from each other and from garbage. These three streams must be kept separate from the point of generation (where staff/customers place an item in a receptacle) until the materials are placed out for collection. Your carter is then required to collect the three streams with three separate trucks or in three separate compartments in a truck.” The three streams include: Trash | Waste | Landfill Paper | Cardboard | Paperboard Recycling Metals | Glass | Plastics | Beverage Cartons Recycling  Provide adequate space on the plans for trash and recycling receptacles to be located in discreet areas (i.e. niches, alcoves, built in millwork, etc.), but still convenient to staff and visitors.  Select container gallon capacities appropriate to the designation, size and type of activity occurring within the space the receptacles serve. Avoid oversized bins (i.e. Clinical facilities shall receive receptacles that are no more than 32 gal. per container).  For Storage and Hauling, the regulation makes it illegal for any hauler to collect recyclables and trash in the same truck. Therefore, the infrastructure to keep these streams separated from point of generation to hauling must be provided by NYU Langone. Project Teams must ensure adequate storage space and loading dock configuration for NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 297 2023 separated trash and recycling. It can be in the same room or on the same dock, but must be clearly separated with its own signage and labeling. Consider predicted waste volume and the activity happening in the space.  Helpful Resources: City of New York Department of Sanitation www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/home https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/docs/commercial recycling notice english.pdf AIA “Zero Waste Design Guidelines” 2. Specific Recycling Program Requirements When specifying trash and recycling receptacles, the A/E Team shall:  For Private Offices and Work Stations, do not provide deskside bins. Should staff or departmental representatives opt to have deskside bins 1 “paper only” receptacle shall be provided under the desk. Deskside bins for items other than “paper only” are not permitted.  For Open Work Areas:, pProvide centralized trash and recycling receptacles placed no more than 50’ 0” apart so that staff walk a maximum of 25’ 0” in either direction to access the nearest receptacle. In calculatingCalculate the capacity usinge the following as a minimum guideline: 1 person = 1 gallon trash + ¾ 1 gallon metal glass plastic + ¾ 1 gallon paper.  For custom built in trash and recycling, such as in: Open Work Areas Conference Rooms Pantries Cafés / Cafeterias Provide millwork with customized drawers or openings sized to fit a standard plastic bin within. Ensure that the cabinet or drawer does not permit movement of the interior bin as that often causes waste to be dropped between the opening and the bin and presents a vermin, cleanliness and odor issue.  Provide compost receptacles at Cafés, Cafeterias and Pantries if composting is available at the site. These receptacles shall be in addition to trash and recycling. Inclusion of a sink for disposing of liquids prior to sorting of waste is encouraged.  For Back of House Areas, coordinate trash and recycling receptacle specification and locations with the Design Studio, appropriate Facilities maintenance department (i.e. Building Services, Environmental Services, etc.) and end user during the Design Development phase.  Any back of house bins needed will be the responsibility of the project team to procure through the standard Furniture process. Please note, Building Services / Clinical Engineering / Environmental Services will continue to provide tan and red step receptacles for clinical and research spaces.Trash and recycling receptacles shall be procured by the RED+F PM either as part of the furniture package or directly from an NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 298 2023 NYULH approved commercial maintenance products vendor. While trash and recycling built into millwork is part of the millwork package it is the responsibility of the RED+F PM to procure the specified internal rigid liner.  For Confidential Paper Recycling, HIPAA paper should always be kept separate for shredding as part of NYU Langone’s existing HIPAA shredding program.  For Universal Waste Recycling, all universal waste shall be stored in accordance with EH&S safety policies and then recycled by either EH&S or MCIT.  For Lab Glass, appropriate bins shall be made available to NYU Langone labs for lab glass collection separate from the recycling program. 3. Signage Requirements There are a variety of different signs required for the Recycling Program at NYU Langone Health. The A/E Team and RED+F PM shall coordinate signage fabrication and installation with NYU Langone Design Studio’s Signage/Wayfinding Group as part of the capital project. The signs shall be located as follows:  Exterior Business Integrity Commission (BIC) hauler decals shall be displayed where they are visible from the outside of a building (if owned, leased by or occupied exclusively by NYU Langone) or tenant space (if leased by NYU Langone and we provide our own waste hauling). BIC decals are supplied by the contracted waste hauler. To obtain BIC decals coordinate with either Environmental Services or Building Services. BIC decals shall be aligned to architectural elements and placed in lower corners of storefront windows away from entry doors. BIC decals shall not be placed adjacent to entry doors, unless it cannot be avoided. Recommended locations, listed in order of highest to lowest preference, are loading docks and exterior waste storage areas, exterior building entries and interior tenant entries. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 299 2023  Public Areas (w/o Composting) The following signage shall be posted wherever trash and recycling centers are provided. Signs shall be printed on Sintra and installed with the bottom edge 3” above the trash and recycling center’s top surface.  Public Areas (w/ Composting) The following signage shall be posted wherever compost is provided in addition to trash and recycling. Signs shall be printed on Sintra and installed with the bottom edge 3” above the trash, recycling and compost center’s top surface. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 300 2023  Back of House Areas The following signage shall be posted in the back of house areas described below: Maintenance/Storage Areas: Areas near compactors or trash and recycling front end loader (FEL) bins, or anywhere else trash and recycling bags are aggregated and stored for more than 20 minutes. Loading Docks: Loading docks of buildings owned or leased by NYU Langone where there is waste hauling infrastructure or storage. 4. Decal Requirements Decals shall be posted on each trash, metal glass plastic, and paper receptacle. Cafés and Cafeterias shall receive an additional decal to be posted at each compost receptacle. The A/E Team and RED+F PM shall coordinate signage fabrication and installation with NYU Langone Design Studio’s Signage/Wayfinding Group as part of the capital project. The decals shall be applied as follows:  Front of House Receptacles Decals shall be 4 1/2” in diameter. Each decal shall be centered on and located directly below its respective opening. Decals shall be black (trash), blue (metal glass plastic), green (paper), or brown (compost in Cafés, Cafeterias and Pantries only) cut vinyl. Cafés / Cafeterias / Pantries (if required) NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 301 2023  Back of House Receptacles Decals shall be 3” in diameter on the short side and 5” in diameter on the long side. Decals shall be centered horizontally on each side of the Slim Jim. The heights of the decals measured from the bottom of the receptacle to the center line of each decal shall be 12”. One 3” decal shall be provided on each short side and one 5” decal shall be provided on each long side of the Slim Jim for a total of 4 decals per bin. Decals shall be custom heat stamped white graphics applied by the manufacturer. Cafés / Cafeterias / Pantries (if required)  Red Medical Waste / Hazardous Receptacles Decals shall be 4” in diameter. Decals shall be centered horizontally on both the lid and front of each bin. Lid decal shall be centered vertically between the outer edge of the lid and top edge of the manufacturer logo. Front decal shall be centered vertically between the bottom edge of the lid and the top edge of the step recess. Decals shall be custom heat stamped white graphics applied by the manufacturer. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 302 2023  Cafés / Cafeterias (Wall Mounted) Decals or signs shall be custom size to fit the architecture. For example, in some cases, the decals will go on a tile wall. In those cases the decal shall be sized to match the height and width of the tiles. Each decal shall be centered on and located directly above its respective opening. Each decal shall be second surface screen printed, back painted on clear acrylic, and no paint on returns. Tray signs should also be provided and be first surface etched and paint filled on 1/4” thick horizontal brushed aluminum.

NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH & SAFETY Real Estate Development and Facilities 347 2023 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH & SAFETY NYU Langone Health’s Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) division develops and manages programs that (1) protect personnel in all departments and on all levels from health and safety hazards, (2) ensure waste is discarded in an environmentally sound manner and (3) facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements for environmental and occupational health and safety. EH&S’s programs cover a broad spectrum of health and safety issues, including but not limited to: asbestos, biosafety, bulk storage tanks, chemical safety, ergonomics, fire safety, hazard communication, hearing conservation, indoor air quality, laboratory and animal safety, mold prevention and remediation, and waste management. 1. Architect’s Responsibilities The A/E Team, to the best of their ability, shall incorporate Best Management Practices for environmental and occupational health and safety into the design of the space. The A/E Team responsibilities include:  Anticipating, identifying and eliminating potential health and safety hazards (i.e. ergonomics, hazardous materials, noise, etc.) associated with the proposed use of the space, to the extent reasonably practical. Note: Eliminating hazards is not intended to limit creativity, but to ensure the designer minimizes foreseeable risks to the health and safety of those who: Carry out construction work, including demolition. May be affected by the project, including building occupants and the general public. Occupy the space post construction. Clean and maintain the space.  Specifying the least toxic, flammable/combustible and reactive products available for construction and renovation.  Where health and safety hazards cannot be eliminated, proposing alternate engineering controls to minimize or eliminate the risk.  The A/E Team shall use and comply with the design and safety regulations, guidelines and references listed in the References subsection below, as well as other health and safety guidelines received from NYU Langone’s Project Manager or division of EH&S. The A/E Team shall utilize the latest editions of the references available at the time of the design contract award.  If the design does not incorporate Best Management Practices for environmental and occupational health and safety, and comply with the References listed below, the A/E design firm shall obtain approval from NYU Langone’s division of EH&S.  The A/E Team shall not specify any of the following without approval from NYU Langone’s division of EH&S: Chemical products containing known (IARC group 1) or probable (IARC group 2a) human carcinogens*. Chemical products containing toxic and hazardous substances listed in OSHA 1910 subpart Z*. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH & SAFETY Real Estate Development and Facilities 348 2023 Chemical products containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in excess of 50 grams/liter. Chemical products for which the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) rates the health, fire or reactivity hazard as greater than “1” (slight hazard) on the NFPA/HMIS scale or as less than “4” (slight hazard) on the GHS hazard scale. Chemical products which emit strong odors. * Exceptions may be made for products containing chemicals which do not pose a hazard to persons during their application/use (i.e. paints containing silica).  In order to minimize potential delays associated with asbestos abatement, the A/E Team shall submit a set of Design Development Drawings that identify the scope of work including complete Demolition Drawings. The Demolition Drawings shall provide sufficient information to initiate an asbestos investigation and pull a demolition permit. The Demolition Drawings submitted shall be the same drawings that are filed with the DOB.  The A/E Team shall confirm requirements for code required emergency/egress signage (i.e. stair and elevator fire egress maps and messaging) and health/safety signage (i.e. chemical, laboratory, hazardous material, radiation, etc.) with Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) at RED+F. 2.

As a healthcare organization, it is imperative that we act as a community leader in environmental stewardship. Creating a vital and healing environment is also central to our mission devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research and is integral to the comfort and lifelong wellness of our staff, students and patients. This sustainability commitment extends across every facet of NYU Langone, including how we design, construct and operate our facilities. Furthermore, the health system recognizes the risks associated with climate change and has committed to being a carbon neutral health system by 2050 with an interim carbon reduction goal by 2030.25 and intends to build facilities that are both sustainable and resilient. The goal of NYU Langone’s sustainability program is to fulfill a quadruple bottom line approach where decision making is based on balancing the potential impacts on people, the planet, business economics and patient care. The goal is not only to design green buildings and use environmentally preferable materials, but to augment our benefit to the community and reduce the negative environmental and human wellness impacts of operations once occupied. Teams should ensure projects exemplify our key sustainability pillars of emissions mitigation, adaptation and resiliency to climate change, health promotion and demonstration of leadership. In line with that commitment we are providing additional information about NYU Langone’s sustainability program organized as follows: 1. Sustainable Building Design Guidelines 2. Green Roof and Solar PV Guidelines 3. Sustainable Furniture and Furnishings Guidelines 4. Sustainable Flooring Guidelines 5. Bicycle Transportation Guidelines 6. Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Guidelines 7. Building Energy Efficiency Rating Label Guidelines 8. Related Components or Policies More can be read about the scope and progress of NYU Langone’s sustainability program, called GreenFirst, at http://nyulangone.org/our story/sustainability. 1. Sustainable Building Design Guidelines For all new construction and major renovation (more than 25,000 square feet or projects that include significant MEP scope), NYU Langone has instituted a goal of achieving Gold or higher level certification under the LEED v4 or v4.1 ratings system. Projects should assess the appropriate project type including BD+C, ID+C or others that may apply. Designers are to discuss the LEED and energy performance requirements with RED+F Project Managers from the outset and to follow an integrative design process. Where achievement of these goals presents significant hurdles for a project, the requirements should be discussed with the RED+F Project Manager, RED+F Leadership, and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager early during the design process. Good communication of goals, requirements and challenges will help all projects achieve the highest levels of performance and innovation while containing costs. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 350 2023 Designers shall assist NYU Langone Health with preparation of the Owner’s Project Requirements (OPR). The OPR shall outline the Project’s environmental and sustainability goals and measures, waste and recycling requirements, energy performance requirements, and other system expectations. A template OPR can be provided by the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager. It shall be reviewed and approved by the RED+F PM and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager. This information is mandatory for LEED certification and will be reviewed by the commissioning agent. If an option, projects must also complete a NYSERDA or whole building energy model simulation as part of meeting its LEED goals and take advantage of available funding or incentives for this work. This can include utility, State or Federal incentives including those outlined for either direct pay or Tax Credit (through the design professional) in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In addition, projects that are 25,000 sq. ft. or greater and within New York City shall comply with Local Law 97. Such projects shall include a review of energy performance, carbon emissions and life cycle costs. AThe life cycle cost review shall be prepared includinginclude energy costs, operating costs and potential future LL97 or other penalties using a moderate approach to carbon coefficients after 20340. The A/E Team may consult with the Energy & Sustainability team regarding reasonable assumptions, space type assignments, campus carbon accounting, and any other aspects of LL97 as needed. For fit outs, interior only and smaller projects, the LEED and energy goals should be discussed with the RED+F Project Manager, RED+F Leadership, and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager at the outset of the design process to establish requirements and goals on a case by case basis. Other guidelines or certification standards that NYU Langone encourages project developers to take into consideration include the WELL Building Standard, the NYC Active Design Guidelines: Promoting Physical Activity and Health in Design, the CDC’s Fitwel standard, My Green Labs certification and resources from the International Institute for Sustainable Laboratories (www.i2SL.org). NYU Langone believes that LEED and green buildings aim to protect, restore and work in harmony with the local environment, existing transit infrastructure and underlying natural systems. In general, green buildings are energy efficient, water conserving, durable and nontoxic, with high quality spaces that incorporate nature. NYU Langone seeks to integrate the following features of well designed green buildings where possible and applicable:  Demonstrate resiliency and adaptability in response to a changing climate and extreme weather events.  Incorporate passive design strategies and Mmaximize use of energy efficient infrastructure and renewable energy sources along (with or without energy storage).  Reduce or eliminate reliance on fossil fuels, in particular, as it relates to carbon emissions targets set by municipal or state authorities to reach carbon emissions reduction targets.  Maximize use of passive solar and natural lighting  Minimize building stormwater runoff by incorporating green roofs, gardens, permeable pavers, bioswells and other green infrastructure (GI) or low impact development (LID) techniques as well as maintain compliance with NYC LL94 where applicable. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 351 2023  Use native and adaptive plants that minimize landscaping and irrigation needs.  Make use of open space, iIncorporate green and open spaces and provide access to the outdoors for patients and staff.  Incorporate facilities and design that encourage the use of alternative transportation methods, particularly biking and public mass transit.  Maximize use of natural lighting and Pprovide views to the outside.  Reduce impact of noise and vibration through use of professional acoustical analysis and design services.Employ good sound and noise management  Provide for improved indoor air quality and minimize the use of chemicals of concern to increase the productivity of staff and reduce recovery time for patients.  Minimize or eliminate the use of mercury containing materials where safe, effective alternatives exist in compliance with NYU Langone Health Safety Policy 170.  Focus on material health. This includes compliance with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all materials and finishes.  Focus on material and product circularity. This includes materials and products that Iincorporate recycled, local and renewably sourced materials, and can be reused or upcycled at the end of life that are highly recyclable at end of life or that can be upcycled into new product  Provide well incorporated waste and recycling segregation and bins using the built environment to inspire encourage proper recycling behavior in occupants (see the Recycling Program subsection of these Design Guidelines)  Facilitate social connectionsSupport occupant mental and emotional health by implementing design strategies to ensure they are informed about their environment and have access to a variety of relaxation and social spaces. An integrative design approach and a life cycle assessment approach are both essential to meet these guidelines and marry green building with sustainable operations and resiliency for the life of the facility. Finding synergies between the built environment and eventual operations is an important concept. For example, incorporation of a green roof feature can provide insulation and lower energy needs, help manage stormwater runoff on the campus and reduce the heat island effect in the NYC community. Or designing with the understanding that the flooring material used not only has an embedded energy, carbon and natural resource footprint, but that the type of material used impacts how the facility needs to be cleaned post occupancy. Material decisions such as these can either facilitate or hinder a reduction in chemical and water usage as part of green cleaning practices. Or designing into the built environment smart waste sorting stations that cater to the type of activity (research, clinical or office) taking place in each space can ultimately drive employees to practice good recycling behaviors. By using an integrative project approach that brings in multiple stakeholders from the outset, project teams can more readily discover synergies and areas for true innovation. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 352 2023 2. Green Roof and Solar PV Guidelines New York City Local Laws 92 and 94 of 2019 require all new and existing buildings undergoing major roof construction or renovation to have a green roof system, solar photovoltaic system, or a combination of both. The regulation also requires projects to meet new, higher solar reflective index (SRI) requirements. Examples of projects affected include new construction, vertical or horizontal building extensions, and replacements of the entire roof deck or assembly. Even when not required by code, Architects are encouraged to consider implementation of green roofs, solar photovoltaics or both on NYU Langone projects to take advantage of the benefits of sustainable roof systems as outlined below:  Achieve points under USGBC LEED standards  Improve resiliency and backup generation  Lower energy costs either through direct offset or through better building insulation  Feed additional distributed energy resources and renewables back into the grid  Reduce the urban heat island effect  Manage stormwater and runoffvia use of green roof systems 3. Sustainable Furniture and Furnishings Guidelines NYU Langone has committed to the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, which impacts furniture purchasing and design decisions. This goal means that at all purchases of freestanding furniture and medical furnishings1 for any individual project are to be specified without the intentional use of the following chemicals of concern: halogenated and brominated flame retardants2, formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, PVC (also known as vinyl) and antimicrobials3. Project teams should discuss with the RED+F Project Manager, RED+F Leadership, the RED+F Design Studio, and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager throughout the process to meet these guidelines and evaluate feasibility. For all projects, regardless of the level of certification or LEED ratings system being pursued, NYU Langone also encourages the use of locally sourced furniture and textiles, furniture that contains pre or post consumer recycled content and the use of wood that is FSC certified. Other standards or certifications to refer to include the ANSI/BIFMA e3 Furniture Sustainability Standard, SCS certified and Cradle to Cradle. Notes: 1 Furniture and medical furnishings include seating (i.e. chairs, stools, sofas, benches, etc.), worksurfaces (i.e. tables, desks, etc.), built in and modular casework systems (i.e. walled desks with seating), beds (including mattresses), storage units (i.e. cabinets, filing cabinets, dressers, drawers, etc.), shelving (i.e. bookshelves, built in shelves, etc.), panels and partitions, cubicle curtains, and window coverings. 2 Eliminate the intentional use of all flame retardants where code permits. When flame retardant chemicals are necessary to meet code requirements, use chemicals that meet GreenScreen Benchmark 3 or 4 of their equivalent. 3 Triclosan and triclocarban are explicitly prohibited. No other added or built in chemical antimicrobials are allowed unless they are registered with the U.S. EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and have published data that show efficacy in a hospital/clinical setting measured by a reduction in healthcare associated infections (HIAs) as part of comprehensive infection control measures. Antimicrobials added to materials or products for the sole purpose of preserving the product are exempt. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 353 2023 4. Sustainable Flooring Guidelines Some of the materials and chemicals used in flooring can make it a negative contributor to indoor air quality, lead to a wide range of adverse health effects including but not limited to asthma, cancer, and developmental impacts, and promote unsustainable cleaning practices. All capital projects, regardless of pursuit of requirements for LEED certification or other building rating systems, shall use flooring materials, coatings, and adhesives free of select chemicals of concern as dictated by Health Care Without Harm’s Healthy Flooring criteria (minimum silver level rating). 5. Bicycle Transportation Guidelines The NYU Langone Bicycle Transportation Policy seeks to foster a bike friendly culture with bike commuter amenities such as parking, security, safety and bike registration. Inclusion of bike amenities shall be discussed with the RED+F Project Manager as well as representatives of the Real Estate team and the Sustainability Manager regardless of pursuit or requirements around LEED certification for a project as specified in these Design Guidelines. The Project shall provide adequate bike parking to meet end user daily demand.  Bike Parking and Amenities Indoor Bike Parking When provided indoors, bike parking shall be within secure bike parking rooms for use by approved staff, faculty and students. These rooms shall be accessible through a keycard reader. For fit outs within leased premises, the A/E Team shall follow the landlord’s rules for the management of indoor bike parking/storage within NYU Langone’s own premises. The Real Estate team can advise on a particular building’s policies. Outdoor Bike Parking Outdoor bike parking may be located outside building entrances and exits, in parking lots or garage structures, within secure courtyards or on terraces. NYU Langone’s preference is for outdoor bike parking to be covered or protected from the outside elements. Bike Commuter Shower Facilities If a project, particularly new construction, can accommodate male/female or a unisex individual shower facility, the A/E Team shall include them in the design. Refer to the Building Accessories subsection of these Design Guidelines for bike rack specifications. 6.

Miscellaneous IT Design Requirements Cable trays external to technology spaces are to be provided by the electrical contractor. They are to be designed by IT Designer and shown on the Electrical drawings. It is critical the cable tray path is coordinated with the MEP. All IDFs require a dedicated pathway back to the BDF. This can take the form of a dedicated telecommunications shaft way, sleeves through the floors of stacked IDFs, and/or conduit runs. Sizing and routing should be determined by the Designer and approved by MCIT. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 359 2023 SECURITY Given its location in the heart of New York City, NYU Langone pays special attention to security in its facilities and operations. In order to bring existing and new locations undergoing renovations in line with our security standards, new security components are required to be installed as additions to existing security systems or completely new installations. Security system design and installation will require varied approaches depending on the Project Type as outlined below: 1. Project Types  Facilities with Existing Security Systems In nearly all facilities that NYU Langone owns or leases, there is an existing security system to which follow on installations will link and we will use that vendor’s equipment for the follow on installation. The vendor of that equipment is the Security Vendor. The RED+F PM and the A/E Team will work with the Security Vendor to develop equipment placement requirements and will meet with NYU Langone’s Security Department at key points during the design and construction process for their review of the security design. Among other things, the Security Department will review the equipment the Security Vendor proposes to use and the pricing. The Security Vendor will work under contract to the construction contractor.  Facilities without Existing Security Systems If the facility is new, there will not be an existing Security Vendor. Accordingly, the Architect shall provide security design services or shall engage the services of a Security Consultant (pre approved by NYU Langone’s Security Department) to provide such services and the Architect will be responsible for the services the Security Vendor would otherwise provide. The project team will work with RED+F’s Project Support Office to determine how to procure the Security Vendor. Alternatively, RED+F may direct the use of an existing Security Vendor. 2. Project Development and Design The following are required milestones for meetings with NYU Langone to determine security needs, develop scope and coordinate final recommendations:  Schematic Design During Schematic Design a meeting with the A/E Team, RED+F’s PM, User Group leadership and any additional stakeholder(s) of the new space shall be held. The purpose of the meeting is to review security needs for the project.  Design Development During the Design Development Phase, the Architect shall provide Floor plans, Furniture plans, Reflected Ceiling plans and Door Hardware information to and meet with the Security Department and Security Vendor at the same time. The Architect will propose for Security Department approval a security system design that incorporates User Group requests, Stakeholder requests, NYU Langone security standards and industry security standards.  Construction Documents During the Construction Document Phase, the Architect (through the RED+F PM) will organize a meeting of the A/E Team, Security Department, and RED+F’s PM to review the proposed security solutions and seek Security Department approval thereof. The Security Vendor will provide the A/E Team with equipment cut NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 360 2023 sheets, cabling and rough in requirements. The A/E Team will incorporate this information into the Construction Documents. A final meeting will be held with the A/E Team, Security Department, RED+F’s PM, User Group leadership and any additional stakeholder(s) of the new space to present the final coordinated security design. The decision for systems cabling responsibility will also be determined at this time.  “As Built” Documentation The Architect shall provide the Security Vendor and Security Department with copies of the finalized “As Built” in electronic form acceptable for import into BuildFlow. 3. General Requirements for Security Design The Architect shall follow the security requirements listed below in the design of the project:  Any code issues,
