Vicki Match Suna, AIA Executive Vice President and Vice Dean Real Estate Development and Facilities NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines INTRODUCTION Real Estate Development and Facilities 3 2023 INTRODUCTION Purpose With over 13 million square feet at locations throughout the New York metropolitan region, NYU Langone Health leases, owns and operates an enormous variety of buildings. The NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines have been created as a guide for architects, interior designers, engineers and Real Estate Development + Facilities Project Managers (PM), etc. to design existing and new facilities. We understand all projects are unique. As such, it is expected the Architectural/Engineering Team (A/E Team) shall take into account existing site conditions, user requirements, building codes, these Design Guidelines, and all other requirements as necessary to design our facilities. In addition, these guidelines are not intended to repeat or replace any code mandated requirements. Compliance with relevant codes is the sole responsibility of the A/E Team. Goals  Efficiency A principal goal of the Design Guidelines is to improve the efficiency of the design process. We can improve operations and maintenance by creating a commonality of systems and products across our expanding portfolio. Where appropriate, approved materials and products are indicated in the guidelines. The aim is not to limit design expression but to guide the architects and engineers toward solutions that are in conformance with our construction and maintenance practices. Improving efficiency in design, construction and operations is of substantial financial benefit to our institution.  Design Excellence and Quality Construction NYU Langone Health is committed to design excellence, and stands by the premise that intelligent planning, inspired design, meticulous documentation, and quality construction are all indispensable to this effort, and will bring added value to our organization. The guidelines have been created in support of this goal. Applicability These guidelines will be updated periodically. The PM on a particular project will advise when new updates are available. Access and Exceptions The Design Guidelines can be accessed on both BuildFlow (the NYU Langone Health construction document management site) and the RED+F website: http://nyulangone.org/vendor supplier information/design guidelines Designers may seek approval of deviations from or alternatives/additions to the Design Guidelines by written request to the PM, who will forward such requests to the RED+F Design Studio for review. The PM will advise the designer in writing whether or not the proposed deviation, alternative or addition is approved. Under no circumstances shall deviation from the Design Guidelines be construed as a basis for additional services.

The physical environment should encourage flexibility and an adaptive environment. 6. NYU Langone Health will be a premier “service” organization that is:  safe  supportive of faculty, clinicians, students, patients and visitors  disease focused  innovative  responsive to market forces and dynamics 7. The faculty response to clinical needs must be fiscally responsible and provide clear direction for expansion over time, as funds become available. 8. Consistent with the NYU Langone mission and as they support strategic areas, innovative methods and technologies will be anticipated and incorporated into clinical programs and practices. 9. All facilities should provide space in support of the educational and training mission of the Medical School and the University. 10. The care that we provide at NYU Langone Health results from a team effort working on behalf of the patient and family. 11. All facilities should embrace sustainable and evidence based parameters in design, materials, equipment and technology. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines DESIGN PRINCIPLES Real Estate Development and Facilities 8 2023 DESIGN PRINCIPLES NYU Langone Health is committed to design excellence and demands the highest quality built environment. We stand by the premise that intelligent planning, inspired design, meticulous documentation and quality construction are all indispensable to this effort. As part of our mission devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research, we have developed the following design principles: 1. Design Quality  Design solutions must be timeless with a clearly organized concept, developed and reinforced with appropriate materials and details.  Provide innovative solutions that create safe, secure and supportive environments and improve workflow.  Develop design solutions that strengthen the NYU Langone brand. 2. Construction Quality  The built environment must have the highest possible quality of construction appropriate to the project scope, budget and schedule. 3. Cost Effectiveness  Design solutions must be cost effective and fiscally responsible. 4. Schedule Compliance  Design and construction schedules must be maintained. 5. Design Flexibility  The physical environment should encourage flexibility and adaptability and provide clear direction for expansion over time. 6. Efficient, Functional and Practical  Designs should look to improve workflow, support efficient, LEAN based operations, and create environments that are easily maintained. 7. Intuitive Wayfinding  The circulation pattern from point of entry to final destination must be clearly visible and easily understood. 8. Durable Materials  Materials and finishes must last over time and be easily maintainable. 9. Attention to Detail  It is critical that details are thoughtfully designed, thoroughly documented and carefully constructed. 10. Collaborative Process  NYU Langone Health promotes an integrated team approach in the development and construction of projects. It is essential that all stakeholders have input in the process. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines GENERAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS Real Estate Development and Facilities 9 2023 GENERAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 1. Architects Agreement Architects are required to execute NYU Langone Health’s Standard Master Owner Architect Agreement (the “Agreement”); no exception may be taken to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between these Design Guidelines and the provisions of the Agreement, the provisions of the Agreement shall govern. 2. Communication and Approach NYU Langone Health promotes a team approach in the development and construction of projects. We believe it is essential that all stakeholders have input into the process. This includes the User, Real Estate Development + Facilities (RED+F), Medical Center Information Technology (MCIT), Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S), Security, Environmental Services/ Building Services, etc. The RED+F Project Manager (PM) will act as the main contact on the project to ensure all elements are coordinated. The Architectural/Engineering team (A/E Team) is encouraged to initiate and sustain open communications throughout the project. All communication with the A/E Team will be handled through their primary contact, the PM. Other contacts listed in this document should only be contacted at the direction of the PM. 3. Roles and Responsibilities The following is a list of NYU Langone departments with whom the A/E Team will likely have regular contact during the planning, design and construction process:  Real Estate Development and Facilities (RED+F) RED+F is the client. They provide planning information as well as architecture and engineering design review for projects. This includes information on related or concurrent projects, NYU Langone practices, policies and space standards. RED+F has a staff of in house architects, engineers and designers that oversee the design of all NYU Langone capital projects.  Sponsor The Sponsor for a capital project is the department or group that is funding the project.  User The User is the department or group that will occupy the project after it is constructed. They have an important responsibility to provide feedback on their functional and programmatic needs, workflow requirements and to sign off on the plan. The plan sign off is a critical schedule milestone that determines when Construction Documents begin and when the Users will be able to move in. The Users will be shown the proposed materials and finishes for the project and be allowed to provide input on functional issues. The aesthetic approval of the finishes will be the sole responsibility of RED+F. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines GENERAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS Real Estate Development and Facilities 10 2023 The following is a list of key project participants with whom the A/E Team will likely have regular contact during the planning, design and construction process:  RED+F Project Manager (PM) The PM is the primary contact for all aspects of the project.

Typically, projects are formulated for approval and are then guided through Design and Construction by an assigned NYU Langone project manager (RED+F PM) who follows a defined process to formulate and implement construction projects based on a specified scope, schedule and budget to meet the goals and needs of all stakeholders. 1. Formulation & Planning  Formulation To ensure that NYU Langone Health’s resources are utilized in the most effective manner, most projects are initiated through Senior Administration. Individual departments can also initiate small department funded projects by contacting RED+F directly. These requests are then reviewed by Senior Administration and, if approved, authorized to proceed. Requests are evaluated based on their importance in supporting NYU Langone Health’s vision and strategic goals, space requirements, staffing requirements, potential impact on other programs, and funding sources.  Planning If Senior Administration determines a requested project merits further investigation, RED+F will do a planning study to identify the project objectives, scope, budget and schedule requirements. This is an iterative process, which attempts to balance project requirements with available resources. Throughout this process, RED+F provides professional assistance to define the primary objective of the project, the specific needs of the user department and the potential solutions. Working with Senior Administration, RED+F then analyzes the options in a campus wide context and establishes target budgets. By identifying key relationships, such as adjacencies to public spaces, utility connections, and potential future uses of the site, broad facility issues can be addressed one project at a time. The best options are re examined and re analyzed until a viable solution is found. For major projects, RED+F will often contract outside consulting firms to work with the user group through a process of defining the project goals, developing the space program, identifying and analyzing options, and budgeting. Throughout this process, RED+F will review the progress with Senior Administration. At the conclusion of the planning study, a formal report is prepared to document the project scope, budget, and schedule for approval by Senior Administration. For small projects, the planning process is similar, but usually less complex and without the involvement of outside consultants.  Approvals During the Formulation Process, RED+F develops a clear statement of project objectives. This statement is incorporated into a final report along with the space program, schedule, and project budget for approval by Senior Administration and to serve as a guide throughout the design process. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 21 2023 All projects move through an approval process to ensure that NYU Langone Health’s resources are managed effectively. The parties involved in the approval process and the number of approvals required varies depending on the project category, the size of the budget, and other considerations. As projects are planned, they are incorporated into a comprehensive capital plan, either as a specific line item or as a broad allowance (pools). The capital plan is developed within the framework of a long term financial plan. Both the capital plan and the financial plan are updated regularly to ensure that the future costs of any planned capital investments are accounted for in the long term financial plan. As projects become more defined, capital and operating budget implications are considered and the capital and financial plans are updated, reviewed and prioritized by NYU Langone Senior Leadership and approved by NYU Langone Health’s Finance Committee. The planning studies prepared in the previous phase not only identify each project's objective, scope, budget, and schedule, but they also include a Project Authorization Form with signature lines for each of the parties responsible for approval. When all signatures on the form are received the project account is established and the design process begins. 2. Design Phase Once approved, a NYU Langone project manager (RED+F PM) is assigned to the project and a project user group is established. Starting with a design kick off meeting, the PM coordinates a series of meetings with the Users and the Project Team to gather information. This group comprising representatives from users, the Design Studio, Facilities Management, MCIT, Senior Administration, architectural and engineering consultants, and the construction manager, if applicable will guide the project through planning and design. Its meetings provide a forum for coordination of the various aspects of the project during the design process.  Schematic Design (SD) This first phase of the design process defines the design parameters and the overall layout. The A/E Team generates schemes based on information gathered from a field investigation (documenting existing conditions) as well as from Users. The PM brings in other NYULH departments (Design Studio, Facilities, MCIT, Infection Prevention and Control, EH&S, Security, etc.) to help inform the design from their perspectives. Schemes are reviewed by all stakeholders and refined accordingly. An estimate will be prepared at the end of this preliminary design phase to verify that the project remains within budget. The budget must be reconciled with scope prior to proceeding with the next phase of design.

There is often heavy User involvement to be sure that the design adheres to their needs. The PM brings in other NYU Langone Health departments (Design Studio, Facilities, MCIT, Infection Prevention and Control, EH&S, Security, etc.) to help inform the design from their perspectives. All key design decisions are made and agreed upon by the end of this phase. The PM works with the A/E Team to keep scope in line with what was initially approved, with the addition of any changes incorporated during preliminary design. The PM must approve any changes to the agreed upon and authorized scope of the project as such changes
