That is more virulent form of M. abscessus! • Since antibiotics generally work against aerobically growing and metabolically active bacteria, treatment is far less successful against the biofilm state• The organism upregulates ten common metabolic pathways, changing the characteristics of the bacteria against which antibiotics have their effectMYCOBACTERIUM ABSCESSUS AND BIOFILMRojony 2020NTM 202028• These changes, including in the composition of the fatty cell wall as well as in the internal workings of the cell, make biofilm dwelling M. abscessus yet harder to deal with medically• Does any of the previously described in vitro Biofilm organism shedding occur as well????M.abscessus and Biofilm NTM 202029BIOFILMNTM 202030• In Europe, soil (indoor and outdoor) is a more prevalent reservoir of MAC than are tap water in North America and bathrooms in Japan• Dust aerosolized in homes in Europe where soil contained MAC grew and aerosolized MAC• Hypothesis: Individuals may carry MAC containing dust from environment to environment• New niches may form in this wayMAC RECOVERY FROM SOILNTM 202031• The infected stay infected• The infected are persistently infected• The infected are repeatedly infectedWorthwhile identifying source of infection NTM: IMPORTANCE OF BETTER PREVENTION• Environmental AND host factors• Water and water vapor involved• Aerosol• BiofilmUncertain which individual exposure(s) and behaviors are most involvedCLEAR THAT BIOFILM IS CENTRAL!!!CONCLUSIONS FOR NOWNTM 202032THANK YOU

How best should the esophageal condition be treated, with a focus on a long term approach? How should we follow our treatment of the esophageal condition to determine if it is making a positive impact on the pulmonary disease?Thank YouContact Information:Abraham Khan, MDOffice: 212 263 3095
