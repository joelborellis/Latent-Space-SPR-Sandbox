the program is not anticipated to include elements that require pre action sprinkler or alternative automatic extinguishing systems. Sprinkler heads will be quick / fast response type throughout, unless not permitted by NYS BC and all applicable standards (extra hazard occupancies) or otherwise not suitable for an application (high temperature spaces). Quantity of sprinkler heads shall be determined based on architectural design. It is anticipated that 211 sprinkler heads will be needed. The new sprinkler system shall be looped, hydraulically sized for a density of 0.10 GPM over a hydraulically remote area of 1,500 square feet as defined in NFPA for a light hazard occupancy area such as office areas, toilet rooms and pantry areas. Storage and mechanical room areas will be sized for ordinary hazard and hydraulically sized for a density of 0.15 GPM over a hydraulically remote area of 1,500 square feet. Concealed type sprinklers will be provided in areas with ceilings. Upright sprinklers will be provided in areas without ceilings such as the mechanical spaces. In areas where exposed ductwork or fixed obstructions are located; sprinklers will be provided above and below objects exceeding 48” in width per NFPA requirements. Describe existing and or new work for fire detection, alarm, and communication systems: Fire Alarm: Existing fire alarm devices are limited to just wall & ceiling mounted speaker strobes, smoke detectors and pull stations at the exit stairs. Existing fire alarm system is an addressable temporal 3 automatic and manual fire alarm system with central office connection, manufactured by Edwards, EST 3 systems. Building fire alarm vendor is Casey Fire Systems. All new fire alarm devices shall be Edwards or System Sensor and compatible with existing building EST 3 fire alarm system. New ceiling mounted smoke detectors will be installed inside each public space/room and above smoke compartments with remote LED indicators as per Nassau County Fire Marshal requirements. Outside elevator landings for recall elevators. New fire smoke dampers for wall rating protection will be provided with duct smoke detectors and control modules tied into fire alarm system for open/close functions. Control modules with addressable load relays to assure required fire safety operations such as ventilation unit shutdown greater than 2,000cfm and egress door release. Above ceiling smoke detectors shall be provided at all new mechanical equipment installed in the building since the shared return air plenum is over 2,000cfm. All units will be powered off via relays during fire alarm condition. Existing water flow alarm switches and tamper switches will be re used and interfaced with the sprinkler system. Carbon monoxide detectors equipped with sounding bases and visible notification will be provided within rooms containing carbon monoxide producing equipment and on the public corridor of the floor in alarm. Audible annunciation devices (horns) will be located in common spaces such as corridors, open offices and lobbies. Visible annunciation devices (strobes) will be located in common spaces such as corridors, open offices, lobbies, exam rooms, public restrooms, and conference rooms. If a hospital or nursing home located in a flood zone, provide a FEMA BFE Certificate from www.fema.gov, and describe the work to mitigate damage and maintain operations during a flood event.
