Vicki Match Suna, AIA Executive Vice President and Vice Dean Real Estate Development and Facilities NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines INTRODUCTION Real Estate Development and Facilities 3 2024 INTRODUCTION Purpose With over 143 million square feet at locations throughout the New York metropolitan region, NYU Langone Health leases, owns and operates an enormous variety of buildings. The NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines have been created as a guide for architects, interior designers, engineers and Real Estate Development + Facilities Project Managers (PM), etc. to design existing and new facilities. We understand all projects are unique. As such, it is expected the Architectural/Engineering Team (A/E Team) shall take into account existing site conditions, user requirements, building codes, these Design Guidelines, and all other requirements as necessary to design our facilities. In addition, these guidelines are not intended to repeat or replace any code mandated requirements. Compliance with relevant codes is the sole responsibility of the A/E Team. Goals  Efficiency A principal goal of the Design Guidelines is to improve the efficiency of the design process. We can improve operations and maintenance by creating a commonality of systems and products across our expanding portfolio. Where appropriate, approved materials and products are indicated in the guidelines. The aim is not to limit design expression but to guide the architects and engineers toward solutions that are in conformance with our construction and maintenance practices. Improving efficiency in design, construction and operations is of substantial financial benefit to our institution.  Design Excellence and Quality Construction NYU Langone Health is committed to design excellence, and stands by the premise that intelligent planning, inspired design, meticulous documentation, and quality construction are all indispensable to this effort, and will bring added value to our organization. The guidelines have been created in support of this goal. Applicability These guidelines will be updated periodically. The PM on a particular project will advise when new updates are available. Access and Exceptions The Design Guidelines can be accessed on both BuildFlow (the NYU Langone Health construction document management site) and the RED+F website: https://nyulangone.org/vendor supplier information/real estate development facilities design guidelineshttp://nyulangone.org/vendor supplier information/design guidelines Designers may seek approval of deviations from or alternatives/additions to the Design Guidelines by written request to the PM, who will forward such requests to the RED+F Design Studio for review.

Typically, projects are formulated for approval and are then guided through Design and Construction by an assigned NYU Langone project manager (RED+F PM) who follows a defined process to formulate and implement construction projects based on a specified scope, schedule and budget to meet the goals and needs of all stakeholders. 1. Formulation & Planning  Formulation To ensure that NYU Langone Health’s resources are utilized in the most effective manner, most projects are initiated through Senior Administration. Individual departments can also initiate small department funded projects by contacting RED+F directly. These requests are then reviewed by Senior Administration and, if approved, authorized to proceed. Requests are evaluated based on their importance in supporting NYU Langone Health’s vision and strategic goals, space requirements, staffing requirements, potential impact on other programs, and funding sources.  Planning If Senior Administration determines a requested project merits further investigation, RED+F will do a planning study to identify the project objectives, scope, budget and schedule requirements. This is an iterative process, which attempts to balance project requirements with available resources. Throughout this process, RED+F provides professional assistance to define the primary objective of the project, the specific needs of the user department and the potential solutions. Working with Senior Administration, RED+F then analyzes the options in a campus wide context and establishes target budgets. By identifying key relationships, such as adjacencies to public spaces, utility connections, and potential future uses of the site, broad facility issues can be addressed one project at a time. The best options are re examined and re analyzed until a viable solution is found. For major projects, RED+F will often contract outside consulting firms to work with the user group through a process of defining the project goals, developing the space program, identifying and analyzing options, and budgeting. Throughout this process, RED+F will review the progress with Senior Administration. At the conclusion of the planning study, a formal report is prepared to document the project scope, budget, and schedule for approval by Senior Administration. For small projects, the planning process is similar, but usually less complex and without the involvement of outside consultants.  Approvals During the Formulation Process, RED+F develops a clear statement of project objectives. This statement is incorporated into a final report along with the space program, schedule, and project budget for approval by Senior Administration and to serve as a guide throughout the design process. All projects move through an approval process to ensure that NYU Langone Health’s resources are managed effectively. The parties involved in the approval process and the NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 23 2024 number of approvals required varies depending on the project category, the size of the budget, and other considerations. As projects are planned, they are incorporated into a comprehensive capital plan, either as a specific line item or as a broad allowance (pools). The capital plan is developed within the framework of a long term financial plan.
