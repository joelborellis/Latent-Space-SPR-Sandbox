Community Health Needs and Assets Assessment:2021 2022 Hempstead VillageNassau County, Long IslandCommunity Health Needs and Assets Assessment Process A Community Health Needs and Assets Assessment (CHNAA) is a way to understand the healthof a community by reviewing data and information from community members about theirhealth needs and priorities. That data and information can then be used to help shapeprograms to address those concerns and to reduce inequities.NYU Langone Hospital Long Island (formerly known as Winthrop University Hospital andearlier as Nassau Hospital) has served communities across Nassau and Suffolk Counties since1896. Every three years we are required to do a Community Health Needs and AssetsAssessment and develop a plan, called a Community Service Plan, to identify communitypriorities and implement programs to address these needs. Residents from Hempstead (Incorporated Village of Hempstead) utilize services at NYULangone Hospital Long Island. We wanted to better understand how we can best serve theHempstead community as part of our 2022 2024 Community Service Plan.The best way to understand the needs, priorities, and assets of a community is to havecommunity partners and residents help design and implement the process for assessing needsand assets. Beginning in July 2021, local community based organizations and NYULangone faculty and staff held monthly meetings to identify what is known and whatinformation is missing about community health needs, assets, and priorities. The groupreviewed available data, interviewed individual staff and community members, and hostedsix group discussions with thirty seven participants. This report summarizes the findings from the needs and assets assessment. The numbers usedin this report are based on a snapshot from the most recent year of data available. These dataalone cannot explain why these patterns exist or how they are affected by the legacies ofstructural racism and community disinvestment. The numbers alone do not tell the wholestory of the community.
