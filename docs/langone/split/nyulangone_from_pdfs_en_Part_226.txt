1WelcomeWe can discuss your payment options with you after the doctors tell us that your condition is stable.Your care from the ED to discharge could include: • Treat and ReleaseIf you do not need more emergency care, the doctors and nurses will speak with you to prepare you for discharge. You will then be discharged from the ED.• Observation We will transfer you to a unit for observation to determine if you need inpatient care. While you are in observation status, we may perform tests to help us make a diagnosis. If you require additional treatment, you may be transferred for inpatient or outpatient care.• Outpatient As an outpatient, you will be transferred from the ED to another unit for quick recovery. If you need additional care, you may be admitted as an inpatient.• Inpatient If you need the level of care that requires several days in the hospital, you will be admitted as an inpatient. When a bed is ready, we will take you to the clinical unit. While you’re in the Emergency Department (ED), our top priority is to assess your condition, provide you the care you need, and determine next steps for treatment. To progress your treatment, you may be moved from the ED to another unit for observation, outpatient care, or inpatient care. Even if you are moved from the ED to another bed, you may not be an inpatient. Please ask your care team if you have any questions about your care. 3What you should knowTell us if your pain isn’t improving.Help us help you manage your pain by sharing details of your pain with us.Call, don’t fall!Please ask for help to get out of bed.DenturesHearing AidEyeglassesCell PhoneKeysBe worry free, send your valuables home.These items often get lost.
