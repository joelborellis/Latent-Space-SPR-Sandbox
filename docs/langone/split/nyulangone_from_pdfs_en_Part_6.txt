Actual actions or results may differ materially from those discussed below. Specific factors that might cause such differenc­es include competition from other healthcare facilities in the service area of NYU Langone Health’s facilities, federal and state regulation of healthcare providers, and reimbursement policies of the state and federal governments and managed care organizations. In particular, statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “in­tends,” “scheduled” or other similar expressions are or may constitute forward looking statements. To the extent forward looking statements are included in this quarterly report, NYU Langone Health undertakes no obligation to update such statements.Financial Planning and Budgetary ProcessNYU Langone Health’s capital and operating budgets are developed annually beginning several months before the start of each fiscal year. Based on initial estimates by department managers and the targets developed within the Long Range Financial Plan (“LRFP”), NYU Langone Health’s Finance Department creates budgets that are reviewed by senior management. The LRFP and the capital and operating budgets are then reviewed by NYU Langone Health’s Finance Committee and presented to the NYU Langone Hospitals and NYU Langone Health System Board of Trustees for approval; approval of the NYU Langone Hospitals’ budgets rests with the Board of Trustees of NYU Langone Hospitals in compliance with New York State Department of Health regulations. NYU Langone Health’s budgets are also reviewed by New York University, the sole member of NYU Lan­gone Health System, and New York University’s Board of Trustees approves the budgets for the two medical schools. Financial performance is monitored by the NYU Langone Health Finance Commit­tee and the Board of Trustees.Organizational Structure“NYU Langone Health” represents the combined activities of NYU Langone Health System (“NYULH System”) and its affiliates, NYU Langone Hospitals and certain components of New York University, which include the NYU Robert I. Grossman School of Medicine (“NYUGSOM”) and the NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine (“NYUGLISOM”) (collectively the “NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine”). NYULH System is a subsidiary of New York University (“NYU”) and is the sole corporate member of NYU Langone Hospitals, Long Island Community Hospital at NYU Lan­gone Health (d/b/a Long Island Community Hospital) (“LICH”), Brookhaven Health Care Services Corporation (d/b/a Long Island Community Hospital Foundation) (the “Foundation”), and other related organizations. NYU Langone Hospitals is the sole obligated entity (“the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group”) with respect to the outstanding bonds and other obligations under the NYU Langone Hospitals Master Trust Indenture (the “NYU Langone Hospitals Master Indenture”). None of NYULH System, NYUGSOM, NYUGLISOM, LICH, the Foundation, or NYU is obligated with respect to obligations secured under the NYU Langone Hospitals Master Indenture.LICH is a not for profit acute care hospital located in Suffolk County, New York, and the Foundation is a not for profit corporation among whose purposes is to support the mission of LICH, including the solicitation of funds. The Foundation is guarantor of LICH’s outstanding bonds (as is NYU Lan­gone Hospitals as described within the Affiliation with LICH and the Foundation section) issued by NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORTthe Town of Brookhaven Local Development Corporation, specifically such issuer’s Revenue Bonds, Long Island Community Hospital Project, Series 2020 (the “LICH Bonds”). LICH is the sole obligat­ed entity (“the LICH Obligated Group”) relating to the LICH Bonds. LICH and the Foundation are referred to jointly in this report as the “LICH Credit Group”.NYU Langone Hospitals, LICH, and other related organizations of the NYULH System, have no obligation with respect to the outstanding indebtedness of NYU, including obligations of the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine.This quarterly disclosure for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 rep­resents a new disclosure format for NYU Langone Hospitals and LICH. Previously, separate disclo­sures were prepared by management for each of the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group and the LICH Credit Group. Starting with this quarterly disclosure, continuing disclosure requirements for the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group and the LICH Obligated Group will be satisfied utilizing this combined NYU Langone Health consolidated disclosure report, which contains both stand alone obligated group financial statements and operating data, and consolidating financial statements and operating data necessary to satisfy each of the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group and the LICH Obligated Group continuing disclosure requirements. Executive Leadership UpdateOn June 12, 2024, Robert I. Grossman, MD announced his plans to retire as CEO of NYU Langone Health and Dean of NYU Grossman School of Medicine at the end of August 2025. A formal national search for Dr. Grossman’s successor has commenced. Kenneth G. Langone also announced that he will step down from his position as chair of the NYU Langone Board of Trustees at the end of August 2025, but will remain a member of the Board of Trustees. Fiona Druckenmiller will succeed Mr. Lan­gone as Chair of the NYU Langone Board of Trustees. A member of the Board since 2006, including serving the past seven years as a co chair, Ms. Druckenmiller is a business leader who serves on multiple corporate boards and has made numerous transformational gifts to NYU Langone Health. These leadership transitions follow years of careful succession planning to ensure NYU Langone Health is fully prepared for this transition.Merger with Long Island Community Hospital at NYU Langone Health (“LICH”)On April 26, 2024, a certificate of need (“CON”) application was submitted to the New York State Department of Health (“NYS DOH”) for the full asset merger of Long Island Community Hospital at NYU Langone Health (“LICH”) with and into NYU Langone Hospitals, with NYU Langone Hospitals as the surviving corporation. The NYS DOH approved the CON on September 13, 2024. The antici­pated date of merger is March 1, 2025, pending receipt of all regulatory and corporate approvals.Rating UpgradeIn January 2024, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded NYU Langone Hospitals’ revenue bonds to A1 from A2 and revised the outlook to stable from positive at the higher rating level.

Guided by its purpose to deliver the best outcomes in patient care, education, and science, its more than 51,000 staff members aim to consistently provide life changing care, innovative medical education, and groundbreaking advances in research. NYU Langone Health’s mission to care, to teach, and to discover is achieved daily through a culture of exceptionalism. Its values of performance, respect, integrity, diversity, and excellence influence the way its staff members show up each and every day for its patients, students, and communities.NYU Langone Hospitals has achieved the highest quality recognition from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Ser­vices and Leapfrog, and has been named No. 1 in Quality and Safety by Vizient, Inc. All NYU Langone Health hospi­tals have been accredited by The Joint Commission. NYU Langone Health is home to 13 top ranked specialties in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report. NYU Langone Hospitals are Magnet designated for excel­lence in nursing and quality patient care from the Amer­ican Nurses Credentialing Center, an honor achieved by only 9. of hospitals in the United States. The Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center is designated a Compre­hensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), its highest recognition of achievement. Rusk Rehabilitation is consis­tently ranked one of the top 10 rehabilitation programs in the country by U.S. News & World Report.Groundbreaking MedicineIn addition to providing its patients top quality and safety outcomes, NYU Langone Health’s clinicians and research­ers have set new standards for the diagnosis and treat­ment of diseases and have made or contributed to break­throughs in biomedical science.In 2015, a team of surgeons led by Eduardo D. Rodriguez, MD, DDS, the Helen L. Kimmel Professor of Reconstruc­tive Plastic Surgery and chair of NYU Langone’s Hansjörg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery, performed the most extensive face transplant to date, followed in 2020 by the world’s first successful face and double hand transplant and in 2023 by the world’s first whole eye and partial face transplant.In 2021, a team of surgeons led by Robert Montgomery, MD, DPhil, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Insti­tute, the H. Leon Pachter, MD, Professor of Surgery, and chair of the Department of Surgery, performed the first investigational transplant of a kidney grown in a genetical­ly altered pig to a person with complete and irreversible loss of all brain function, whose bodily functions were sus­tained by mechanical support. In separate investigational procedures performed in June and July 2022, surgeons led by Dr. Montgomery successfully transplanted hearts from genetically altered pigs into brain dead patients, marking the latest advance toward addressing the nation­wide organ shortage and developing a clinical protocol that would provide an alternative supply of organs for people with life threatening heart disease. In April 2024, surgeons performed the first combined mechanical heart pump and gene edited pig kidney transplant surgery. The heart pump was surgically implanted days before the surgery to transplant a gene edited pig kidney and a pig’s thymus gland to aid against rejection. It is only the second transplant of a gene edited pig kidney into a living person and the first with the thymus combined.Transforming Medical EducationNYUGSOM has spearheaded innovations that have not only transformed the training of medical students, but also inspired educational reforms at other medical schools nationwide. In 2013, NYUGSOM began offering an accelerated three year MD degree for select medical students, an initiative designed to ease the financial burden of medical school and launch medical careers one year earlier than tradi­tional students. The program made NYU Langone Health the first nationally ranked academic medical center in the United States to enable graduates to pursue a career in ei­ther primary care or the medical specialty of their choice in three years.Then, in 2018—and through a groundswell of generosity from hundreds of alumni, trustees, and other scholar­ship supporters—NYUGSOM once again made history. NYUGSOM became the first top ranked medical school in the nation to provide full tuition scholarships to all new and current students, a strategy aimed at reducing the staggering debt incurred by medical students due to the ever rising cost of their education. The following year, NYU School of Medicine was renamed NYU Grossman School of Medicine in honor of the landmark educational achieve­ments and visionary leadership of Robert I. Grossman, MD, which vaulted the school to national renown. Today, one in six medical school applicants nationwide set their sights on NYUGSOM.In 2019, NYU Langone Health expanded its medical stu­dent training when it launched NYUGLISOM. The school, which also provides full tuition scholarships, is the only accelerated three year MD program focused on primary care in New York State.Leaders in ResearchNYU Langone Health is setting the pace as the fastest NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT2growing research enterprise within a top 20 medical school. NYUGSOM is a highly productive research intensive school of medicine, with active awards per researcher currently higher than any other top 20 medical school. Its team of 1,190 principal investigators has amassed a portfolio of NIH funding that has grown from $129 million in 2007, to $820 million in 2024. In 2021, NYUGSOM was selected by the NIH to be the Clinical Science Core of the Researching COVID to Enhance Re­covery (RECOVER) Initiative and received a $450 million parent award. Since then, NYU Langone Health has success­fully constructed the RECOVER Consortium, making multiple subawards to a network of lead investigators studying the long term effects of COVID 19 at 33 institutions across the nation. These researchers coordinate data, monitor proto­cols, and guide communications with patients and clinicians.Financial HighlightsNYU Langone Health(unaudited)For the twelve months endedchange from prior period($ in millions)August 31, 2024August 31, 2023$%Operating revenue $14,173.5 $12,414.9 $1,758.614.Operating gain 431.4 358.8 72.6 20.Operating margin3.2.The above Rankings and Honors exclude LICH.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 3NYU Langone Health represents the combined operations of NYU Langone Hospitals, the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine, LICH, and other NYULH System related organizations.

NYU is a separate borrowing entity and NYU Langone Hospitals is not responsible for the indebt­edness of the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine. NYU, through NYUGSOM, employs nearly 3,900 faculty physi­cians who form the division known as the Faculty Group Practice (“FGP”). FGP physicians deliver patient care at more than 300 ambulatory locations in the New York metropolitan area and two practice locations in Delray Beach and West Palm Beach, Florida. These physicians constitute the principal clinical service providers for NYU Langone Hospitals’ facilities and are connected by NYU Langone Health’s enterprise wide electronic medical record system, Epic.On March 1, 2022, pursuant to the terms of an Affiliation Agreement (the “Affiliation Agreement”), NYULH System became the sole corporate member of LICH, an acute care hospital licensed to operate 306 beds located in Suffolk County, and the Foundation (the “Affiliation”). LICH and the Foundation each remain separate corpora­tions, responsible for their own respective liabilities and obligations. As a result of the Affiliation Agreement, and beginning on March 1, 2022, LICH changed its name from Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Inc. to LICH and changed its fiscal year from a calendar year to a fiscal year beginning September 1 and ending August 31 to align with the fiscal year of the NYULH System. It is expected that LICH will merge with and into NYU Langone Hospitals effective March 1, 2025, pending the receipt of all necessary corporate and regulatory approvals.Refer to the “Affiliation with LICH and the Foundation” section for additional considerations regarding the Affilia­tion Agreement and LICH’s outstanding indebtedness.For the twelve months ended and as of August 31, 2024, NYU Langone Health reported operating revenues of $14.2 billion and total assets of $21.2 billion.

Furthermore, within the NYU Langone Health operating margin for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 is the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group gain of $750.0 million for an operating margin of 7.; the LICH Obligated Group loss of $16.8 million for an operating margin of 4.; and the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine loss of $303.4 million for an operating margin of 5.. Within the NYU Langone Health operating mar­gin for the twelve months ended August 31, 2023, is the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group gain of $686.3 million for an operating margin of 8.; the LICH Obligat­ed Group loss of $47.4 million for an operating margin of 17.; and the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine loss of $273.7 million for an operating margin of 5.. Refer to the “Obligated Group Financial Highlights” and “Finan­cial Statements” sections for the metrics and financial statements of the obligated groups.For the twelve months ended August 31, 2024, NYU Langone Health recorded total revenue of $14.2 billion: 30. from inpatient operations; 28. from outpatient operations; 19. from FGP patient services; and 22. from other sources. As compared to the twelve months ended August 31, 2023, total revenue increased by $1.8 billion or by 14.. Management attributes the increase to a 6. increase in inpatient discharges and a 6. in­crease in outpatient visits. Management further attributes a portion of the increase to pharmacy revenue, which increased by $184.1 million or by 26. over the prior comparable period.(unaudited)For the twelve months endedchange from prior period($ in thousands)August 31, 2024August 31, 2023$%NYU Langone HealthOperating revenue$ 14,173,508 $ 12,414,924 $ 1,758,584 14.Operating expenses 13,742,072 12,056,135 1,685,937 14.Gain from operations$ 431,436 $358,789 $ 72,647 20.Operating margin %3.2.NYU Langone HospitalsOperating revenue$ 9,546,770 $ 8,337,715 $ 1,209,055 14.Operating expenses 8,796,816 7,651,460 1,145,356 15.Gain from operations$ $749,954 $ 686,255 $ 63,699 9.Operating margin %7.8.NYU Grossman Schools of MedicineOperating revenue$ 5,949,248 $ 5,195,114 $ 754,134 14.Operating expenses 6,252,614 5,468,848 783,766 14.Gain from operations$ (303,366)$ (273,734)$ (29,632)10.Operating margin % 5. 5.Results from OperationsNYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 9In January 2024, CMS issued a settlement payment to NYU Langone Hospitals totaling $122.3 million (the “CMS Settlement”) to remedy invalidated Outpatient Prospective Payment System 340B acquired drug payment policy for calendar years 2018 through September 2022. The CMS Settlement is recorded within Other Items, outside of the gain from operations but within the performance indicator on the Statement of Operations. Given both the materiality of the settlement payment as well as the time periods to which the settlement relates, including the settlement as part of net patient service revenue would distort fiscal year 2024 operating results. Accordingly, the revenues referenced above for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024, exclude the CMS Settle­ment.For the twelve months ended August 31, 2024, NYU Langone Health recorded total operating expenses of $13.7 billion: 60. salaries and benefits; 32. pharmaceutical, medical, and other supplies; 6. depreciation and amortization; and 1. interest. As compared to the twelve months ended August 31, 2023, total operating expenses increased by $1.7 billion or 14.. Management attributes the increase primarily to increases in salaries and wages as well as phar­macy costs and medical supplies, which were offset by increased pharmacy and patient service revenue, as described above.For the twelve months ended August 31, 2024, the increase in the change in net assets without donor restrictions was $890.5 million, primarily attributable to a gain from operations of $431.4 million, investment return of $208.5 million, the CMS settlement of $122.3 million, revenue recognized for FEMA capital awards totaling $50.4 million, net assets re­leased for capital expenditures of $38.7 million, actuarial gains from pension and post retirement plans of $13.2 million, and other items.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT10Summarized Balance SheetsAs of August 31, 2024, cash and investments totaled $5.0 billion, an increase of $317.4 million or 6. as compared to August 31, 2023. The increase in cash and investments from August 31, 2023 is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations of $1.0 billion, a $532.6 million increase from investment gains, and receipt of the CMS settlement payment of $122.3 million. These increases were partially offset by expenditures of $1.2 billion to sup­port NYU Langone Health’s capital investments. Assets limited as to use increased $234.9 million from $1.7 billion at August 31, 2023 to $1.9 billion at August 31, 2024, primarily attributable to growth in assets held by CCC550 from investment gains and new premiums invested, as well as investment gains and contributions of $78.7 million in 457(b) plan assets. This growth was partially offset by the release of funds held by the Bond Trustee for the DASNY Series 2020A tax exempt bonds to reimburse NYU Langone Hospitals for eligible capital costs incurred for the projects financed under the DASNY Series 2020A tax exempt bonds.The days revenue in patient accounts receivable (“Days in AR”) was 57 days as of August 31, 2024, which is an increase of 5 days since August 31, 2023. Management attributes this increase to growth in patient accounts re­ceivable, primarily driven by growth in net patient service revenue as previously described. Other assets decreased $32.5 million from $1,367.7 mil­lion at August 31, 2023 to $1,335.2 million at August 31, 2024. The decrease is primarily driven by a $50.4 million receivable recorded for two project worksheets from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) to reimburse eligible expenses related to the COVID 19 pandemic where funds were approved by FEMA for the reimbursement of submitted eligible expenses and trans­ferred to New York State. In October 2024, NYU Langone Health received a $48.6 million payment in satisfaction of one of the obligated project worksheets. While the COVID 19 public health emergency ended in May 2023, NYU Langone Health continues to pursue reimbursement of eligible operating expenses through the submission of additional FEMA project worksheets; however, future amounts awarded cannot be determined at this time. This increase is offset by a $31.5 million reduction in contribu­tions receivable, a $31.4 million goodwill write off, and a $9.6 million reduction in intercompany balances due from affiliated entities, and miscellaneous other items.NYU Langone HealthSummarized Balance Sheets(unaudited)(unaudited)($ in thousands)August 31, 2024August 31, 2023Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,621,379 $ 403,339 Investments 3,427,087 4,327,721 Assets limited as to use 1,913,803 1,678,948 Patient accounts receivable, net 1,532,383 1,223,088 Operating lease right of use assets 1,572,334 1,497,096 Property, plant and equipment, net 9,718,126 9,323,599 Other assets 1,335,155 1,367,703 Total assets $ 21,120,267 $ 19,821,494 Liabilities and net assetsAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 970,939 $ 803,480 Accrued salaries and related liabilities 842,420 827,207 Operating lease liabilities 1,743,553 1,647,855 Accrued pension and postretirement liabilities 357,702 402,538 Long term debt5,529,525 5,687,113 Other liabilities2,262,756 2,103,174 Total liabilities 11,706,895 11,471,367 Net assets 9,413,372 8,350,127 Total liabilities and net assets $ 21,120,267 $ 19,821,494 NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 11Affiliation with LICH and the FoundationAs noted above, LICH and the Foundation became affili­ated with NYU Langone Health in March 2022 when the NYULH System became the sole corporate member of LICH and the Foundation. Each of LICH and the Founda­tion remain separate corporations, responsible for their own respective liabilities and obligations, including their obligations with respect to the Town of Brookhaven Local Development Corporation Revenue Bonds, Long Island Community Hospital Project, Series 2020 (the “LICH Bonds”). In January 2023, NYU Langone Hospitals provid­ed an unsecured guaranty of the LICH Bonds (the “NYU Langone Guaranty”). The NYU Langone Guaranty is an unsecured, general obligation of NYU Langone Hospitals and is not secured by any obligation issued under the NYU Langone Hospitals Master Indenture. The Foundation’s guaranty of the LICH Bonds also remains in effect. LICH and the Foundation have no obligation with respect to the outstanding obligations of NYU Langone Hospitals.The Affiliation Agreement provides that NYULH System will make at least $100 million of capital investments (including information technology) at LICH. Through Au­gust 31, 2024, NYULH System has made $103.7 million in capital investments at LICH under the Affiliation. Since the Affiliation in March 2022, NYU Langone Health has helped LICH to augment staffing levels, implement new clinical services and surgical sub specialties intended to increase volume, and continue to build out a clinically integrated healthcare network in eastern Long Island, including ambulatory facilities and physician practices. The governing bodies of NYU Langone Hospitals, LICH, and the NYULH System have determined that implement­ing the full asset merger of LICH with and into NYU Lan­gone Hospitals will further enhance patient care. To that end, and as previously noted, on September 13, 2024, the CON application for the full asset merger of LICH with and into NYU Langone Hospitals was approved by the NYS DOH. Upon the merger, LICH will cease to exist as a sep­arate entity. The NYULH System will continue in its role as the sole member and passive parent of NYU Langone Hospitals, and NYU will continue to be the sole corporate member and passive parent of the NYULH System. The LICH campus will be doing business as NYU Langone Hospital Suffolk and will be operated as a division of NYU Langone Hospitals, along with the Kimmel Pavilion, Tisch Hospital, NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital, NYU Langone Brooklyn, and NYU Langone Long Island. Follow­ing the full asset merger of LICH, NYU Langone Health anticipates that the Foundation will continue to exist as a separate legal entity, with the NYULH System as its sole member, to support the mission of NYU Langone Hospi­tals and will continue to guarantee the outstanding LICH Bonds.In addition to this CON, an application was also submitted to the New York State Office of Addiction Services and Support (“OASAS”) for NYU Langone Hospitals to be­come the licensed operator of LICH’s existing substance abuse services. OASAS granted NYU Langone Hospitals contingent approval on September 12, 2024. An Easy Prior Approval Review application was also submitted for approval by the New York State Office of Mental Health for NYU Langone Hospitals to be able to provide mental health services at this location.Liquidity and InvestmentsNYU Langone Health maintains a laddered portfolio of U.S. Treasury bills, Certificates of Deposit, money market funds, and interest bearing cash balances to support operating cash flows while also optimizing yield. Cash and cash equiva­lents increased by $1.2 billion from August 31, 2023, arising from a strategic shift from U.S. Treasuries to cash deposits offering higher yields and the result of shortening the duration of investments in U.S. Treasuries to securities with ma­turities of 90 days or less. NYU Langone Health’s policy defines cash equivalents as highly liquid financial instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. NYU Langone Health’s investments consist of only liquid secu­rities, including short term U.S. Treasury bills and publicly traded equities.In addition to the above sources of liquidity, NYU Langone Health, leveraging the credit of NYU Langone Hospitals, maintains five lines of credit at five commercial banks with an aggregate available balance of $718.8 million. As of August 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding on these lines of credit. All five lines of credit reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as a benchmark.PhilanthropyNYU Langone Health performs fundraising and reports philanthropic contributions on a combined basis and received total cash contributions of $256.0 million in the twelve months ended August 31, 2024, of which $115.4 million was allocable to NYU Langone Hospitals, and $202.6 million in fiscal year 2023, of which $68.0 million was allocable to NYU Langone Hospitals.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT12Medical School PaymentsNYU Langone Hospitals and the NYULH System provide support for the clinical, research, and education missions of the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine, including costs related to the expansion of FGP clinical programs. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2024, NYU Lan­gone Hospitals and the NYULH System provided support of $1.2 billion, which is recorded in supplies and other expenses within the Statement of Operations. Of this to­tal, $926.4 million is in support of the clinical mission and the remaining $231.6 million supports the research and education missions. This is an increase of $29.5 million or 3. more than the comparable prior period of $896.9 million. The increase in the level of support is reflective of the growth of these missions. Support provided is recorded as an operating expense to the NYULH System and operating revenue to the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine which eliminate upon combination in the NYU Langone Health Statements of Operations.NYU Langone Hospitals views the strength and scale of the FGP as critical to the accomplishment of NYU Langone Hospitals’ quality and strategic goals. The FGP employs the physicians constituting 71. of the active medical staff of NYU Langone Hospitals, and NYU Lan­gone Hospitals believes that attracting and retaining the highest quality clinical staff depends in part on the vibran­cy of the research and teaching programs and the overall depth and scale of the FGP. The FGP has expanded into Long Island and other areas, and the historic level of sub­sidy to the FGP for joint program support has continued to grow. While establishing new practices and expanding existing practices has resulted in additional support costs, the associated physician recruitment and capital spend­ing will build a reliable network of high quality providers broadening the range of services available to the sur­rounding communities. Although NYU Langone Hospitals is not obligated to increase funding to the NYU Grossman Schools of Medi­cine, management anticipates that given the close inter­connection between NYU Langone Hospitals and the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine, and the importance of the FGP to NYU Langone Hospitals’ strategic plans, NYU Langone Hospitals may decide to increase future funding to the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine and will con­tinue to offset any deficit in the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine’s cash flows from operations. Management anticipates that cash flows for capital spending and other non operating needs will be funded through additional equity transfers from NYU Langone Hospitals to the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine. All such transfers would be made in accordance with the requirements of the NYU Langone Hospitals Master Indenture.In addition to the support described above, NYU Langone Hospitals has committed to provide annual mission sup­port to NYUGSOM for joint clinical, research, and teaching programs of $50.0 million per year. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2024, NYU Langone Hospitals trans­ferred $50.0 million of the 2024 budgeted mission pay­ment to NYUGSOM.Major Construction ProjectsManagement is developing long range plans for NYU Langone Long Island that are currently anticipated to include de­velopment of a new inpatient hospital campus in Nassau County over the next ten years. This significant development is dependent upon site acquisition, as well as internal and external approvals, and is subject to market conditions and other factors. Plans for Long Island also include the development of other sites across Long Island. In Patchogue, construction is underway on a new 54,000 square foot ambulatory surgery and multi specialty center. An adaptive re use of a former department store on Main Street, the site will include physician practices for gastroen­terology, urology, and colorectal care in addition to four operating rooms and two endoscopy/procedure rooms. The facility is expected to open to patients in late 2025.In Manhasset, work is ongoing on another adaptive re use of a former department store at 1440 Northern Boulevard to become a new three story ambulatory care hub that will include ambulatory surgery, endoscopy, comprehensive imaging, and multi specialty physician practices including orthopedic, pulmonary, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal care. The project is approximately 162,000 square feet and will yield 72 exam rooms, six endoscopy rooms, and eight operating rooms with 42 recovery bays. Both the endoscopy and operating suites will be Article 28 licensed. The facility is expected to open to patients in 2026.On the main Manhattan campus, major renovation projects are underway at the Medical Science Building, the Schwartz Health Care Center, and at 540 First Avenue.•The Medical Science Building is being renovated for both hospital operations space as well as for an ex­pansion and modernization of research space. Over 100,000 square feet of the building is being renovated across the north and south wings on all floors, and the existing building infrastructure is being fully mod­ernized.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 13AffiliationsFrom time to time, NYU Langone Hospitals may consider affiliating with other acute care hospitals if NYU Langone Hospitals believes it would further its mission. No letters of intent or other binding documents have been executed with other hospitals in connection with potential affiliations.•The Schwartz Health Care Center is being renovated, which will include the construction of a new compre­hensive heart center, including space for an expanded transplant program. The project also seeks to posi­tion several outpatient services together that were previously scattered over several locations. This update will serve to streamline efficiency and improve patient experience, particularly for patients seeing multiple specialty physicians or surgeons or receiving multiple treatments. The total project area is over 100,000 square feet.•The research floors at 540 First Avenue have been re imagined. Construction is near completion, with phased occupancy scheduled to begin before the end of the calendar year on the full scale renovation of over 150,000 square feet of laboratory and associated mechanical equipment floors. With a focus on col­laboration, the laboratory floors will feature both visual and physician connectivity between offices and wet laboratories, and a variety of meeting and interactive spaces. A new entry sequence includes re oriented connecting stairs and custom two story art walls. The design emphasizes natural light, connectivity, and scientific collaboration with an efficient layout allowing each of the four floors to host up to ten principal investigators and 72 researchers, as well as various specialty research and laboratory support spaces.At NYU Langone Orthopedic Center at 338 East 38th Street, a 265,000 square foot major renovation is underway which will expand the clinical footprint by 187,000 square feet. This project will provide 18 new operating rooms, 72 prep/recovery bays, as well as a 65,000 square foot expansion of orthopedic outpatient programs. The renovation in­cludes a comprehensive replacement and upgrade of the building’s mechanical, electrical, and plumbing infrastructure.In Brooklyn, foundation work is nearing completion and construction has started on a new 120,000 square foot am­bulatory hub. This ground up development is located immediately adjacent to the hospital, and will house ambulatory surgery, FGP physician offices, and a clinic for the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone (“FHC”). The project will yield four endoscopy rooms with 14 recovery bays, six operating rooms with 21 recovery bays, 27 FHC exam spaces, and 20 FGP exam spaces. The endoscopy and operating suites will be Article 28 licensed sites. In November 2023, NYU Langone Brooklyn also received approval from the NYS DOH to begin an adult cardiac surgery program. This will allow patients to receive quality cardiac care in their own community. Construction for the first phase of this new inpatient service in the hospital is currently ongoing.A significant expansion of outpatient services is underway in Florida, including a new 180,000 square foot free standing multi specialty ambulatory hub in West Palm Beach, including four operating rooms, two endoscopy procedure rooms, a full complement of radiology modalities, physical therapy and multi specialty FGP physician offices. In February 2024, NYU Langone Health received a $75 million gift in support of this project, which NYU Langone Health anticipates will serve 150,000 patients annually across Florida. Site preparation and construction started in June and the new facility is expected to open to patients in 2026.Management anticipates that costs associated with any specific plans or projects will be funded from a combination of income generated from operations, philanthropy, and additional debt. Any borrowing in connection with such plans would be made in compliance with the requirements of the NYU Langone Hospitals Master Indenture.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT14Other Current EventsOn February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of Optum/United Health Group, was forced to shut down infor­mation technology systems and services due to a cyberattack. NYU Langone Health is among the many healthcare sys­tems that rely on Change Healthcare for its Assurance and Clearance platforms for critical operational needs, including claim submission, patient insurance verification, pharmacy verification, and receipt of payor remittances. That same day, NYU Langone Health disconnected its systems from Change Healthcare, and hospital billing was suspended for several days at the end of February.On February 22, 2024, NYU Langone Health selected alternate vendor platforms to perform both insurance eligibility verification and claim / remittance exchange. NYU Langone Health’s Information Technology (“IT”) department imme­diately integrated these platforms with Epic and by February 27, 2024, NYU Langone Health was submitting claims to select payors. By the first week of March, NYU Langone Health was submitting claims for all payers via the new plat­forms. The impact to patient care and financial operations has been significantly mitigated due to these measures. Throughout March, NYU Langone Health worked directly with Optum and related cybersecurity experts to ensure that the updated Change Healthcare platforms were secure. On March 29, 2024, NYU Langone Health reconnected its systems to Change Healthcare and began submitting claims as payors also began to reconnect to the system. NYU Langone Health returned to its normal claim submission operations in June 2024.CybersecurityCybersecurity is, and will continue to be, a strategic focus for NYU Langone Health across all campus locations. Its approach to the cyber technology landscape is to be dynamic and keeps pace with the latest technologies while imple­menting security layers to safeguard digital assets. NYU Langone Health leverages multiple levels of advanced technol­ogies to protect its digital assets. By implementing defense in depth cybersecurity measures, prioritizing human cen­tric security practices, and following industry best practices, NYU Langone Health has committed to establishing a comprehensive, resilient, and adaptive cybersecurity framework:•Cyber Threat Management and Incident Response: These programs anticipate and respond to emerging threats and incidents with informed precision, working to ensure that any suspicious activities are promptly addressed. •Vulnerability Management: This program proactively identifies critical vulnerabilities and works with the IT teams to remediate them before they become issues. •Security Architecture & Engineering and Penetration Testing: These programs evaluate the security of NYU Langone Health technologies and applications to strengthen and secure core digital assets.•Security Awareness and Education: This program includes phishing simulations, monthly security videos and posters, pop up security events, department presentations, newsletters, gamifications, and themed broadcasts to education and engage staff, building a formidable human firewall against cyber threats.NYU Langone Health continues to invest in advanced technologies such as ransom proof backups, remote access management, and network segmentation to further reinforce its security posture. NYU Langone Health currently maintains privacy liability and network security insurance through claims made policies. NYU Langone Health is self insured, with a primary insurance carrier who provides coverage above the self insurance portion. Excess limits above the self insurance portion and primary insurance coverage are shared among several commercial carriers. NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 15Early on, NYU Langone Health recognized the potential of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to improve the efficiency, quali­ty, and safety of health care delivery. Beginning in 2017, NYU Langone Health invested in recruiting high talent to unlock the potential of AI and created the Division of Ap­plied AI Technologies (“DAAIT”). Today, the DAAIT in NYU Langone Health’s IT department uses data and modeling to predict health outcomes across the enterprise, helping clinicians and staff make important clinical decisions in real time, while increasing operational efficiencies. NYU Langone Health now employs a combination of home­grown and vendor based models counting over 50 models in production, publishing thought leadership articles via social media and external communication platforms, sub­mitting AI findings to national and international medical journals, and developing the standards that will define how AI is used in healthcare. NYU Langone Health is also one of the first institutions to use a private HIPAA compli­ant ChatGPT instance.NYU Langone Health continues to invest in ongoing prior­ity AI initiatives to enhance efficiency, patient safety, and quality. NYU Langone Health also fosters AI innovation that extends beyond these three focus areas. For example, in the clinical realm, this includes studying generative AI for drafting responses to patients; ambient notetaking during patient visits; evaluating and standardizing pro­vider written documentation; and using generative AI to identify incremental findings in radiology exams and to write patient friendly discharge summaries. With these foundational works, NYU Langone Health’s goal is to implement these models in clinical practice with proper guardrails, and to measure the impact with experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials. Another example of using AI at NYU Langone Health is helping physicians capture patients with comorbid conditions relevant to the primary admission reason, and to ensure that the physicians’ orders were carried through, as well as projects that focus on overall patient engagement.NYUTron, a BERT style (Bidirectional Encoder Represen­tations from Transformers) large language model that was created at NYU Langone Health, was trained on 7.25 mil­lion patient care notes and 4.1 billion words, incorporat­ing data spanning nearly a decade. Built in roughly three weeks by NYU Langone Health, the 109 million parameter model is being put to the test with patients. NYU Langone Health’s contribution was evaluating its effectiveness for real clinical tasks, such as predicting inpatient hospi­tal mortality, computing the comorbidity index, 30 day all cause readmission, length of stay, and payer denial at discharge. NYU Langone Health is now building clinical trials around these models. For inpatient mortality use cases, NYUTron aims to improve patient care by providing early warnings and facilitating important conversations about patient care preferences and, when appropriate, end of life planning.To continue innovating and identifying new ideas, NYU Langone Health created a citizen data scientist program with a goal of empowering every person at the institu­tion to experiment with NYU Langone Health’s private ChatGPT. Over the last year, NYU Langone Health de­veloped events such as Generative AI prompt a thons, hack a thons, educational materials, and weekly office hours designed to support users in developing and iterating AI ideas. Today, there are over 2,000 users. NYU Langone Health has five GPT based models in production, with nearly 20 in active development, and multiple others in the backlog. NYU Langone Health’s institutional and hospital leadership fully support and champion these AI initiatives and believe these applications will be transfor­mative for NYU Langone Health now and in the future.NYU Langone Health implements all AI models under a common concern to deploy these models safely, eq­uitably, and ethically on NYU Langone Health’s secure HIPAA compliant IT platforms, and provide clear guidance to clinicians, researchers, and staff with policies to guide their use. NYU Langone Health is laying the groundwork for scalable success in AI by prioritizing infrastructure and assuring privacy and security across all its cloud provid­ers’ AI products. This work involved deep dives into the security and architecture of each system, understanding the risks and building appropriate compensatory con­trols, if applicable, including amending business associate agreements.Role of Artificial IntelligenceNYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT16Medical AdvancesFirst fully robotic lung transplantIn September 2024, NYU Langone Health announced that its surgeons had per­formed the first fully robotic lung transplant in the nation. The procedure marks a new milestone in surgical innovation and patient care, making NYU Langone Health only the third program in the world to use a robotic system in a lung trans­plant surgery. Surgeons performed a minimally invasive procedure to transplant a patient’s right lung by creating small incisions between the ribs on the right side of the chest and then using the robotic system to remove the lung, prepare the surgical site for implantation, and implant the new lung. The second lung was transplanted through an open incision on the patient’s left side. The NYU Lan­gone Transplant Institute performed 78 lung transplants in 2024 and was rated best in the nation for lung survival after transplant and getting patients off the waitlists fastest by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, a national quality tracker overseen by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. Long COVID in children and adolescentsA research team led by the National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER Initiative and supported by its Clinical Science Core at NYUGSOM has designed a new way to identify which school age children and adolescents are most likely to have long COVID. Published online in August 2024, in the Journal of the Amer­ican Medical Association, the study index used combinations of symptoms distinct for each age group—ten symptoms in school age children and eight in adolescents—to indicate the likely presence of long COVID. The research index is based on long term symptoms that were more common among children with a history of COVID 19 infection when compared to those who had no history of infection. Kidney transplantation risks dropThe risk of death for kidney donors has dropped by more than half, according to a study led by faculty members at the NYUGSOM. The study was published online in August 2024 and challenges current mortality rate statistics. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, roughly 6,000 Americans vol­unteer to donate a kidney each year. Before undergoing the procedure, donors are informed of the potential risks, including death. Based on data from 1995 through 2009, healthcare experts formerly predicted that about three of every 10,000 donors were likely to die within three months of the procedure. The authors of the new NYU Langone Health study argue that advances in surgical techniques, donor selection, and postoperative care have rendered that estimate outdated. Analyzing three decades of medical records representing 164,593 kidney donors from across the country, a team led by researchers at NYU Langone Health found that by 2022, fewer than one death occurred for every 10,000 donations. The new report is the first since 2009 to examine trends in mortality risk among living kidney donors. As a result, it better reflects the reality of organ donation when laparoscopic nephrectomy is standard practice.XenotransplantationIn April 2024, surgeons at NYU Langone Health performed the first combined mechanical heart pump and gene edit­ed pig kidney transplant surgery. The heart pump was surgically implanted days before embarking on the transplant, which included a gene edited kidney and a pig’s thymus gland to aid against re­jection. To date, there have been no documented instances of anyone with a me­chanical heart pump receiving an organ transplant of any kind. It is only the sec­ond transplant of a gene edited pig kidney into a living person and the first with the thymus combined. Unfortunate­ly, the kidney presented unique challenges working with the patient’s heart pump and it was electively removed for­ty seven days post transplant. By undergoing this procedure, this patient allowed NYU Langone Health to make an in­credible leap forward in xenotransplantation. This contribution to medicine cannot be overstated. NYU Langone Health still be­lieves this important innovation sets the stage for sanctioned studies as early as next year. Nearly 104,000 people are on the waiting list for a transplant, with approximately 89,000 of those waiting for a kidney. Nearly 808,000 people in the United States have end stage kidney disease, but only about 27,000 were able to receive a transplant last year.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 17SustainabilityAt NYU Langone Health, caring for patients and communities extends to its care for the environment. Climate change is a global health issue which affects the livelihood of patients, communities, and staff. Flooding, wildfires, heat waves, and other climate related hazards are becoming more intense, longer, and more frequent due to climate change. These hazards all carry significant health and economic impacts.NYU Langone Health’s work to significantly reduce its greenhouse gases will not only reduce the demand of natural resources through efficient operations and cleaner energy, but also build and support healthy and equitable communi­ties. As NYU Langone Health leads initiatives to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions from its facilities, it is equally as important for NYU Langone Health to leverage its voice and size to advocate for decarbonization throughout the healthcare value chain.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT18Energy Management & Greenhouse Gas Emission ReductionNYU Langone Health’s goals are continuously evolving to support New York City, New York State, and national climate all in service of the U.S. commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. Reducing NYU Langone Health’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions offers a multitude of benefits such as improving the quality of air in the communities served, in­creasing resiliency and energy efficiency, supporting the local economy, and making the institution’s buildings healthier and more comfortable for patients and staff.NYU Langone Health is committed to becoming a carbon neutral health system by 2050 as signatories to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Health Sector Pledge. This goal affects every facet of NYU Langone Health, in­cluding design, construction, and operations. As an interim goal, NYU Langone Health has committed to a reduc­tion in Scope 1 & 2 emissions intensity (MT CO2e/square feet) by 2030 from a 2021 baseline. By the end of 2023, NYU Langone Health reduced emissions intensity by . As outlined by the pledge, the institution is also currently working on a comprehensive Scope 3 emissions analysis. The results of both inventories will inform long term decarbonization strategies and goals. NYU Langone Health has also been a longstanding participant in the NYC Carbon Challenge for its owned and leased facilities in New York City, totaling roughly 6 million square feet of real estate. It achieved its first carbon reduction goal of in 2015, four years ahead of schedule. Building upon that success, the institution increased to a carbon reduction goal by 2025. As of 2023, NYU Langone Health has reduced its carbon emissions by under the Carbon Challenge framework.The organization’s sustainability program is built on a foundation of strong energy management practices and resilient energy infrastructure investments. The organization invests heavily in system wide programs and scalable capital im­provement projects such as LED retrofits, computer power management, state of the art equipment like ultra efficient chiller plants and on site cogeneration, and deep retrofits of energy systems to increase resiliency and reliability. These high impact projects are paired with continuous monitoring and building automation to make sure that systems are functioning optimally.In fiscal year 2023, NYU Langone Health achieved $11.7 million in energy savings (not including cogeneration plant savings) with a single year return on investment of . Fiscal year 2024 energy savings is still being evaluated. Since 2008, the program has achieved over $76 million in net program savings with a return on investment. In addition, through Q4 2024, the institution earned a record $2.8 million in annual revenue for the demand response program, which sheds electrical load during times of high grid stress and helps prevent local brownouts and blackouts. This pro­gram alone has led to $13 million in revenue since its inception in 2014. The Energy & Sustainability team was also able to secure nearly $0.8 million in grants and incentives in fiscal year 2023 to help fund its energy conservation projects.Other Key Initiatives and Achievements•In addition to pursuing high impact opportunities, the NYU Langone Health engineering and commissioning team standardizes efficient engineering designs across all renovation and new construction projects and ensures NYU Langone Health is delivering on its sustainability goals. These standards include a U.S. Green Building Council LEED Gold minimum certification, with five certified projects totaling 1.6 million square feet of space. In 2024, NYU Lan­gone Health’s ambulatory care center in Garden City, which is the institution’s largest ambulatory site to date on Long Island with 260,000 square feet, achieved LEED Silver certification. •NYU Langone Health has a thriving urban honeybee program to support the local ecosystem and pollination. It hosts three hives located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island. The hives produce 220 pounds of hyperlocal honey that is harvested and is sold in gift shops and farmers markets.•For Earth Month in April 2024, the Sustainability team partnered with Partnerships for Parks to host NYU Langone Health’s first tree planting event where over 30 employees and their families volunteered at a NYC public park in Manhattan.•In 2024, NYUGSOM published its first Planetary Health Report Card, a metric based tool to track, share, and identi­fy institutional opportunities for climate integration in curriculum, research, advocacy, and infrastructure.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 19Community Benefits•In 2024, NYU Langone Health was named the U.S. and North American winner of the Schneider Sustainability Im­pact Awards and received 7 environmental excellence awards from Practice Green health and Health Care Without Harm, including Top 10 in Green Buildings. Over the past 10 years, NYU Langone Health has earned more than 85 energy and environmental excellence awards for its leading sustainability efforts.•NYU Langone Health is an active member of the U.S. Health Care Climate Council, a network organization member of the National Academy of Medicine’s Action Collaborative on Decarbonizing the U.S. Health Sector, and a partici­pant in the International Health Care Climate Challenge and Healthier Hospitals Safer Chemicals Challenge, among other partnerships and commitments.•In late 2023, NYU Langone Health donated over 400 clinical and lab coats to Material for the Arts, a creative reuse center run by the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs. This material is made available, free of charge, to NYC public schools, city agencies, and nonprofits with arts programming within NYC.•NYU Langone Health partners with Summit Ridge Energy and serves as the sole off taker of the utility credits gen­erated by two 4 megawatts battery storage projects on Staten Island. Those projects, which were energized, com­missioned and began generating power in fall 2023, help reduce both carbon emissions and grid demand during peak hours. This partnership has a way of demonstrating the role that large end users, such as hospitals, can play in the decarbonization of New York’s energy grid and increasing the resiliency of the community.NYU Langone Health is rooted in its tripartite mission to care, teach, and discover. Fulfillment of these missions is not limited to the physical bounds of the NYU Langone Health campuses but extends into the surrounding neighborhoods to care for the communities in which NYU Langone Health operates. To that end, in fiscal year 2023, NYU Langone Health contributed approximately $2.7 billion in Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) defined community benefits to fund charity and underfunded care, physician training, research support, and other community health investments. The impact of NYU Langone Health’s fiscal year 2024 investment in the community is still being evaluated. $2 billionCharity & Underfunded CareCharity: $88 millionGovernmental payors: $1.8 billionOther unsubsidized care: $64 million$662 millionPhysician Training and ResearchEducation and Training: $298 millionMedical Research Funding: $364 million$87 millionCommunity Health ContributionsCommunity Health Improvements: $36 millionCash in Kind: $50 millionEnvironmental Improvements & Other Community Support : $1 millionNYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT20In addition to assisting patients by providing financial support, NYU Langone Health aims to promote equity in health outcomes and build an inclusive culture of medi­cine by aiding vulnerable populations. In April 2024, NYU Langone Radiology Fort Hamilton opened in Southwest Brooklyn providing a location for breast imaging, breast biopsies, and bone density testing. This location provides a patient centered space for critical preventative and diagnostic services as part of NYU Lan­gone Health’s commitment to the Brooklyn community. The physicians and staff at NYU Langone Radiology Fort Hamilton work collaboratively with the Perlmutter Cancer Center locations in Brooklyn to ensure patients receive timely care and treatment for breast cancer and other diagnoses.NYU Langone Brooklyn continues to expand programs that are responsive to the needs of the Brooklyn commu­nity. In November 2023, NYU Langone Brooklyn received approval from NYS DOH to begin an adult cardiac surgery program. After significant operational planning, this pro­gram will go live in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 in full collaboration with the cardiac surgery programs in Manhattan and Long Island under the umbrella of NYU Langone Health. The goal of this program is to provide the highest quality cardiac surgery services close to where patients live, therefore reducing the travel burden on patients. In addition, with the implementation of cardiac surgery, NYU Langone Brooklyn will expand electrophysi­ology services to meet the needs of patients with cardiac rhythm disorders.In Sunset Park, Brooklyn and other neighborhoods served by NYU Langone Brooklyn, care for the elderly is a grow­ing concern as the population ages. Seniors make up approximately of the patients admitted to NYU Lan­gone Brooklyn’s emergency department and falls account for about of such patients’ injuries. NYU Langone Hospitals’ geriatrics department, which ranked No. 2 in the 2024 25 U.S. News & World Report “Best Geriatrics Hospitals” survey, is exploring ways to reduce the trau­matic impact of falls. By designing a clinical protocol for seniors with fall related injuries who come to the emer­gency department (the “Geriatric Trauma Program”), NYU Langone Brooklyn’s Level I Trauma Center is working to improve the level of care that seniors receive. The scope of services provided to the Brooklyn com­munity has significantly expanded since NYU Langone Hospitals’ 2016 merger with Lutheran Medical Center. Such services include electrophysiologic diagnostic and interventional treatment for dysrhythmias, gynecologic surgical oncology, advanced endovascular neurosurgical care, advanced percutaneous interventions for coronary artery disease, specialized care for neurologic critical care, and endocrine specialty care. Robotic surgery was introduced at the time of the merger, and volume has in­creased every year since, with surgeons performing 1,181 robotic procedures at NYU Langone Brooklyn in fiscal year 2024. These advanced surgical techniques provide for significantly shorter recovery times compared to conventional approaches. NYU Langone Brooklyn not only provides clinical care to the community, but also strives to improve the health of the community through addressing social determinants of health and closing health equity gaps. Examples include expanding its internal medicine residency training program to incorporate a curriculum that addresses the social determinants of health, cre­ating a community based psychiatry residency training program to focus on training future psychiatrists to care for underserved and immigrant communities, and signifi­cantly expanding efforts to engage patients from diverse backgrounds in research that focuses on improving health outcomes. Twenty two new research studies have opened in the past year with over half of participants speaking a primary language other than English.In March 2023, the Latino Liver Program was launched, which aims to help reduce health disparities within the region’s large and growing Latino population by offering linguistically and culturally conscious liver care while actively seeking referrals from other providers. Among people of Hispanic and Latino ethnicity in the United States, the rate of chronic liver disease is roughly two fold higher than it is for the non Hispanic, White population. Similar disparities exist for rates of liver cancer diagno­ses and deaths. Even so, Hispanic and Latino people are referred to liver transplant centers, evaluated, and added to liver transplant waitlists at significantly lower rates than their non Hispanic White counterparts. Modeled on pre existing Asian liver health programs at NYU Langone Health and elsewhere, the Latino Liver Program has grown to include about a dozen providers who work collabora­tively to care for patients with liver cancer or other acute or chronic diseases or help them navigate the long and complicated transplantation process. One major goal is to address why Latino people, who make up the second largest demographic in New York City, are not represented in similar numbers in liver evaluations and transplant lists. Beyond a lack of access to primary and specialty care, in many cases, patients may be referred to medical centers where language and cultural barriers interfere with their continuum of care. To help overcome those hurdles, the program is allocating significant resources beyond Man­hattan and reaching out to gastroenterologists and other providers in the region to create more awareness and increase referrals.NYU Langone Hospitals continues to work to innovate care delivery strategies that meet patient needs by devel­oping programs that include partnering with community health workers and faith based groups to treat high blood pressure in South Asian and Black communities, bring­ing behavioral healthcare to underserved populations in Brooklyn, and reopening the free, medical student run community health clinic on Long Island. Additionally, theCommunity Investments in Brooklyn and QueensNYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 21The FHC’s Community Medicine Program provides healthcare to adults at 10 residential shelters throughout New York City for people experiencing housing issues, transitional living, or homelessness. Care teams include a registered nurse, physician or nurse practitioner, psychiatric specialist, social worker, and care manager. The Nurse in Shelter program was created with the Department of Homeless Services to advance healthcare accessibility for the city’s homeless pop­ulation by conducting screenings in shelters without clinics and connecting patients to healthcare services. In April 2023, NYU Langone Health opened the Joseph S. and Diane H. Steinberg Ambulatory Care Center, which builds upon the existing standalone emergency department by adding access to multiple specialties, including cancer care, pediatric care, outpatient surgeries, and other physician practices in Brooklyn’s Cobble Hill neighborhood. Since opening, the number of patients treated each day in the emergency department continues to rise, with the total volume exceeding 48,000 visits in the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. In addition, the number of ambulance arrivals has increased, with over 9,500 arrivals in the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. As a consequence of the rise in the emergency department volume, patients observed and admitted to NYU Langone Brooklyn or NYU Langone Hospitals’ Manhattan campus totaled more than 4,400 admissions for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. With the ability to receive critically ill patients, the critical care transfers from NYU Langone staffed and local 911 ambulances account for of emergency department arrivals. This has allowed for more immediate care for the sickest patients, including those from Red Hook, Brooklyn. The Steinberg Ambulatory Care Center has two, fully operationalized operating rooms with a total case volume of 7,575 procedures for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. These procedures have been successfully performed by 56 different surgeons across 15 specialties, including robotic surgery. Community Investments in Suffolk CountySince the affiliation with LICH in March 2022, NYU Lan­gone Health has dedicated substantial time and resources towards improving operations at LICH. In order to build a reliable network of high quality providers and broaden the range of services available to the surrounding community, NYU Langone Health has transitioned LICH physicians into the FGP, recruited over 125 FGP doctors of varying specialties, and opened multiple ambulatory practices, in­cluding a new infusion center that sees over 1,100 elective visits each week. NYU Langone Health has also brought its best operational practices to LICH, designed to improve survival rates, reduce complications, and reduce length of stay. NYU Langone Health has dedicated these resources and practices with the objective of aligning the quality of care provided at LICH with the patient centered, quality care provided at all NYU Langone Health locations. NYU Langone Health has also integrated LICH patient data into Epic, and transitioned LICH’s general ledger, supply chain management, and human capital management systems into NYU Langone Health’s PeopleSoft environment. LICH’s CON application to construct an ambulatory sur­gery center in Patchogue was approved by the NYS DOHFHC’s School Based Dental Health Program offers children access to dental care in 59 public schools citywide. Annu­ally, the program provides free comprehensive dentistry and oral health education for approximately 25,000 students. The program, which recently expanded into Queens with four new sites in the Rockaways and Corona Park, meets the needs of children seen through the FHC’s school based clinics.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT22and construction is underway. The new ambulatory sur­gery center will include six operating rooms and four pro­cedure rooms to meet current and future surgical volume. In fiscal year 2023, South Shore Neurologic Associates joined NYU Langone Health’s ambulatory care network, bringing an additional 20,000 patients and 200 employ­ees into NYU Langone Health. Locations in Patchogue, Riverhead, and Islip offer a wide range of neurologic care, including diagnostic testing, physical therapy, and pain management, to meet the needs of a diverse patient pop­ulation in Suffolk County.In February 2024, Long Island Anesthesia Physicians joined the NYU Langone Health network. Currently the exclusive anesthesia provider at LICH, this partnership meets the increased need for anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists who can support NYU Langone Health’s growing patient volume, procedures, and surgeries. With the addition of Long Island Anesthesia Physicians, NYU Langone Health now relies on a team of over 40 anesthesiologists, 100 certified registered nurse anesthe­tists, and two nurse practitioners to meet the growing de­mands of patient care while striving to improve efficiency, quality, and consistency. This partnership aligns with NYU Langone Health’s strategic goals of expanding services, including the development of an ambulatory surgery center in Patchogue and other future growth initiatives in both Suffolk and Nassau counties.In February 2024, LICH hosted a full scale Mass Casu­alty Incident (“MCI”) exercise in partnership with South Country Ambulance Company and other Suffolk County businesses and municipal agencies. The MCI drill provided a learning opportunity to validate LICH’s disaster plan and provided a no fault environment to increase LICH’s read­iness to respond to and manage multiple victims from an incident involving gunshot wound trauma. Exercise ac­tivities included testing real time notifications, activating the MCI response protocols, mobilizing departments to support the emergency department, triage, patient place­ment, patient registration and tracking via Epic Disaster Mode, decanting, and surgery prioritization.LICH also works with local emergency medical service providers on the Suffolk County MCI Plan, and provides Narcan training, diabetes education programs, advanced Trauma Life Support Certification, and injury and fall pre­vention courses to municipal partners.The statistics on the NYS DOH Opioid Dashboard report that for 2023, there were 21 opioid related overdose deaths per 100,000 residents in Suffolk County com­pared to 13 opioid related overdose deaths per 100,000 residents on average in New York State. There was also a surge in mental health issues and suicides, particularly among the youth population. LICH offers biweekly men­tal health education for family and friends of individuals struggling with mental illness as well as substance use disorders. LICH has six primary care centers recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance as a pa­tient centered medical home, which is a patient centered approach to care, with the ability to provide assessments to patients experiencing behavioral health or substance abuse issues. LICH also provides medical assisted treat­ment services for substance abuse for those willing to accept treatment. Moreover, LICH’s patient chemical de­pendency program is licensed under the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services. The program provides assessment, treatment, education, and linkage to other community services for patients 18 years and older. NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 23Charity and Underfunded CareNYU Langone Health is committed to ensuring that its care is not limited to those who have insurance coverage or the means to pay for care. NYU Langone Health recognizes that there are times when patients in need of care will have difficulty paying for the services provided. Accordingly, NYU Langone Health has implemented a discount policy and financial aid program that is consistent with the mission, values, and capacity of NYU Langone Health, while considering an individual’s ability to contribute to their care. In fiscal year 2024, more than two thirds of inpatients were enrolled in a government spon­sored insurance plan: Medicare, Medicaid, and self pay. NYU Langone Health’s charity care policy, in accordance with the NYS DOH’s guidelines, ensures the provision of health care services to the community served while considering the ability of the patient to pay. The policy has sliding fee schedules for inpatient, ambulatory, and emergency services provided to the uninsured and under insured patients that qualify. NYU Langone Health provides discounts for eligible patients up to of the Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”) and lower discounts for eligible patients up to of the FPL. Total charges associated with providing care to charity patients for the year ended August 31, 2024 was $488.6 million. NYU Langone Health determines the cost of providing these services based on a ratio of cost to charges.Further, New York State regulations provide for the distribution of funds from an indigent care pool, which is intended to partially offset the cost of uncompensated care and services provided to uninsured patients. NYU Langone Health paid $84.8 million and $77.7 million into the indigent care pool for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively, but only received $61.3 million and $56.9 million in pool distributions for those periods, leaving an unreimbursed contribution to the pools of $23.5 million and $20.8 million. In addition, and of NYU Langone Health’s discharged patients during the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 and Au­gust 31, 2023, respectively, were uninsured or insured through government payors. NYU Langone Health incurs material costs in treating those patients and does so at a loss given the shortfall in both Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.

Through August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, NYU Langone Hospitals provided $231.6 million and $178.4 million, respectively, of funding to support research and education operations at the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine. The goal of this investment is to make new discoveries and generate knowledge to further health outcomes. In May 2021, NYUGSOM was awarded a NIH grant to study the long term effects of the COVID 19 infection. Se­lected as the Clinical Science Core (“CSC”) for NIH’s $1.15 billion Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (“RECOV­ER”) initiative, NYU Langone Health leads and integrates the research activities of 35 research hubs and more than 100 sub sites around the country. Since the launch of the study, NYUGSOM has been awarded $489.8 million, which is subcontracted from NYUGSOM to the research hubs and their sub sites, and $51.6 million in grant funding for CSC activities. In September 2024, NYUGSOM was awarded an additional $109.5 million to support initia­tives at the adult and pediatric sites through the award’s current end date of May 2025. Both the revenue and ex­pense of the CSC, including for activities subcontracted to research hubs, pass through the Statement of Operations of NYU Langone Health, but are for substantially offsetting amounts and do not have a material effect on operating margin.NYU Langone Health believes the best way to prepare physicians for any career in medicine is to provide care for culturally and socioeconomically diverse patient populations in a variety of clinical settings. NYU Langone Hospitals operates a graduate medical education pro­gram in more than 150 medical residency and fellowship training programs, employing more than 1,300 residents and fellows. The programs offer hands on clinical training to medical degree graduates under the supervision of the faculty of the NYU Grossman Schools of Medicine where residents encounter and treat a broad range of patients and diseases. As previously noted, both NYU Grossman Schools of Med­icine offer full tuition scholarships to all students enrolled in the MD degree program. These scholarships address the rising costs of medical education, help to attract the best and brightest students to careers in medicine, and make attending medical school available to a broader range of applicants. These scholarships supported over $26.9 million and $26.1 million, respectively, of financial aid in fiscal year 2024 and 2023. While these scholarships were funded in part by NYU Grossman Schools of Medi­cine endowments, NYU Langone Hospitals also provided $26.5 million and $25.5 million in support to fund teach­ing activities through fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respec­tively.NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT26Obligated Group Financial HighlightsDays Cash on Hand CalculationThe table below sets forth the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group’s and the LICH Credit Group’s days’ cash on hand calculated pursuant to their respective Master Indenture definitions:Days cash on hand for the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group decreased to 144 days as of August 31, 2024, com­pared to 164 days as of August 31, 2023. The decrease in days cash on hand was primarily driven by capital expendi­tures to support strategic capital investments and support NYUGSOM for building and other capital acquisitions, offset by cash received from the 340B settlement and cash generated from operations. Days cash on hand for the LICH Credit Group increased to 72 days as of August 31, 2024, compared to 56 days as of August 31, 2023. The increase in cash and investments is a result of $48.5 million in cash generated from operations, $9.4 million generated from asset sales and divestitures of minority interest investments and $5.9 million of invest­ment gains, partially offset by expenditures of $32.1 million to support LICH’s capital investment and the repayment of $6.9 million in intercompany payables. Debt Service Coverage RatioThe decrease in the debt service ratio from the prior comparative period is primarily due to a reduction in one time items included in income available for debt service. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2023, the excess of rev­enue over expenses includes the settlement payment of $508.0 million from Turner Construction Company for unre­covered losses suffered from Superstorm Sandy. There are no similarly material one time items recorded in the twelve months ended August 31, 2024. The table below sets forth the NYU Langone Hospitals Obligated Group’s debt service coverage ratio.

FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT 39Notes to the Financial StatementsFINANCIAL INFORMATIONThe financial information furnished herein is unaudited and thus is subject to change; however, in the opin­ion of management, the information reflects all adjustments that are necessary to fairly state the financial position, and the results of its operations and changes in its net assets without donor restrictions for the interim periods indicated of NYU Langone Health including the presentation of standalone financial infor­mation for NYU Langone Hospitals and the LICH Credit Group.NYU Langone Health presumes that users of this interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements of NYU Langone Hospitals and NYU Langone Health which contain the LICH Credit Group financial statements, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The Financial Statements of NYU Langone Hospitals and NYU Langone Health which contain the LICH Credit Group financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 are on file at www.emma.msrb.org. Patient volumes and net operating revenues are subject to seasonal variations caused by several factors, including, but not necessarily limited to, seasonal cycles of illness, climate and weather conditions, vaca­tion patterns of both hospital patients and admitting physicians and other factors relating to the timing of elective hospital procedures. Interim operating results are not necessarily representative of operations for a full year for various reasons, including levels of occupancy and other patient volumes, interest rates, unusual or non recurring items and other seasonal fluctuations. These same considerations apply to all year to year comparisons.BASIS OF PRESENTATIONThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the August 31, 2023 audited financial statements of NYU Langone Health. They do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) con­sidered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.INVESTMENTS AND ASSETS LIMITED AS TO USE Short term investments consist of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Long term investments include donor restricted and unrestricted endowment funds held in a pooled in­vestment portfolio maintained by NYU.Assets limited as to use primarily consist of externally restricted assets held under long term debt agree­ments, assets restricted for deferred retirement benefits, and assets restricted to pay professional liability claims. These assets consist primarily of marketable securities.USE OF ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, including estimated uncollectible accounts receivable for services to patients and the valuation of investments, and liabilities including estimated settlements with third party payors and malpractice insurance liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial state­ments. Estimates also affect the amounts of revenue and expenses reported during the period. There is at least a reasonable possibility that certain estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. Actual results could differ from those estimates.NOTE 1:NOTE 2:NOTE 3:NOTE 4:NYU LANGONE HEALTH FY2024 Q4 ANNUAL REPORT40AUTHORITATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS ADOPTEDIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The previous standard delays the recognition of a credit loss on a finan­cial asset until the loss is probable of occurring. The new standard removes the requirement that a credit loss be probable of occurring for it to be recognized, and requires entities to use historical experience, cur­rent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate their future expected credit losses. The standard is required to be applied using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to net assets, if any, upon adoption. This ASU is effective for NYU Langone Health for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. NYU Langone Health adopted the ASU for fiscal year 2024 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the combined financial statements.RETIREMENT PLANSNYU Langone Health provides pension and similar benefits to its employees through several plans, includ­ing various multiemployer plans for union employees, a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan primarily for eligible nonunion employees of NYU Langone Health and certain of its related organizations, and a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for certain executives. NYU Langone Health also pro­vides pension and similar benefits to certain employees through a defined contribution plan. NYU Lan­gone Health funds the noncontributory defined benefit plans in accordance with the minimum funding requirement of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), plus additional amounts that NYU Langone Health may deem appropriate from time to time. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 required certain changes to the minimum funding requirements, among other provisions, commencing in 2008. Amounts contributed to the defined benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Contributions to union plans are based on union employee gross salary levels or rates required under union contractual arrangements. Contributions to NYU Langone Health’s defined contribution plan are generally determined on base salaries up to the IRS limit.Pension expense included in the statements of operations and changes in net assets for the twelve months ended August 31, 2024 totaled $363.2 million.NOTE 5NOTE 6:Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
