use of the rich data already available across the health system. “We are a science-driven medical center. Gaining insight from data is a theme that has transformed our clinical mission and our research mission. Now we’re working to make sure it’s transforming our education mission,” says Dr. Triola, emphasizing that data does not replace human decision making but rather positions decision making to be more successful because it is more informed. New Insights Pinpoint New Opportunities Using data from a wide set of sources—including the learning management system, evaluation and assessment tools, simulation checklists, student information system, and electronic medical record, EPIC—IIME built an education data warehouse that enables educators to visualize and act nimbly on education-related data. “We’re leveraging all this data that we collect about our learners, about the curriculum, and about the healthcare system to inform our educational programs,” says Dr. Triola. “It makes perfect sense, but it’s not an approach that’s used by most medical schools.” The IIME recently received an award from the Association of American Medical Colleges’ Group on Information Resources for making “significant contributions to academic medicine information technology.” The data warehouse, combined with enterprise analytics, gives educators a deeper understanding—in real time—of what students are learning, how they are performing, what they will need in future practice, and what changes can be made today to better prepare them for that future. The same can be said for faculty members, who gain actionable insights, again in real time, into their performance and the effectiveness of their teaching and evaluating. “With the infrastructure and ability to collect, analyze, and summarize all of this data, it gives us the ability to create a continuous quality improvement approach to medical education,” says Dr. Triola. “It’s moved us away from education driven by anecdotes to education driven by an epidemiologic approach.” NYU Grossman School of Medicine will use such a data-driven approach—combined, importantly, with human input—to inform and improve the transition from undergraduate to graduate medical education (UME/GME). The school collects a vast array of data on its undergraduate medical students—on their strengths and weaknesses, educational goals and trajectory, assessments and competencies—but little of that information makes it across the UME/GME divide. Now, with a $1.8 million grant from the American Medical Association’s (AMA’s) Reimagining Residency initiative, five residency programs will have access to that data right after a student matches to that program. Each student will connect with a residency coach, and, together with the resident’s mentor from NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s undergraduate coaching/advising Violet Society Program, they will use the data at hand to create a road map ensuring curricular continuity and relevance, and, ultimately, enhancing readiness for practice. NYU Langone is uniquely positioned to develop and benefit from the five-year project, Transition to Residency Advantage, Dr. Triola notes, because a higher-than-average percentage of the graduates continue on through residency: 40 percent, compared with a national average of 24 percent. Active Learning through Technology Back in the classroom, the next student who wears the VR goggles becomes immersed in her selected organ, the pancreas. She first rotates a healthy 3D pancreas 360 degrees, then elects to view the pancreas with diabetes—to see the devastating effects of the chronic illness on the organ. The class is part of an emergency medicine clerkship designed to give students firsthand experience with the specialty. Elsewhere in the conference room, fellow second-year students in VR goggles are immersed in a simulation to save a baby having a seizure. The immersive nature of the VR technology enables each student to check the baby’s vitals, clear the airway, give oxygen, and select lifesaving IV medications. The simulation increases in difficulty by medically complicating the situation and by introducing the baby’s virtual mother and a series of cascading distractions. “The simulation allows students to put their knowledge and skills into practice and make ‘real-life’ decisions without compromising a real patient’s safety,” says Carol DerSarkissian, MD, Res. ’02, clinical assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine. She developed the VR segment of the class with Gregory Dorsainville, MPS, IIME’s senior multimedia developer, after she took the Virtual Reality in Medical Education certification course he teaches for faculty. “This is active, experiential learning, as opposed to passive learning, and students will remember more because they are learning from experience,” says Dr. DerSarkissian. “That gives them a more solid memory and a deeper understanding of that clinical situation and of that disease state.” Novel technologies are driving profound advances in surgeries, research, and imaging. NYU Grossman School of Medicine is infusing technology into the curriculum both to ensure that students have a fluency with the tools of their future and to capitalize on what these technologies enable students to learn and do. This kind of enriched learning brings medical students deep inside a human body to experience systems, organs, and structures, as well as various states of disease and wellness, up close and remarkably intact. “The overall concept is that it’s difficult to visualize in one’s mind what these structures actually look like, where they’re positioned, and what they’re doing. Immersive 3D tech does that,” notes Dorsainville, who is the developer behind many of the learning experiences that integrate existing and emerging technologies at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. He narrates the immersive learning that is possible in a VR session: “Look at the heart. You can see different layers, the circulation, and the process of beating. You can see the nerves firing across all the muscles, which you can’t do with a cadaver. You can play with the values to manipulate how fast the heart is beating. There, that’s what it looks and sounds like at 75 beats per minute. Now speed it up, or slow it down.” Starting this fall, students will be using virtual and augmented reality, 3D cinematic renderings of CT and MRI scans, and a new collection of plastinations, which are human cadavers preserved with plastic resins. In its leadership role as an innovator in medical education, the school continues to seek out the optimal way to combine technology and patient-based learning to best prepare the next generation of physicians and scientists. “Conventional 2D clinical imaging—such as CT, MRI, and radiography—will be infused into the anatomy curriculum, so the students learn living human anatomy in the way they will be seeing it in the future,” explains Kira Melamud ’10, assistant professor of radiology. “Strategic use of advanced 3D rendering techniques will further enhance the students’ understanding of critical spatial relationships.” New technologies that are being developed and used across the school and health system—including the point-of-care ultrasound—are only as good as the problems they solve and the benefits they deliver to people. “Technology is the enabler, not the driver, of the human changes that we want to realize in our education and clinical systems,” says Dr. Triola. “We’re not casting around for something to do with iPhones because we have them. Rather, because we know we have to have certain conversations at the bedside, we might investigate how an iPhone could help.” Ruth M. Crowe ’86, PhD (GSAS ’86), associate professor of medicine and director of integrated clinical skills, has collaborated with IIME to develop apps that provide standardized, real-time feedback for OSCEs (Objective Structured Clinical Examinations) as well as for workplace-based assessments, such as oral presentations and patient handovers. “Technologic innovations such as the I-PASS app enable standardized assessments that can be measured and followed longitudinally,” says Dr. Crowe. “We’re gamifying around it: we can motivate learners to collect authentic clinical performance assessments in their electronic portfolio data with the realization that it can enhance their grades. This benefit drives behavior change in the form of practice and feedback, and leads to better patient outcomes.” She emphasizes the importance of collaboration with clinical teaching faculty, ensuring that the assessment tasks and technology support their teaching goals, enhance communication with learners, and do not require undue time or attention from learners or instructors. “The major lift is not in creating the tool itself,” she says. The hard part lies in getting buy-in for using the tool. IIME developed NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s Educator Community to inspire and support faculty development in education innovations, including how to use data, novel technology, and e-learning modules to meet teaching and learning demands. In addition to holding regular workshops and providing resources to help faculty members remain current on the latest tools and techniques, the Educator Community holds an annual Medical Education Innovations and Scholarship Day to honor faculty who embrace technology and take it to the next level. Dr. Crowe’s goal is to support instructors and learners through change. “As we move toward competency-based medical education, these innovations can help sustain a major culture shift,” she says.

Thanks go out to the entire FACES community and all they do to move our mission forward. Celebrating Milestone Giving to Transform Health A Night Honoring Exceptional Generosity and Impact—in Brooklyn and Beyond Leaders and friends of NYU Langone Health reunited on Wednesday, November 1, for the 2023 Violet Ball, celebrating a remarkable $2 billion raised since the previous Violet Ball in November 2019—and nearly $200 million through the event itself. Nearly half of these funds were unrestricted, allowing the health system the flexibility to allocate resources where they are needed most—and reflecting the profound trust our supporters have in our institution and its ability to put philanthropic dollars to the best possible use. The event honored Jackie and Mike Bezos and the entire Bezos family, longtime visionary partners to NYU Langone. The Bezos family has provided consummate and strategic support over several decades for key initiatives to remove barriers to health and wellbeing and transform care for children, families, and entire communities. “What first brought Jackie and Mike to our doors was a powerful alignment with our central promise: to deliver one standard of outstanding care for everyone,” said Dean and CEO Robert I. Grossman, MD. “At the height of Covid and a very low point for our city and especially its poorest neighborhoods, they linked arms with us to effect lasting change.” With their most recent gift of $166 million in 2021, the Bezos family launched the Beyond Bridges initiative: a model for community-wide health improvement beginning in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, designed to scale to health systems across the nation. Through a network of clinical and community-based efforts built on the strengths of NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, and some of Brooklyn’s most successful and engaged community-based organizations, Beyond Bridges seeks to bridge health disparities and address social determinants of health by more deeply embedding the health system in the communities that it serves. “Jackie and Mike care only about their impact,” said Ken Langone. “I have never met two people who want less of the spotlight on them. They are far too focused on shining light on others.” A video highlighted the unparalleled impact and promise of the Beyond Bridges initiative. The Bezos family’s story is an illuminating case study in the power of philanthropy to unite people, programs, and infrastructure to catalyze progress and transform health. Since NYU Langone merged with Lutheran Medical Center in 2016 to create NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, the hospital has ascended to become one of the best and safest in the country, with an even lower mortality rate than NYU Langone’s flagship Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. Jackie and Mike took these efforts a step further, recognizing even greater potential in Brooklyn and an opportunity to realize true system- and community-wide change. “We set out to establish a new healthcare model that we hope will be replicated in communities across the country,” said Mike Bezos. “There is an enormous amount of work to be done, and NYU Langone Health is all in and paving the way.” NYU Langone supporters’ sweeping generosity in the past four years enabled NYU Langone not only to emerge resilient in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to climb higher, driving significant progress across its mission in patient care, research, and medical education. Today, the health system leads nationwide in quality and safety, including recognition as the top comprehensive academic medical center and ambulatory system for quality and safety by Vizient, Inc., with the highest grades across the board from The Leapfrog Group; both Vizient and Leapfrog are independent organizations who evaluate us using a wide range of performance metrics from across our enterprise. NYU Langone also continues to be recognized for its specialty care, with 10 specialties ranked in the top 10 nationally by A second video looked toward the future of NYU Langone Health. The Violet Ball was hosted once again at the iconic Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Paying It Forward After surviving breast cancer, philanthropist and former United States ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago, Beatrice W. Welters wanted to “pay it forward” by educating women about the importance of early detection and treatment. Consequently, the Beatrice W. Welters Breast Health Outreach and Navigation Program at Perlmutter Cancer Center was created in 2016. A Critically Important Focus Our target populations include African-American/Black women, who are twice as likely to have aggressive types of breast cancer that are harder to treat, and Hispanic and Latinx women, for whom breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death. The Welters Program educates women about breast cancer and the paramount importance of screening. Early screening can help identify cancer when it can be most effectively treated. The program also assists women in navigating the healthcare system through one-on-one guidance and direct interaction. Patient navigators, who are the key differentiators of program, go into communities to meet the women we seek to serve, where they live. The navigators play a pivotal role in supporting women—through one-to-one interaction—to negotiate the sometimes complex health care system. This unique approach supports women from screening through diagnosis to treatment, into, and through survivorship. Patient navigators identify women who could benefit from breast cancer screening through outreach and educational programs in community venues that women routinely visit, such as beauty salons, churches, and mosques. Growth of the program includes expanding this program into new communities by adding additional navigators, getting more women into clinical trials, providing genetic counseling, and continuing to share our Welters Program experiences with other healthcare systems and providers seeking to address the issues of inequity of access and service for women of color. Support the Welters Program Celebrating the Sala Institute On November 12, our community came together to celebrate Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care and honor Jason C. Fisher, MD. As a champion for Sala’s culture of care, Dr. Fisher is profoundly committed to providing the very best surgical care to children and their families. On a night filled with hope and joy, we shared the story of a young family whose newborn daughter’s life was saved by Dr. Fisher and a team of experts at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. Our most special thanks goes to Sala’s co-founders, Trudy Elbaum Gottesman and Robert W. Gottesman, for their visionary leadership to ensure every child and family who comes through our doors receives compassionate, personalized support. One hundred and thirty guests attended the event and celebrated $3,217,155 in fundraising for Sala Institute. These vital funds will directly benefit children who receive care at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital and their families through Sala’s supportive services, resilience programs, partnership programs, and safety and quality initiatives.

For almost three decades, Ellen Banner and her family have supported NYU Langone’s quest to develop innovative lung cancer treatments and provide people with lung cancer with the most comprehensive, compassionate care. Because of the Banner family and the community they have cultivated around their passion for lung cancer research, NYU Langone has made tremendous strides. Meeting the evolving needs of patients The Stephen E. Banner Fund for Lung Cancer Research positions NYU Langone scientists and doctors at the forefront of lung cancer investigations and gives our staff the ability to offer state-of-the-art care and social work, counseling, and advocacy resources to lung cancer patients and their families. About Stephen E. Banner Stephen E. Banner is lovingly remembered as a devoted husband and father to his four children, a loyal and generous friend, and a brilliant lawyer. An honors graduate of Yale College and Harvard Law School, Steve clerked for Judge Irving R. Kaufman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit before moving on to success in the corporate department at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. In 1991, he became a senior executive at the Seagram Company, one of his longtime clients. Renowned among his colleagues for his incisive intellect, quick wit, and personal charisma, Steve was also the kind of man who would go out of his way to help mentor young associates or write silly rhymed verse for his friends’ birthdays. Never happier than when he was with his wife and children, he tended to downplay his own considerable professional accomplishments in favor of his kids’ triumphs. His warmth and joie de vivre still inspire all who knew him. The Stephen E. Banner Professorship in Thoracic Oncology This endowed professorship funds the work of surgeon-scientist Harvey Pass, MD, as he seeks new ideas in lung cancer research and educates the next generation of leading physicians in the field. A Letter from Ellen Banner Dear Friends, More than 25 years ago, my family and I established the Stephen E. Banner Fund for Lung Cancer Research in loving memory of my husband, Steve. Over the years, the Banner Fund has galvanized NYU Langone’s efforts to ultimately eradicate lung cancer while easing its burden on patients today. Since its inception, the Banner Fund—along with the Stephen E. Banner Professorship in Thoracic Oncology—has allowed us to raise over $10 million to foster the pioneering investigations of Harvey Pass, MD, who currently holds the professorship, Abraham Chachoua, MD, and their colleagues at the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center. With help from the Banner Fund, NYU Langone can fulfill its commitment to discovery and innovation, and provide crucial support for educational and wellness services for patients and families. One of our most recent accomplishments is a new series of videos designed to help individuals and their loved ones cope with the disease and the treatment process. Understanding Lung Cancer captures the compassion, enthusiasm, and unwavering dedication of the lung cancer team and reflects the gratitude of individuals who have received superb care. The doctors and staff at NYU Langone work tirelessly to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients, and the Banner Fund serves as a vital resource.

Gulmi View All 71 Doctors & 71 New Chief of Surgical Oncology Named by NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island Robotic Surgery Offers Advanced Approach to Cardiac Tumors Robots Lend a Hand (or Four) in Brooklyn Operating Room Advanced Diagnostics & Robotic Surgery Treat Prostate Cancer Robotic surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery during which doctors use very small surgical instruments that fit into a patient’s body through a series of tiny incisions. These instruments are mounted on three robotic arms, allowing a surgeon maximum range and precision of motion as he or she performs the procedure. A fourth arm holds a high-definition, three-dimensional camera that enhances visualization—magnifying the tissue and structures of the body tenfold—and guides the surgeon during the procedure. NYU Langone surgeons control their instruments and camera at a console in the operating room. Using finger and foot controls, they operate all four arms of the robot while looking through a stereoscopic, high-definition monitor. The robot translates the surgeon’s hand, wrist, and finger movements to guide each instrument in real-time, after scaling each movement down to size. For example, a one-inch movement may be scaled down to a quarter-inch, allowing extraordinary surgical precision and operative control. Potential Benefits of Robotic Surgery Because robotic surgery requires very small incisions, appropriately selected patients can benefit from less surgical trauma, minimal scarring, and faster recovery times than with traditional open surgery. Our surgical systems, the da Vinci Si—and our latest surgical robot, the da Vinci Xi—offer key features to improve the safety and effectiveness of robotic surgery procedures, including the following: the system’s two high-definition cameras provide the surgeon with a magnified view of the surgical site, combing very accurate depth perception with a 40 percent sharper image than previous systems an additional arm can be used to hold a retractor or other surgical instrument, giving the surgeon more operating capability instant image referencing lets the surgeon display diagnostic images, such as ultrasound or CT scan images of the area taken prior to surgery, on the da Vinci Si/Xi® monitor, alongside the surgeon’s view of the surgery being performed enhanced near-infrared imaging can be used during surgery to distinguish abnormal tissue from normal tissue and evaluate blood flow in real time extra mobile “wrist action,” with mechanical wrists that can hold an array of specialized surgical instruments and function like a human’s, but with an even greater range of motion scalability that allows the surgeon to calibrate the robot’s arm to move a fraction of an inch for every inch the surgeon’s hand moves, a feature that simplifies the most complex movements, including delicate removals as well as suturing and knot-tying Our Robotic Technology In 2008, NYU Langone became the first medical center in New York or New Jersey with the da Vinci Si surgical robot, the world’s most advanced computer-assisted surgical system at the time. Since then, we have added six more systems to the Robotic Surgery Center and were the first New York City hospital with the latest generation robotic surgical system, the da Vinci Xi. This newest robot offers broader capabilities than prior generations of the da Vinci surgical system and allows us to perform a wider range of minimally invasive procedures. NYU Langone’s experienced and highly skilled robotic surgeons use sophisticated, minimally invasive techniques to treat people who have a range of complex cancers and tumors. The types of cancer for which we are able to use robotic surgery include cancers of the digestive and gastrointestinal tract gynecologic cancers head and neck cancers urologic cancers . Our surgeons collaborate with specialists at NYU Langone’s to determine if you require further treatment after surgery. Our Expertise in Robotic Lung Cancer Surgery Our thoracic surgeons perform several different robotic procedures in people with early stages of lung cancer, including , and posterior mediastinal tumors. We also work with select patients who have been successfully treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy and may benefit from surgery. As national leaders in a range of robotic-assisted surgeries that are used to manage several types of lung cancer, NYU Langone is one of the few institutions in the country to offer robotic lobectomies, or removal of a lobe of the lung. Our Expertise in Robotic Gynecologic Cancer Surgery Our gynecologic oncologists have vast experience in performing robotic-assisted surgery to manage gynecologic cancers, including early , fallopian tube cancer, and . Robotic surgery approaches result in faster recovery time for patients. This helps patients to return to their normal activities more quickly or begin chemotherapy or radiation treatment sooner, if it is recommended. Our surgeons use advanced techniques, such as near-infrared imaging when performing sentinel node biopsies in women who have cervical cancer, which allows them to better identify lymph nodes, remove only the most necessary lymph nodes, and reduce the short- and long-term side effects from lymph node dissection. We also play a key leadership role in the training of other surgeons to perform safe robotic surgical procedures. Our Expertise in Robotic Colorectal Cancer Surgery Our surgical oncologists and colorectal surgeons are experts in the use of robotic approaches to manage colon and rectal cancers . Their expertise in using the most advanced robotic technology enables them to remove tumors while minimizing trauma to the patient. Whenever possible, they also use nerve-sparing surgical techniques that preserve sphincter, bladder, and sexual function. Our Expertise in Robotic Urologic Cancer Surgery We have a robotic uro-oncology team that includes urologic surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and radiologists. Our specialties include: penile cancer ureteral cancer We are known internationally for our expertise in kidney-sparing surgery, known as partial nephrectomy, when treating people who have kidney cancer. We’ve also developed specialized techniques using advanced imaging to minimize trauma to the kidney during surgery. This leads to less blood loss and shorter hospital stays. Each year, more than 100 surgeons from around the world come to NYU Langone to observe our advanced robotic techniques for managing kidney cancer. We are cofounders of the largest kidney cancer database in the world and have published two landmark studies on the safety and effectiveness of robotic partial nephrectomy. The studies showed that robotic partial nephrectomy is more effective than laparoscopic surgery at managing kidney cancer. We offer fluorescence imaging for managing kidney cancer surgery, which gives us a more detailed picture of kidney blood flow and allows us to more clearly distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous tissue. Robotic surgery techniques for have advanced, allowing both total and partial removal of the bladder to be done in a minimally invasive way. This can reduce trauma, blood loss, and wound-related complications. NYU Langone was the first and currently the only institution in New York City to offer robotic bladder removal and robotic reconstruction of a new bladder. We pioneered many of the robotic-assisted surgical techniques used around the world today to treat cancers of the ureter, the tube that connects the bladder to the kidneys. Whenever possible, we focus on removing the affected ureter while preserving the kidney. Our team has also pioneered the use of robotic surgery techniques and fluorescence imaging to perform lymph node removal for advanced testis and penile cancer. These advances have dramatically reduced pain, length of hospital stay, and surgery-related complications for our patients. We use one of the world’s largest and most experienced advanced MRI imaging and biopsy programs to maximize outcomes during robotic prostate cancer surgery. Our goal is to manage the cancer while preserving sexual and urinary function. Obstetrics & Gynecology View All Locations (26) We have locations throughout New York City and Long Island.

More than 2 million Americans live with epilepsy, a debilitating condition with no cure. To work toward a future free of epilepsy, scientists need funding that allows them to continue their pioneering studies. In the meantime, patients and families need excellent care and support to ensure the best possible quality of life. The heart of FACES is people: our doctors, nurses, neuropsychologists, scientists, technicians, and administrators—and most importantly the people we care for, their families, and friends. FACES (Finding a Cure for Epilepsy and Seizures) enables faculty and staff at NYU Langone’s Comprehensive Epilepsy Center to advance exceptional clinical care, cutting-edge research, ongoing patient education, and community support programs for children, adults, families, and caregivers who live with epilepsy and seizures. Funding through FACES gives our experts the ability to launch significant studies, such as an exploration of the immune system’s role in epilepsy. It allows them to develop new methods of delivering medications directly to the brain and fosters their efforts to devise the latest surgical techniques. At the same time, FACES improves quality of life for patients and families through special opportunities like Game Day, need-based college scholarships for patients, the Peace of Mind no-cost lecture series, the annual Epilepsy Conference, educational DVDs, parent network support program, and much more. Your generosity toward FACES means we can move even more quickly toward a cure for epilepsy and seizures, while providing the best care and support to our patients today.

We’re Giving New Yorkers What They Expect—The Very Best At NYU Langone, we never stop pushing ourselves. Our patients depend on it, our leadership expects it, and our people—doctors, students, scientists, and supporters—embrace it. It’s what we’ve always done—but over the past decade, we’ve taken it to another level. Our commitment has made us a leader in healthcare and earned us the highest rankings, including No. 1 in New York and No. 3 in the nation on ’s “Best Hospitals.” NYU School Grossman of Medicine is ranked No. 2 out of 185 schools nationwide for research by ’ “Best Medical Schools.” We’ve been hailed by publications including Harvard Business Review Modern Healthcare as a model for the hospital of the 21st century. And, most importantly of all, our care is better than ever: for the past five years, we’ve received top rankings for overall patient safety and quality of care from Vizient, Inc., formerly the University HealthSystem Consortium. Some might look at that progress and call it a mission accomplished. We call it a good start. With Your Support, There’s So Much More We Can Do This is one of the most remarkable times in NYU Langone’s history, but our vision for the future holds even more promise. We’re breaking down the barriers to high-quality healthcare by establishing more community-based clinics and practices. We’re committing $750 million to accelerate research breakthroughs in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other epidemics. And we’re supporting the next generation of leaders in medicine by providing full-tuition scholarships for all MD degree students, regardless of financial need.

Cancer Patients Need a Cure and the Best Care Now For the more than 1.6 million Americans diagnosed with cancer every year, the best outcomes will depend on access to the latest treatments. Since the 1970s, five-year survival rates across all cancers have jumped from 49 to 68 percent because of innovations in care—the result of groundbreaking laboratory and clinical research. But a steady decline in federal research dollars means that crucial questions about how to eradicate cancer remain unanswered. Our Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center is one of the few institutions in the Northeast designated a National Cancer Institute cancer center, and our faculty and staff are poised to make great strides in research and care. In an unprecedented partnership, we’re collaborating with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology on numerous cancer research projects. This global alliance will translate into enhanced detection, diagnosis, and treatment for oncology patients everywhere. We’re also focused on transforming lives today. More than 18 percent of our patients participate in therapeutic clinical trials and research studies—exceeding the national average of 4 percent—and, because of our new Cancer Clinical Trials Office, that number is steadily increasing. Clinical trials fast-track innovations from bench to bedside, while making sure everyone we care for has access to the most promising medical advances now. I believe that we’re going to cure cancer, if not within my lifetime, then within the lifetimes of young clinicians that we’re recruiting. We researchers are optimistic… we are at the dawn of a new era of personalized medicine. Benjamin Neel, MD Director, Perlmutter Cancer Center The generosity of our partners and friends has a tangible impact on the lives of those we serve and their families—and on the future of care. Ensure the Best Care for Those We Serve Today at Perlmutter Cancer Center Your gift will support our groundbreaking efforts to better understand and treat bone, joint, and connective tissue disorders and injuries. Great Orthopedic Care Is Now More Crucial Than Ever Musculoskeletal diseases and conditions are the leading cause of disability in the United States. One in four Americans experiences chronic back pain alone. And the full spectrum of orthopedic issues costs our nation a staggering $874 billion annually in treatment and lost wages. These health and financial burdens will only continue to grow as our population ages. Because of You, We’re Leading the Way We want every person with orthopedic problems to live a full life, free of disability and pain. With more than 150 years of leadership in the field, NYU Langone’s faculty and staff in the musculoskeletal arena practice truly integrated, personalized medicine by working collaboratively to fine-tune medications and treatment approaches in real time. In just the past three years, our caregivers and scientists translated research findings into clinical care that reduced patient readmission by half. We reached No. 4 nationally for orthopedics in ’s most recent “Best Hospitals” rankings, and we are among the top 10 recipients of National Institutes of Health funding in this area. We are also New York’s only hospital to rank among the top 10 nationally in every musculoskeletal subspecialty. It takes a whole host of people—not just surgeons—to provide truly comprehensive patient-centered orthopedic care—everyone from nurses to the security guard at the front door when you arrive for surgery. Joseph D. Zuckerman, MD Orthopedic Surgeon Your generosity will allow us to continue to excel in research, education, and care—for the good of our patients and patients worldwide.

Our interview and filming policies help to ensure the privacy and safety of our patients and to protect the interests and reputation of NYU Langone. A member of the media includes anyone engaged in the acquisition of news with the intent of disseminating it through legitimate and recognized mediums. Recognized mediums used to disseminate news and information include TV, radio, newspaper, magazine, books, documentary film/video productions, the internet, and various wireless delivery formats. Also included, but not limited to, are those supporting the press, including camera crews, set-up crews, lighting crews, makeup artists, and photographers. Learn more about our interview and filming policies below. Media Requests for Patient Information NYU Langone is committed to ensuring the privacy and safety of our patients, and this policy governs when a member of the media requests information about a patient. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to ensure the privacy and safety of our patients and comply with local, state, and federal laws relating to patient privacy as well as to ensure that if patient information is provided to the media, it is consistent with all other existing or future medical center policies. Guidelines The following guidelines will apply to all NYU Langone faculty and staff and to all members of the media engaged in the acquisition of news with the intent of disseminating it through legitimate and recognized mediums requesting information about a patient: Requests for patient information by a representative of the media must be made through the Office of Communications and Marketing by calling the Office of Communications and Marketing Monday through Friday between 9:00AM and 5:30PM at 212-404-3555 . Requests may also be made via email to . After-hours and weekend requests should also be directed to . A recorded message will give the phone number of the public relations manager on duty. General patient condition information may only be provided by the Office of Communications and Marketing, and then only within the limitations imposed by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA generally requires the patient or their personal representative to consent to disclosures. In order to obtain this information, a patient name is required. Medical conditions will be reported as follows: Good, Fair, Serious, Critical, or Undetermined. Stable is not a condition and should only be used to clarify a condition (e.g., patient is critical but vital signs are stable). In event of a large-scale disaster, we will attempt to provide non-specific information about patients brought to NYU Langone. The American Hospital Association recommends the following one-word descriptions of a patient's general condition: Undetermined: Patient awaiting physician assessment. Good: Vital signs are stable and within normal limits. Patient is conscious and comfortable. Indicators are excellent. Fair: Vital signs are stable and within normal limits. Patient is conscious but may be uncomfortable. Indicators are favorable. Serious: Vital signs may be unstable and not within normal limits. Patient is acutely ill. Indicators are questionable. Critical: Vital signs are unstable and not within normal limits. Patient may be unconscious. Indicators are unfavorable. Treated and released: Received treatment but not admitted. Treated and transferred: Received treatment. Transferred to a different facility. A patient name is required. Release of detailed information or information about minors requires written consent of the parent, guardian, or legal representative. NYU Langone’s privacy obligations do not end with a patient’s death. The same privacy rules apply after a patient has died. If consent has been obtained and the next of kin has been notified, NYU Langone may disclose that a patient is “deceased.” However, NYU Langone may not provide any information about the death, including date, time, or cause. Federal and state statutes place additional restrictions on psychiatric patients, those who are HIV positive and those who are undergoing treatment for drug or alcohol abuse. NYU Langone may not disclose any information concerning a patient who is undergoing treatment for these conditions, including any information about their presence at the medical center. Law enforcement officials, Administration for Child Services, and parents or guardians may ask that no information be released about a child. In such cases, communications officials cannot confirm or deny that a no-information patient is located at our facility, nor can we provide condition reports. Patient privacy rules apply even though information may be a matter of public record or public knowledge. Without express written consent by the patient or guardian, NYU Langone may not disclose protected health information to the media even though the same information may be found in public records or has been reported elsewhere. HIPAA generally requires the patient or their personal representative to consent to disclosures. In emergency situations, the hospital may not be able to obtain the patient’s consent because the patient is unconscious or incapable of giving consent. Accordingly, NYU Langone may not be able to disclose any information to the media in the immediate aftermath of an emergency because there has not been time to obtain the consent from the patient or the patient’s representative.

In these procedures, evidence-based pain management and rapid recovery protocols are combined with robotic and computer-assisted surgical tools. Robotic tools make precise movements that preserve bone and tissue and often result in a faster recovery and less muscle and soft tissue damage. Computer-assisted surgery uses technology such as robots, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors, which help doctors properly position implants. Our focus on enhanced recovery and a personalized approach to pain management—that may include a combination of opioid and non-opioid pain relievers and topical medications—enables many of our patients to return home the same day of their robotic or computer-assisted surgery. Robotic Hip Replacement Surgery Our doctors use robotic hip replacement surgery to treat osteoarthritis, developmental hip dysplasia hip impingement syndrome , and conditions causing severe joint damage. The goal of the surgery is to relieve pain and improve mobility. The most important factor in hip replacement surgery, in terms of pain, function, and recovery, is surgical technique. Precise surgical techniques that limit soft tissue damage are key to a rapid recovery. Accurate bone surface preparation with customized biomechanical restoration of the hip determines the function, comfort, and longevity of your implant. Robotic surgical techniques allow surgeons to remove only as much bone as is necessary. The robot system also ensures that the new replacement parts are aligned at the correct angles, which vary with every patient. Hip replacement surgery requires a surgeon to remove damaged bone and cartilage and replace these with synthetic materials, which can affect limb length. Using robotic and computer-assisted tools helps restore your leg length and preserves your comfort and gait. Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery Total knee replacement or partial knee replacement is a common treatment for severe knee pain resulting from osteoarthritis osteonecrosis . Partial knee replacements are a less invasive alternative for people who have experienced damage to one area of their knee as a result of arthritis. Total or partial knee replacement surgery is a technically demanding surgery. Minor instability, common with traditional surgical techniques, has been recognized as a main source of patient dissatisfaction and early failure. Alignment and balance are the two main requirements for clinical success in knee replacement surgery. Proper alignment requires precise surgical planning and execution, such as those that robotic techniques deliver. Correct balancing with pressure sensors results in a natural-feeling joint that functions well during recreational sports and activities. Robotics, computer-assisted surgical tools, and pressure sensor technology deliver information our surgeons need during total and partial knee replacement surgery to ensure your walking weight is distributed evenly. NYU Langone experts have been key developers of these technologies and continue to work toward advancing this field, while training fellows and visiting surgeons in the safe adoption of these innovative techniques. Robotic and computer-assisted surgeries for bone and joint conditions take place at Robotic orthopedic surgery is performed by the following doctors: Matthew Hepinstall, MD , Co-Director Morteza Meftah, MD Patrick Meere, MD, Co-Director We have locations in Manhattan, and we offer virtual appointments. 646-987-3850 We provide care during pregnancy and treatment for all gynecologic conditions. At the Center for Midlife Health and Menopause, we help women manage their health and optimize their wellbeing during the transition. Our clinicians provide treatment and support for symptoms related to menopause, as well as education about its impact on your overall health. The menopause life stage starts with perimenopause, which usually begins in your 40s but can vary. The complete transition to menopause, defined as 12 months after a final menstrual period, happens over a decade or longer. The average age of menopause is 52. At the Center for Midlife Health and Menopause, housed in the state-of-the-art NYU Langone Ambulatory Care Center East 53rd Street, a hub for women’s health and wellness, we offer comprehensive and compassionate care during the menopause transition. We also provide treatment for induced menopause, in which the ovaries stop providing estrogen due to radiation therapy, certain drug treatments, or surgical removal. The Patient Experience During perimenopause, estrogen and progesterone levels become irregular. While these hormonal changes are completely normal, they can cause symptoms that vary in intensity and duration. Before your first visit, we ask you to fill out a detailed questionnaire to help us understand your symptoms and how the transition is affecting your everyday life. We ask about your experience with a variety of signs of the menopause transition, such as period changes, hot flushes, night sweats, sleep issues, difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, bone and joint issues, bladder and vaginal concerns, and changes in sexual health. The decrease in estrogen that accompanies menopause increases the risk of certain health conditions. We provide screening and guidance to help you reduce the risk of these conditions, which include osteoporosis , and urinary and vaginal issues. Your first visit is a 45-minute consultation, held either in person or through a virtual visit. During this session, we review your symptoms, discuss treatment options, and create a customized care plan. Follow-up appointments are scheduled as needed to ensure that your symptoms have been addressed. Treatment Options and Referrals Each treatment plan is customized to your specific symptoms. Potential therapies include hormonal and nonhormonal treatments as well as complementary therapies such as lifestyle and dietary interventions. We rely on the latest scientific research regarding hormone therapy and prescribe it when it is the best treatment option, and individualize our therapies to maximize your health and wellbeing. We also offer referrals to NYU Langone specialists for issues that often accompany menopause and are more likely to occur in midlife, including bone loss, , and pelvic floor disorders. In addition, our Creating Healthy Activity and Nutrition Goals for Empowering CHANGE program explains how diet, exercise, sleep, and other lifestyle choices can help you deal with perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms.

We also surgically manage and other aortic conditions. Our doctors aim to preserve the aortic valve whenever possible, rather than replacing it with an artificial one. Natural valve tissue tends to last longer than an artificial valve, making preservation especially beneficial to younger patients. Experts in Aortic Aneurysm Surgery Our doctors specialize in repairing aortic aneurysms that can be especially dangerous. These include aortic root, aortic arch, and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Aortic Root Aneurysm Repair The aortic root is closest to the heart. In addition to the risk of aortic dissection, an aneurysm on the aortic root can also damage the aortic valve. We are one of the top centers with expertise in repairing aneurysms in the aortic root without aortic valve replacement, a procedure known as valve-sparing aortic root replacement Aortic Arch Aneurysm Repair An aortic arch aneurysm occurs in the section where the artery curves up and away from the heart. The aortic arch connects to vessels that supply blood to the head and arms. Aortic arch aneurysms usually require surgery to replace the arch and vessels, or a hybrid procedure that includes open surgery followed by a stent graft—a fabric-covered mesh tube that seals and strengthens the wall of the aorta, allowing the aneurysm to shrink. The stent is placed with a minimally invasive procedure known as endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) . We also perform aneurysm repair in patients who previously had this surgery at another institution but who had poor results. Thoracoabdominal Aneurysm Repair A thoracoabdominal aneurysm occurs in the portion of the aorta that extends from the chest and abdomen, where numerous vessels supply blood to the liver, kidneys, intestines, and spine. When this portion of the aorta needs to be repaired or replaced, there is a risk of reduced blood flow to these areas. Our surgeons have extensive experience in the techniques used to create bypasses that maintain blood flow to these organs and the spine. They may use EVAR to shore up the aorta, while also allowing blood to flow through its connected veins and to vital organs. The Latest Approaches to Aortic Dissection Our expertise in the care of complex aortic aneurysms translates to treatment for all types of aortic dissection . We use minimally invasive endovascular approaches, open surgery , and a hybrid of the two to create treatment strategies for each patient’s individual diagnosis. Leaders in Aortic Valve Disease Surgery For aortic valve disease, our surgeons may recommend repairing the aortic valve to preserve your own tissue. If you are not a candidate for an aortic valve repair, we offer methods of aortic valve replacement. The Ross Procedure We are one of the leading centers in New York City to offer the Ross procedure, an innovative approach to aortic valve disease that is particularly suited for young, active people. The Ross procedure relies on the body’s natural tissue to repair the aortic valve. It is a durable, long-term option for valve replacement that avoids dependence on blood thinners, which are needed when an artificial valve is used. Aortic Valve Replacement Surgery If a procedure using natural tissue is not an option for you, our doctors may offer open . Our surgeons may use a bioprosthetic valve, which is made from either a cow (bovine) or pig (porcine) tissue, or a mechanical valve, made of metal. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement We also offer , also known as TAVR, a minimally invasive approach to aortic valve disease. Advanced Surgical Facilities offers single-bed inpatient rooms, providing more comfort and privacy for patients. It is one of the most digitally integrated and sophisticated inpatient facilities in the country, designed to maximize the level of care for each patient.

We offer a range of tests that can diagnose early heart disease and assess the risk factors that predispose a person to heart disease and The tests we offer include the following: 24-Hour Blood Pressure Monitoring Blood pressure readings taken during an office visit may be abnormally high—“white coat” hypertension—or falsely low, called masked hypertension. To determine whether patients have high blood pressure and require treatment, we provide them with a portable device that records their blood pressure over a 24-hour period. Advanced Lipid Profile An advanced lipid profile test gives us a more accurate picture of your risk for cardiovascular disease than the standard lipid profile test taken during an annual physical. With an advanced lipid profile test, we can measure the individual particle size and numbers that make up LDL (bad) and HDL (good) cholesterol, which can better predict your risk for heart disease and stroke. This test may be particularly beneficial for people already on statins, those with or prediabetes, and for people with a family history of early heart disease or stroke. Ankle-Brachial Index The ankle-brachial index test measures the blood pressure in the arm and then compares it with the blood pressure in different segments of the legs to screen for , which may indicate atherosclerosis in the arteries of the aorta or lower extremities. The test is useful for determining decreased blood flow, even at early stages of disease, which can change the course of treatment. Carotid Intimal-Medial Thickness Evaluation Carotid intimal-medial thickness (IMT) evaluation is used to measure the thickness of the wall of the carotid artery in your neck. The thickening of the carotid artery or the presence of plaque can identify early vascular disease, which increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Coronary Calcium Scoring In a coronary calcium scoring test, are taken of the heart to detect the amount of calcified plaque on your coronary artery walls. Plaque can block blood flow to your heart and be an indicator of early cardiovascular disease. High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein A blood test can detect increased levels of a protein known as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), which may signal inflammation in your arteries. This inflammation may contribute to atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, and increase your risk of heart attack or stroke. Advanced Lipoprotein (a) Testing About one in five people have elevated lipoprotein (a), also known as Lp(a), an inherited, independent risk factor for early heart disease and stroke. Lp(a) testing is a blood test that is particularly beneficial for people with a family history of early heart disease, and for people with heart disease but no known cardiovascular risk factors. Metabolic Panel People with metabolic disorders such as diabetes and prediabetes are at greater risk of early heart disease and blood clotting. Early detection of abnormal metabolic health can guide lifestyle changes and medication therapy to help prevent diabetes and serious diabetes-related health problems. Thrombosis Screening Thrombosis, or blood clots, contribute to heart attacks, strokes, vascular disease in the legs, and sudden cardiac death. Blood tests can identify underlying causes of blood clots or otherwise unexplained vascular disease. Vascular Health Screening Abnormal vascular function is sometimes the first sign of cardiovascular disease and may demonstrate that disease has already started to affect the arteries. People with abnormal vascular function are at heightened risk for heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events. Monitoring vascular health over time may be useful in helping to assess the effectiveness of certain therapies. , we know that proper nutrition is critical to maintaining and improving your cardiovascular health. Through our Heart Healthy Nutrition Program, we help you improve your overall wellness.

Heffron helps people of all fitness levels safely start and maintain an exercise program. Our program is led by Dr. , a cardiologist with specialized training in exercise physiology. Dr. Heffron assesses your history with exercise, current fitness level, and medical status to develop a plan to improve your cardiovascular health through physical activity and focused exercise. He provides practical advice on starting and maintaining an exercise program and recommendations on the right types of exercise for you. This is done in collaboration with your doctor and dietitian and with specialized attention to your cardiovascular health history. Schedule an exercise consultation with Dr. Heffron or call Sports Cardiology Service Dr. Heffron has teamed up with cardiology services through NYU Langone Sports Health to provide specialized care for athletes and active people of all ages. This includes specialized care for athletes with heart conditions and athletes who are predisposed to developing a heart condition, including people who have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or other lipid disorders. The team at NYU Langone’s Cardiovascular Thrombosis Program offers comprehensive care to patients with inherited or acquired clotting disorders, backed by the latest research available. Our team is actively involved with clinical trials and regularly collaborates with expert investigators, clinicians, and statisticians from NYU Langone’s to bring you the most innovative and effective care possible. A thrombosis is an excessive or dangerous blood clot that forms in a vein or artery. If you develop a blood clot, you may have many questions about why it occurred, the possibility of it happening again, and how to prevent it from reoccurring. Our team of specialists provides complete evaluation, diagnosis, and disease management services for people with clotting conditions or who currently have a blood clot. We treat patients with a variety of thrombotic conditions, including: hypercoagulable conditions, where your blood clots too much platelet hyperreactivity, or sticky platelet syndrome venous thromboembolic events, where the blood clots in the venous system, such as deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism arterial clotting, such as heart attack or graft or stent thrombosis, which is clotting around a prior stent or a bypass graft unexplained clotting disorders We also offer assistance in preventing excessive coagulation of your blood before, during, and after surgery, and the management of antiplatelet therapies, which are medicines that stop blood platelets from sticking together and clotting. We perform platelet testing, coagulation testing, and genetic testing to help guide anticlotting strategies, and develop a treatment plan tailored especially for you. Dr. Jeffrey S. Berger is an internationally renowned expert in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of clotting disorders. Venous Thromboembolic Center We offer superior care for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism through streamlined diagnosis and treatment. Heart Programs Our cardiothoracic surgeons and interventional cardiologists are leaders in cardiovascular care, specializing in minimally invasive procedures and surgery for conditions that affect the aorta, arteries, valves, veins, and heart. Our team of cardiologists can help you lower your risk for heart attack, stroke, and other cardiac and vascular conditions. Our doctors provide complete diagnosis and treatment plans for people with inherited heart rhythm conditions. Vein Center We offer minimally invasive vein treatments that our surgeons can perform in our offices. 212-263-4310 We see patients in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and on Long Island. TAVR Experts Our interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons have performed more than 5,000 transcatheter aortic valve replacements, among the most in the U.S. Leaders in MitraClip We’re busiest in the Northeast for transcatheter mitral valve procedures, and have performed more than 500 MitraClip® procedures. Interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons at NYU Langone’s Transcatheter Heart Valve Program are among the most experienced in the country at performing nonsurgical procedures to repair and replace heart valves. We are leaders in mitral valve repair with MitraClip , transcatheter mitral valve replacement, and triscuspid valve repair and replacement. During a transcatheter procedure, we use a blood vessel in the leg to access the heart valve. After this nonsurgical treatment, people live longer, experience improved quality of life, and have fewer symptoms of heart valve disease, including shortness of breath, than people whose valves are not repaired or replaced. In many cases, transcatheter procedures are safer than traditional open heart surgery, which requires a large incision and longer recovery time. , we also partner with surgeons at the , who use minimally invasive and robotic techniques to treat mitral valve disease. Our TAVR Expertise Our heart experts have performed more than 5,000 TAVR procedures—among the most in the country—to treat people with . We are pioneers in the field and were the first in the world to perform an advanced type of TAVR using the new Medtronic CoreValve™ Evolut™ R Pro System. Our survival rates are among the best in the country, and most patients require only a one-day hospital stay, compared with a national average of three days. Procedures are performed using conscious sedation, which uses a sedative and an anesthetic to relax you and block any pain, and has a faster recovery period than general anesthesia. Nearly all of our patients—96 percent—go home the day after procedure. Only 4 percent require a pacemaker after the procedure, and the risk of or death is less than 1 percent. This far exceeds national averages. Our TAVR team in Manhattan is led by Dr. Mathew R. Williams , who has performed more TAVR procedures than any surgeon in the country. Procedures are performed in our state-of-the-art hybrid operating rooms at NYU Langone’s , which features single-bedded rooms for all of our patients. TAVR is an option for many people who need treatment for aortic valve disease. This includes those classified as high-risk who for medical reasons would not be a candidate for open heart surgery, as well as people who are considered low-risk for complications due to their relatively young age and overall good health. We are pioneers in the use of TAVR in low-risk patients, and were part of the clinical trial that made the treatment available to this group. Our doctors work with you to determine whether TAVR is the best treatment for you. If another approach is better suited to your condition, our surgeons are also experts in all forms of cardiac valve surgery, including open heart surgery, and our outcomes exceed national averages. We also perform aortic balloon valvuloplasty, a transcatheter technique that is an option for some people who are not candidates for TAVR. Excellence in Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair We offer nonsurgical mitral valve repair, including with MitraClip , to treat , and perform more of these procedures than any program in the Northeast. is a device that helps the valve’s flaps, or leaflets, to close more effectively. MitraClip is available for people with degenerative mitral valve regurgitation brought on by conditions such as mitral valve prolapse, or functional mitral regurgitation that is a result of the overworked heart growing larger and pulling at the leaflets so they do not form a proper seal. During the MitraClip procedure, your doctor accesses the mitral valve using a small incision in the groin. A clip is threaded through a catheter, and doctors place the device on the mitral valve. This reduces and in some cases eliminates regurgitation. Because of our vast experience, our doctors can perform a MitraClip procedure twice as quickly as most centers. A shorter procedure time reduces the risk of complications, and our patients are usually up and walking a couple of hours after the procedure and are back home the next day. Most of our patients experience a significant reduction in regurgitation, which relieves symptoms, increases longevity, and improves quality of life. In addition to MitraClip , we also perform mitral balloon valvuloplasty for people who have mitral valve stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease. We are also involved in numerous new technologies that are being developed to treat this condition. Advanced Mitral Valve Replacement transcatheter mitral valve replacement , in which our doctors guide a new valve through a catheter to the heart, where it can take over the work of the diseased valve. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is available for people for are at high risk or are not candidates for open heart surgery, or those who have had prior mitral valve replacement and are in need of a new valve. NYU Langone is a pioneer in the use of transcatheter mitral valve replacement, and our doctors actively participate in clinical trials for investigational devices. All patients are screened to determine which device is most suitable to their diagnosis. Tricuspid Valve Repair and Replacement Tricuspid valve regurgitation occurs when the valve between the heart’s right atrium and right ventricle does not close properly. If severe and left untreated, patients with triscupid valve regurgitation may develop shortness of breath, swelling in the stomach, leg swelling, and pulmonary hypertension, all of which can be debilitating. We are currently enrolling high-risk surgical patients in clinical trials using new transcatheter tricuspid valve repair and replacement devices. We are located at NYU Langone’s in Manhattan. We also see patients at the following locations in Brooklyn, Queens, and on Long Island: To make an appointment at any of our locations, please call Our valve specialists provide the most appropriate treatment for your heart valve condition, including transcather procedures, open heart surgery, or watchful waiting. Director, Heart Valve Center Alan F. Vainrib Nonsurgical Heart Procedure Saves Mom During Pregnancy NYU Langone orthopedic experts provide surgical and nonsurgical treatments for people experiencing athletic-related or traumatic injuries, as well as degenerative conditions affecting the shoulder and elbow. These include rotator cuff injuries, dislocation and instability issues, , and fractures. Our surgeons are dedicated to the treatment of shoulder and elbow conditions, from sprains and strains to reconstructive surgery and joint replacement. Conditions we provide treatment for include: dislocated shoulder (shoulder instability), which occurs when the top of the upper arm bone becomes disengaged from the shoulder socket elbow sprain and fracture frozen shoulder , which is the tightening of the shoulder joint that makes it painful to move the arm golfer’s elbow, pain in the bone on the inner side of the elbow labral tear , an injury to the tissue that holds the arm in place little league elbow, pain in the elbow joint that occurs in young baseball players before the age of puberty shoulder tendinitis , tendinopathy, or tendinosis, also called tennis shoulder, which are tiny tears or inflammation in the tendons that connect the shoulder to the muscles of the rotator cuff and biceps shoulder sprain tennis elbow, pain in the bone on the outside of the elbow Procedures we perform include: adhesive capsulitis surgery for frozen shoulder, during which the arm is moved at the shoulder joint to relieve pain and stiffness stabilization shoulder surgery rotator cuff repair , a surgery to fix tears in the muscles of the shoulder and upper arm shoulder replacement and reverse total shoulder replacement, particularly for people with shoulder osteoarthritis tendon repair Female Pelvic Conditions & Treatments If you have a urogynecologic condition, such as recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), , or bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis), you may be searching for an experienced and compassionate doctor to help you. At NYU Langone’s Center for Female Pelvic Medicine, our specialists treat women for a wide range of conditions and provide you with many different treatment approaches. Urinary and Stress Incontinence Urinary incontinence is the unintentional loss of urine. Stress incontinence occurs when a physical activity—such as coughing or sneezing—puts pressure, or stress, on your bladder, causing urine to leak. It results from the weakening of the muscles and tissues that support the bladder. Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles and ligaments that support your pelvic organs weaken over time. The weakening causes the organs—including the bladder, rectum, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes or intestines—to slip out of place, or prolapse. The prolapsed organs then push against the vaginal walls, causing pressure, discomfort, or pain. Bladder Dysfunction Also known as voiding dysfunction, bladder dysfunction occurs when your bladder either does not empty completely, or it empties too frequently or “without permission.” Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections UTIs occur when bacteria invade and multiply in the urinary tract system, which includes the kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra. Women are more susceptible to UTIs than men because of their shorter urinary tracts. Some women experience recurrent UTIs, meaning that they contract the infection three or more times a year. Urologic Consequences of Neurologic Disease Certain neurologic conditions may cause UTIs and bladder dysfunction. A or spinal cord injury or chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis may affect your bladder health as well. Bladder Pain Syndrome Bladder pain syndrome, also known as interstitial cystitis, is a chronic inflammation of the bladder wall that causes severe pain. The cause is unknown and doctors only arrive at a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis after ruling out all other urologic and pelvic conditions. Radiation-Induced Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Women who undergo radiation therapy as part of cancer treatment may find that the radiation leads to urogynecologic problems, such as incontinence, urinary frequency and urgency, difficulty emptying the bladder, and kidney problems. These problems may not occur until many years after radiation therapy is completed. Fistulas of the Urinary Tract A urinary fistula is an abnormal opening between the bladder and vagina, between the urethra and the vagina, or between the ureter and the vagina. Common causes of urinary fistulas include surgery such as a hysterectomy, radiation to the pelvis, or pelvic trauma. The fistulas cause urinary incontinence because the urine flows directly from the bladder or ureter into the vagina. Urethral Diverticulum Urethral diverticulum is a condition in which a small pouch forms next to your urethra. The pouch connects to your urethra and fills with urine, causing pain during or after urination, irritation, dribbling of urine, incontinence, recurrent UTIs, and painful intercourse. Treatments We Offer We offer a variety of treatment options for female pelvic conditions, such as medications, depending on your particular condition. We also work closely with NYU Langone physical therapists and physiatrists, or rehabilitation experts, to help you make lifestyle changes through exercises, weight loss, diet changes, and control of chronic cough, which can help relieve your symptoms. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy to relieve symptoms associated with pelvic floor disorders. Physical therapy can strengthen weakened muscles, improve the flexibility of tight muscles, teach self-care and relaxation techniques, and improve the coordination of your pelvic floor and abdominal muscles. Surgery is a treatment option for a variety of urogynecologic conditions, both common and rare, including , reconstruction of the lower urinary tract and vagina,  urethral dysfunction, and other bladder conditions. If you are concerned about how surgery may affect your fertility, talk to your doctor. There are a number of fertility-sparing surgeries available. We also offer uterine-sparing operations for women who are no longer in their childbearing years. In addition, several of the procedures we offer are so minimally invasive that you do not even need to enter an operating room. These include urethral bulking, a procedure used to manage urinary incontinence in which your doctor injects synthetic materials or collagen around the urethra to augment the urethral wall and increase resistance to urinary flow; transvaginal tape, which can support the middle of the urethra; a pubovaginal sling, which can stop urine leakage; and injections of botulinum toxin (Botox At NYU Langone, our gynecologic surgeons are committed to excellence through expertise. We use minimally invasive surgical techniques like laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery. But the mastery lies in our ability to pair the right procedure with the right patient, ensuring that each person receives a distinct treatment plan best targeted to their individual needs. By using minimally invasive treatments, our patients experience faster recovery times, reduced pain, smaller incisions, and shorter hospital stays. These are some of the conditions we treat: heavy or painful menstrual periods ovarian cysts ovarian remnant syndrome adenomyosis, in which the endometrial lining grows into the muscular wall of the uterus adenomyoma, which is a benign tumor pelvic adhesions cervical insufficiency or incompetence congenital anomalies of the reproductive system NYU Langone gynecologic surgeons use the most advanced laparoscopic and robotic surgical techniques. Our specialists are experienced in urogynecology, pelvic reconstructive surgery, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery, and pediatric and adolescent gynecology. Your care begins with using the most accurate and advanced diagnosis strategies to develop a treatment plan customized to your condition and your care goals. We support our patients with access to fertility services, nutrition guidance, mental health services, and physical therapy. We also address the needs of the LGBTQ+ community, providing respectful and inclusive care that is focused on the whole person. Laparoscopic and robotic procedures use only small incisions and have a shorter recovery time than other methods. Those we perform include the following: excision of endometriosis, including deep, infiltrating endometriosis involving bowel, bladder, and extrapelvic sites myomectomy , the surgical removal of fibroids hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus management of ovarian cysts or masses cerclage, to treat cervical insufficiency and help prevent miscarriage prolapse repair Our gynecologic surgeons use minimally invasive techniques whenever possible to achieve better outcomes for their patients. Hysteroscopic procedures, which use a light scope to examine the cervix and uterus, include the following: resection (removal) of endometrial polyp resection of submucosal fibroid resection of uterine septum lysis of adhesions to treat Asherman’s syndrome endometrial ablation We also perform transcervical fibroid ablation , an ultrasound procedure also known by the brand name Sonata that is used to shrink fibroids. Specialized Surgical Care For people living with endometriosis and fibroids, we offer an integrative care approach that addresses your treatment goals, including preserving or improving fertility. At our , we provide uterine-preserving treatments that include robotic-assisted myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and radiofrequency ablation. Doctors at our specialize in treatments that align with a woman’s fertility goals. This includes conservative, fertility-preserving surgery that removes endometriosis, and hysterectomy that removes the uterus as well as all endometriosis for people who do not wish to maintain future fertility. To optimize patient outcomes, minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons collaborate with other specialists at NYU Langone, including those in reproductive endocrinology, infertility, maternal–fetal medicine, colorectal surgery, urology, vascular surgery, interventional radiology, pain psychology, and physical therapy. Our gynecologic surgeons specialize in minimally invasive laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Patricia Gil Hye-Chun Hur Division Director, Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery We provide the full spectrum of gynecologic care, including family planning, pregnancy, menopause, and treatment for conditions that affect the uterus and reproductive system. NYU Langone’s orthopedic trauma team is the most experienced and highly trained in the New York City area, each year providing urgent and follow-up care to thousands of people with traumatic orthopedic injuries and fractures. We treat people age 16 and older. Our surgeons treat every level of injury, from sprains and fractures to life-threatening trauma.

In addition, our surgeons work as part of the interdisciplinary teams at NYU Langone’s Bone Healing Center Joint Preservation and Arthritis Center Limb Salvage and Restoration Center Doctors at NYU Langone’s Clinical Genetic Services provide the most advanced, compassionate care for people interested in all types of genetic counseling and testing. We offer medical genetics evaluations that can identify and guide treatment of childhood and adult disorders, whether or not they are hereditary If you have been referred for genetic evaluation, you may have questions about the appointment and what tests you may have to take. Our goal is to provide you with an exact diagnosis. We share with you whatever is known about the condition, the cause or pattern of how it is inherited, and the course of the condition. We advise you on treatment options, including preventive measures and testing recommendations, and offer you information about support groups and educational opportunities to learn more about the condition. We may provide you with ongoing care or refer you to another specialist. We provide your referring physician with a detailed letter from our team summarizing your evaluation. Your records and diagnosis are not released to anyone else, nor are they discussed with an individual or group unless you give us specific permission in writing. That includes other family members, professionals from other institutions, and insurance companies. We encourage you to discuss anything that relates to your experience of having a child with a specific condition, your concern about having a hereditary condition yourself, or anything else that may help you feel more comfortable about your particular situation. Genetics Evaluation You may have been referred to us for a genetic evaluation for a number of reasons, including: Your child may have been born with a physical problem and the cause must be determined. Your child may not be developing either physically or mentally as expected for his or her age. You may have a condition that is suspected of being hereditary, or you may have a history of a hereditary condition in your family and want to know about its nature, the possibility for treatment, and the risk to other family members. Some evaluations can be completed in one session; some may require two or more. The entire evaluation may take anywhere from one day to several months. The number of sessions depends on the type of problem and the complexity of the evaluation. Your initial session can be expected to last one to two hours and subsequent visits are usually shorter. We also offer sessions for clinical genetic evaluations and genetic counseling at NYU Langone’s We start your genetic evaluation by getting a detailed family health and medical history and, if appropriate, perform a physical examination. For some patients, it may be important to examine other family members as well. We may recommend tests such as blood analyses and X-rays—though not all patients require tests—and a consultation with other specialists for the most thorough evaluation. Our program is in-network with many medical insurance plans, so please ask when you make your appointment. Most medical insurance plans cover genetic testing, but call your provider to make sure. We are able to get preauthorization for genetic testing under most circumstances—we do not begin testing until we’ve verified that it is covered by your insurance provider. NYU Langone’s orthopedic foot and ankle care program is one of the oldest in the United States, founded more than 45 years ago by a pioneer of the specialty, Dr. Paul Lapidus. Today, we have more than 10,000 patient visits and perform more than 800 surgical procedures each year. Our surgeons handle all conditions and injuries of the foot and ankle. In partnership with doctors at the Diabetic Foot and Ankle Center , we also treat people who have complex orthopedic issues connected to foot-related complications of VIDEO: Dr. John G. Kennedy discusses the different ways we use NanoScope technology to get our patients back on their feet quickly. Ankle replacement is available at . Advanced ankle arthritis may require an ankle fusion, which provides excellent pain relief, but no longer allows you to move your foot at the ankle joint. Total ankle arthroplasty, or ankle replacement, may be an effective option for some people with advanced arthritis to provide both pain relief and preserve motion. We also diagnose and treat people with ankle conditions using the NanoScope arthroscopy imaging system. Using this needle-sized instrument with an image-sensing chip at the tip, our surgeons can see inside the ankle joint to diagnose conditions such as arthritis and cartilage injuries and to perform minimally invasive procedures such as an ankle debridement to remove scar tissue or floating bone fragments. Procedures can be performed with local anesthesia in your doctor’s office, and you can follow along on a screen to get a better sense of what has been causing you pain. Conditions we provide treatment for include the following: Achilles tendonitis , which is inflammation of the tendon that connects the calf muscle to the heel bone foot injuries caused by complications of diabetes, including slow-healing wounds called ulcers foot and ankle arthritis foot, ankle, and toe fractures foot, ankle, and toe sprains caused by a tear in the ligaments hammertoe , or a toe that remains bent high arched foot, a condition in which too much weight is put on the ball of the foot, causing pain and stiffness metatarsalgia, or pain in the ball of the foot plantar fasciitis , inflammation of the tissue attached to the heel bone Procedures we perform include the following: amputation of leg, foot, or toe, often performed because of trauma or injury, infection, tumors, or lack of blood flow ankle fusion ankle replacement arthrodesis of foot and ankle, a procedure used to fuse the two bones together as a way to relieve pain from arthritis and other conditions corrective surgery for bunions , which are caused by excess bone in the area where the big toe connects to the foot fracture reduction, in which screws or other supportive devices are used to repair a broken bone NYU Langone adult reconstructive surgeons specialize in a full spectrum of joint care.

Mild bone loss is referred to as osteopenia, and more severe loss is known as Bone densitometry is an exam used by physicians at NYU Langone to diagnose bone loss. Your doctor may also use it as a tool to follow the results of any treatment initiated to address this bone loss. Preparing for a Bone Density Test You may eat normally on the day of the test. If you are taking calcium supplements, please avoid taking them for 24 hours prior to the exam. Wear loose, comfortable clothing without buttons, zippers, or snaps, if possible. Inform your doctor and the technologist if you have received barium or any other contrast agent or radioisotope during a CT or other scan in the past 10 to 14 days. If so, you may have to reschedule the bone density test for a later time. Please inform your doctor and technologist if there is a chance that you may be pregnant. Prior to having the test, we ask that you fill out this brief bone densitometry screening form During the Bone Density Test The established standard bone density test is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DEXA. Measurements are most commonly taken of your lower spine and both hips. Occasionally, the test may include the bones in the forearm. The exam is performed with you comfortably lying down on your back. During the spinal portion of the examination, your legs are raised and resting on a soft foam cushion, which straightens your spine. When examining your hips, your feet are placed in a brace to rotate your hips inward. The scanner slowly passes above the areas of interest as it collects information that is used to make a diagnosis. The exam usually lasts for about 15 minutes.

U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Hospitals” ranks NYU Langone among the top 10 hospitals in the nation for orthopedics, rheumatology, and rehabilitation. Our goal is to reduce your symptoms, restore joint function, and delay the onset of degenerative arthritis in active people as well as in individuals who want to explore less-invasive alternatives to joint replacement. As a patient at the Joint Preservation and Arthritis Center, your care is followed throughout the course of your condition. Careful monitoring of your progress is vital to pinpointing the right treatment for each person’s specific problem, and to determining when to consider the next step in the treatment process. Whether you have injured your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and are considering ACL reconstruction, injured your cartilage and are contemplating cartilage replacement, or if you have a longstanding history of knee osteoarthritis and are considering total knee replacement, our physicians discuss surgical and nonsurgical options with you, and our recommendations may change as we follow you over time.

At the Joint Preservation and Arthritis Center, we perform clinical studies through NYU Langone’s Musculoskeletal Research Center . Through the Joint Preservation Partnership, we are customizing arthritis care for each patient. Our research program is led by Philip Band, PhD The Joint Preservation Partnership is a program designed to create a lifelong initiative for the management of arthritic conditions, and to maintain joint function in active individuals, regardless of their age. It unites experts within NYU Langone and beyond in studying, educating, treating, and promoting the preservation of joint function through individualized treatment for each patient. Dr. Jonathan Samuels treats a patient. To accomplish this, we are using advanced imaging techniques, biomarkers, and therapies intended to modify the disease process. The unifying goal of the Joint Preservation Partnership is to develop tools for identifying the most appropriate treatment for individual patients at each stage of arthritic disease. By improving arthritis treatment one patient at a time, the Joint Preservation Partnership aims to reduce the overall medical and socioeconomic burden of arthritis. Currently, more than 100 ongoing clinical studies are evaluating new approaches to the treatment of musculoskeletal disease. Collaborations across specialties enable physical therapy techniques, medications, injectable agents, and new surgical techniques to be compared, and properly used to address each patient’s specific problem. Biomarkers are being studied to determine an individual patient’s risk of disease progression, to identify the most appropriate treatment for each patient’s specific problem, and to monitor response to treatment. Useful biomarkers have been found in blood, from advanced MRI scans, and from synovial fluid—the fluid that lubricates and cushions joints. Our researchers have also implemented internet-based systems to foster better communication between patients and clinicians, and as tools to study the comparative effectiveness of alternative treatment strategies. Our skilled physicians provide specialized care for the treatment of conditions of the knee, hip, and shoulder. Jonathan Samuels Natalie E.

Cardiac surgeons from specialize in that uses innovative techniques to restore blood flow through significantly diseased arteries. We are a recognized leader in coronary artery bypass graft procedures and have earned from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons a three-star rating, the highest rating possible. This reflects our patient-centered approach to care before, during, and after surgery, and how well our patients do after the procedure. A Unique Surgical Approach When minimally invasive techniques such as percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting are not enough to restore healthy blood flow to the heart, coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be recommended. This lifesaving procedure is often used to treat or prevent a heart attack. Coronary artery bypass surgery uses vessels from another part of the body to create a bypass around a blockage. For most people, coronary artery bypass graft surgery starts with an incision through the sternum, or breastbone, to access the heart—a procedure called open heart surgery. This approach is used when more than one artery needs a bypass—a double, triple, or quadruple bypass. At NYU Langone, our surgical treatment plans aim to open all blocked arteries during one procedure, a process called complete revascularization. This approach can significantly reduce the risk of future heart attack and may reduce the need for additional procedures later on. We are also pioneers in the use of arteries to create bypasses. Traditional coronary artery bypass graft surgery uses a vein to create a bypass. NYU Langone surgeons specialize in a more complex approach that uses arteries, which are more durable and provide longer-lasting results than vein bypasses, to create new blood pathways to the heart. More than 70 percent of the multiple coronary artery bypass grafts performed at NYU Langone use arterial grafts, a rate that is much higher than the national average of 15 percent, as reported by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Our surgical excellence and high safety standards often result in patients able to get up and walk within hours of surgery, and be back at home after two days of in-hospital monitoring. We know that people are more comfortable recovering at home, and the sooner people can go home, the quicker their overall recovery will be. For people who need only one bypass, we offer robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass graft surgery . This minimally invasive approach does not require opening the breastbone and instead is performed by positioning surgical tools through small incisions placed between the ribs in the left side of the chest. Most people leave the hospital after one to three days. Our surgeons perform more than 500 coronary artery bypass procedures per year at NYU Langone in Manhattan and in Mineola. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery can be performed along with heart valve surgery—to repair or replace damaged aortic mitral valves —and coronary stenting, to open arteries that do not require a bypass. Coronary Artery Bypass Graft for People with Heart Failure NYU Langone offers innovative treatment that combines a temporary transvalvular ventricular assist device with a coronary artery bypass graft for people who have been told that they are not candidates for surgical treatment at other hospitals due to the severity of their illness. It may allow people who have been told they need a to delay the procedure or avoid it altogether. This treatment is for people with advanced whose hearts are working at 25 percent of capacity or less. The surgeon performs the bypass, and then a second procedure is done to place a temporary ventricular assist device that takes over the pumping activity of the heart. The pump is left in place for up to 10 days, giving the heart a chance to heal from the bypass and recover function. After the pump is removed, in a bedside procedure, patients often experience increased heart function and symptom relief. Heart Bypass Surgery Recovery and Support If our patients need cardiac rehabilitation after heart bypass surgery, they are referred through NYU Langone’s . We can also connect you with programs and services that help reverse heart disease, including the Heart Healthy Nutrition Program and Exercise Physiology Program. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is performed by our highly skilled team of cardiothoracic surgeons. Khaled F.

Wide Awake Hand Surgery Becoming More Common Limb Salvage & Restoration Center 212-263-4325 Certain medical conditions, including , venous disease, and , can lead to serious conditions that affect the limbs, particularly the legs and feet. When this happens, highly specialized medical and surgical care is often needed to avoid amputation and preserve quality of life. At NYU Langone’s Limb Salvage and Restoration Center, our specialists use advanced techniques to restore healthy blood flow, promote healing, and prevent limb loss. This includes minimally invasive and surgical approaches to improve circulation and blood flow to the affected limb. We also provide the newest wound-healing treatments and offer clinical trials for promising therapies. Your treatment is coordinated by a team that includes experts in vascular surgery, wound care, podiatry, , infectious diseases, and rehabilitation. Our goal is to provide you with coordinated care that is focused on healing the source of illness and preventing limb loss whenever possible. If after considering all other treatment options, amputation is required, we use surgical techniques to preserve limb function and achieve the best possible performance with prosthetic devices. Arterial Treatment For people with peripheral arterial disease, our vascular surgeons use minimally invasive surgical techniques to remove blockages affecting blood flow to the limbs. This includes atherectomy to remove plaque that is blocking an artery, and balloon angioplasty and stenting to open a narrowed or clogged artery. Our vascular surgeons also perform arterial bypass to reroute blood around the blockage. In some cases, treatment involves a combination of these techniques. Vein Treatment When blood flow back to the heart is blocked due to chronic venous insufficiency , blood can start to pool in the legs. This can cause blood clots, pain, itching, and leg sores. Treatment may involve a combination of procedures to eliminate venous reflux caused by leaky valves that allow blood to flow in both directions, and procedures to open blocked deep veins. This includes heat-based therapies, such as laser and radiofrequency, as well as nonthermal therapies, such as special glue or foam, to treat problematic surface veins. It also includes treatments to remove blood clots, and balloon angioplasty and stenting to open blocked deep veins. Wound Healing We work with experts from the to provide comprehensive and advanced wound care. This includes advanced dermal products that help close wounds; total contact casting, which encases the wound and keeps weight off the foot as it heals; hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which delivers concentrated oxygen to the wound; and plastic surgery reconstruction to remove diseased bone or tissue. Foot Care Our podiatrists are experts in the medical and surgical management of the foot. We provide debridement to remove diseased tissue and help foot ulcers heal. When amputation is needed, we first aim to restore health to as much tissue as possible to limit the scope of the surgery. Limb Restoration Techniques When amputation is the best treatment option, our surgical team uses advanced techniques to preserve as much of the limb as possible. Working with our prosthetics experts, we develop a surgical plan that preserves nerve function and restores function with the use of the most technologically advanced prosthetic devices.

Here are some of those who may benefit: people with type 1 diabetes who need a or who have already received a kidney transplant people with type 1 diabetes who also experience hypoglycemic unawareness—very low blood sugar levels with no physical symptoms until they lose consciousness people with who have a low total daily insulin requirement Benefits of a Pancreas Transplant A successful pancreas transplant leaves patients insulin independent and eliminates the need to follow diabetic dietary restrictions or regularly check blood sugars. Some pancreas transplant recipients experience fewer, less-severe episodes of diabetes symptoms, such as numbness in their feet and hands. Support the Pancreas Transplant Program Make a monetary donation to our lifesaving pancreas transplant program. Pancreas Transplants We Offer Doctors at the NYU Langone Transplant Institute offer three options for pancreas transplant. Your transplant team helps you to decide which is the best for you. Simultaneous Kidney–Pancreas Transplant In a simultaneous kidney–pancreas transplant, often referred to as an SPK, a person receives a kidney and a pancreas transplant at the same time, with organs from a deceased donor. Pancreas After Kidney Transplant In a pancreas after kidney transplant, or PAK, a person receives a kidney transplant from a living donor and then, after several months of recovery, has a second surgery to receive a pancreas transplant from a deceased donor. Pancreas Transplant Alone People who have type 1 diabetes without kidney disease who experience life-threatening episodes of hypoglycemic unawareness may be candidates for a pancreas transplant alone, or PTA. Pancreas Transplant Evaluation You may be referred to the Transplant Institute by your endocrinologist or nephrologist, or you may contact us yourself. During your first visit, our team evaluates you to determine whether a pancreas or kidney–pancreas transplant is appropriate. During this medical visit, you meet with several members of the transplant team, including a nephrologist, social worker, nutritionist, and nurse coordinator. These experts guide you through the evaluation. You also meet the transplant surgeon, who explains the operation in detail. You complete blood and urine tests, a chest X-ray, a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, and specialized heart testing. Additionally, we require all transplant candidates to have age-appropriate cancer screenings, such as colonoscopy If our experts decide that you are a good candidate for a pancreas or kidney–pancreas transplant, we help you through the process. For people with end-stage kidney disease who have a potential living kidney donor, we facilitate evaluation of your donor and perform the living donor kidney transplant. You are also placed on the waiting list for a pancreas transplant. Once you recover from surgery, you are able to have a pancreas transplant from a deceased donor when an organ becomes available. If you do not have a kidney from a living donor, we add you to the kidney and pancreas transplant waitlist until a matching kidney and pancreas from the same deceased donor are available. In the months following a pancreas transplant, you have regular checkups with experts at the Transplant Institute.

Platelet-Rich Plasma Injections At NYU Langone’s Center for Regenerative Orthopedic Medicine, we offer the most advanced evidence-based biologics and other innovative therapies as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for musculoskeletal conditions and injuries. Biologics are nonsurgical therapies often derived from blood, proteins, and other substances that occur naturally in the body. Biologic therapies stimulate the body to heal, regrow tissue, and reduce inflammation. This may lead to less pain, accelerated healing, and a quicker return to activities you enjoy. NYU Langone’s excellence in regenerative orthopedic medicine stems from our early and ongoing research investigating the safest and most effective treatments for patients. Our experts work to exceed rigorous quality and safety standards set by the state and federal government. Backed by the technology, expertise, and resources of a world-class academic medical center, our team offers the most effective regenerative therapies as part of a total treatment plan for many musculoskeletal conditions, including the following: Achilles tendon injury ankle cartilage lesions bursitis and tendinitis elbow sprains and strains , including tennis and golfer’s elbow hip labral tears knee articular cartilage injuries meniscus tears osteoarthritis of the ankle, hip shoulder labral tears tendinopathies of the ankle, including those of the posterior tibial tendon and the peroneal tendon rotator cuff tears Platelet-rich plasma, stem cells, and hyaluronic acid—used separately or with other treatments—are the most common biologics we use in orthopedic care. We also offer innovative nonbiologic therapies to help speed healing, repair damaged tissues, and improve recovery after surgery. We take a personalized approach to every patient we treat, tailoring treatments to their specific condition. Platelet-Rich Plasma , or PRP, is a solution containing concentrated amounts of platelets, the cell fragments in blood that cause clotting. Platelets also stimulate healing by releasing substances called growth factors. When platelet-rich plasma is injected directly into tissue or an injured joint, it may speed healing. Stem Cells are a special type of cell that can, under the right conditions, develop into other types of cell in the body, such as muscle, bone, or cartilage. When a serum containing concentrated amounts of stems cells is injected into diseased or damaged tissue, it reduces inflammation and may encourage tissue to heal and regrow. Hyaluronic Acid Healthy joints contain a thick liquid called synovial fluid, which keeps them lubricated and moving freely without pain. Hyaluronic acid is an important component of synovial fluid, giving it a thick consistency. When hyaluronic acid breaks down, which is a normal part of aging, the synovial fluid thins and is less able to effectively lubricate the joints. Our experts use a hyaluronic acid solution, injecting it directly into the joint, to treat osteoarthritis of the ankle, knee, hip, and shoulder. The hyaluronic acid rethickens the synovial fluid and improves the joint’s gliding motion, usually for several months. Collagen Patches For some conditions that require surgery—such as a rotator cuff tear or Achilles tendon injury—our experts may place a small patch of collagen-based material on the damaged tissue during surgery. Collagen is a plentiful protein in the body and a major component of ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Because your body uses collagen to repair these tissues, the use of a collagen patch may encourage healing and lessen pain after surgery. Shock Wave Therapy Our experts also use shock wave therapy, a noninvasive and nonbiologic treatment that focuses high-energy sound waves on damaged tissue, which in turn speeds healing. Shock wave therapy is used for conditions such as shoulder labral tears, stress fractures in the foot, and tendon problems in the ankle. Regenerative Orthopedic Medicine Research Our experts conduct research studies investigating innovative regenerative medicine therapies. These emerging treatments may be available to you through participation in a clinical trial. Your doctor may discuss these opportunities with you. Doctors at the Center for Regenerative Orthopedic Medicine work with you to establish a comprehensive treatment plan that includes regenerative therapies for musculoskeletal conditions and injuries.

Cardiac electrophysiologist Dr. Larry A. Chinitz performs surgery. During your initial evaluation at the Heart Rhythm Center, our experienced team determines the impact of the , or abnormal heart rhythm, and whether treatment is needed. For some people with heart rhythm disorders, no treatment may be required. For others, medication and lifestyle changes can be effective. When necessary, catheter-based treatments or cardiac devices may be recommended. Treatments for Heart Rhythm Conditions We provide the following medical interventions to treat heart rhythm disorders. Catheter Ablation Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive way to eliminate a variety of arrhythmias. Doctors use a special catheter to deliver radiofrequency energy that can correct the abnormal heartbeat signals causing the arrhythmia without having to perform open heart surgery. For many people, this procedure cures an arrhythmia without requiring additional medication or surgery. A pacemaker is used to treat people who have a slow heart rate, known as . NYU Langone is one of the sites for an international clinical trial evaluating the next generation of leadless pacemakers, which eliminate the wires that can be associated with infections and other complications. Dr. Larry Chinitz , director of the Heart Rhythm Center, is the national principal investigator for the trial. Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Device The left atrial appendage occlusion device (LAAOD) reduces the risk of in people with by stopping blood clots from traveling out of the heart and to the brain. This treatment, which includes the WATCHMAN™ device and others undergoing clinical development, are recommended for patients who are unable to tolerate anticoagulation therapy. Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) sends an electric shock to convert serious , such as tachycardia and fibrillation, back to a normal, slower, and regular heartbeat. ICDs significantly reduce the risk of death in people with these types of ventricular arrhythmias. These devices are now available in models that are transvenous, or inserted through a vein, and subcutaneous, or placed under the skin. Medication and Lifestyle Management For some people, medication and lifestyle changes can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. You may be prescribed medications that lower blood pressure and reduce your risk of blood clots. We recommend a heart-healthy diet and regular exercise for all of our patients. We also have an active screening process to identify patients with obstructive sleep apnea , a cardiac risk factor. Follow-Up Care for Heart Rhythm Conditions For patients who receive a pacemaker or defibrillator, our device and arrhythmia monitoring center is staffed by clinicians who coordinate care between outpatient management and hospital-based procedures. Our team is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In rare cases, the leads that deliver electrical energy from a pacemaker or ICD to the heart need to be removed. The Heart Rhythm Center is a leader in lead extraction and management , and one of only four centers in the United States that perform extractions. At the Sports Performance Center at NYU Langone, we offer performance testing and programs to help you maximize your athletic ability, movement efficiency, and musculoskeletal conditioning while reducing the risk of injury. We also offer and special programs for Our performance testing programs provide our experts with the information they need to create your personalized fitness program. Resting Metabolic Rate The resting metabolic rate test determines the amount of energy, or calories, your body uses at rest. To determine this measurement, a plastic hood is placed safely on your head and face. This controlled environment allows us to analyze how much oxygen your body uses and how much carbon dioxide your body produces to determine caloric expenditure and energy substrate utilization in a resting state. We provide a review of your test results and recommendations based on your caloric needs. This service can also complement your treatment plan as part of NYU Langone’s Aerobic Capacity Test (VO2max) The aerobic capacity test (VO2max) measures aerobic capacity. It tells you the maximal rate at which your heart and lungs are able to provide oxygen to exercising muscles, and how much work your muscles are able to do while using that oxygen as the primary energy source. The aerobic capacity test is the leading indicator of aerobic fitness and health status. You’ll learn just how efficient you are at using energy supplies for a long run, ride, or swim. You’ll also discover which energy systems you need to work on to improve your performance. This test may be recommended as part of your treatment plan through NYU Langone’s Weight Management Program. Lactate Threshold Testing Lactate threshold testing is for the athlete looking to perfect his or her training. This test determines the point at which your body can no longer supply oxygen for energy. This leads to increased lactate production, the primary marker for fatigue onset.

Our heart valve doctors review your records, and at your appointment, we discuss your treatment options. During your visit, you may also meet with other specialists based on your individual needs such as geriatric cardiologists, physical therapists, nutritionists, or research specialists. We understand that deciding among the variety of treatment options for heart valve disease may feel overwhelming for patients and their families. We provide you and your family with the information you need to make an informed decision. Diagnostic Testing for Heart Valve Disease We offer multiple tests at the Heart Valve Center to diagnose aortic valve disease diagnose mitral valve disease . They include the following: echocardiogram, in which ultrasound is used to show how your heart and its valves are working cardiac catheterization, in which a long, thin, narrow tube is used to look for blockages in the arteries cardiac CT scan, in which X-ray imaging is used to view your heart and blood vessels electrocardiogram, known as an EKG, which analyzes your heart’s electrical activity Echocardiograms are performed at NYU Langone’s noninvasive cardiac imaging and testing team , which is led by Dr. Muhamed Saric , a world-renowned expert in this field. Treatments for Aortic Valve Disease includes aortic valve stenosis and aortic valve regurgitation .

Transcatheter techniques generally require a one-night hospital stay, while open heart procedures can require a two- to four-day hospital stay. Nonsurgical Treatment for Sports Medicine Injuries Whenever possible, our specialists use nonsurgical treatments for injuries and conditions such as , golfer’s elbow, , and shoulder dislocations. Dr. Guillem Gonzalez-Lomas and other sports medicine specialists offer surgical and nonsurgical treatments for injuries and conditions that affect the shoulder and arm. Our advanced nonsurgical techniques are performed on an outpatient basis and include injections using platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, stem cell therapy, and shock wave therapy. Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy In PRP therapy, your own blood components are used to stimulate healing in acute or chronically injured tendons, muscles, and ligaments. During the procedure, which takes between 20 and 30 minutes, our experts take a small amount of blood from your arm and place it in a special processing unit that separates the platelets and growth factors from the other blood components. The platelets and growth factors are then collected in a sterile syringe and injected into the targeted tissue. Stem Cell Therapy Adult mesenchymal stem cells, found in bone marrow, are primitive cells that help our bodies naturally heal. These cells have unique capabilities: They can differentiate into multiple tissues, including bone, cartilage, and muscle, as well as reduce inflammation. During a stem cell therapy procedure, which takes under 45 minutes, adult mesenchymal stem cells, derived from your own bone marrow, are removed from a bone in your pelvis, concentrated into a serum, and then injected into the injured knee, hip, or shoulder. It’s usually an outpatient procedure, often performed without the need for sedation. Shock wave therapy is used to stimulate healing in acute or chronically injured tendons and muscles. Our experts use Extracorporeal Pulse Technology , or EPAT —a unique set of pressure waves targeted at an area with chronic pain—to simulate cell production, enhance blood circulation, and eventually regenerate damaged tissue. The procedure usually takes 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the type of injury. Generally, five sessions are necessary for you to experience pain relief.

Stem Cell Treatments in Regenerative Orthopedic Medicine Specialists at NYU Langone’s use stem cell therapies as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for musculoskeletal injuries and conditions. Stem cells are a special type of cell. Some types, given the right conditions, can develop into different types of cells, such as muscle, bone, cartilage, blood, or nerve cells. Evidence suggests that for some conditions, injecting stem cells into the damaged tissue reduces inflammation and pain, improves function, and may help the tissue to heal and regrow. Stem cells can also interact with other blood cells to stimulate the immune system and act as powerful anti-inflammatory agents. Adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells At NYU Langone, we use adult mesenchymal stem cells, which are retrieved from bone marrow or fat tissue, and then concentrated into a solution that is injected directly into damaged tissue. Our experts use these stem cell injections to help treat orthopedic conditions, including the following: damage to, or fracture of the cartilage of the ankle, knee, or elbow; also called osteochondral injuries During a stem cell therapy procedure, your doctor may retrieve stem cells from fat tissue, also called adipose tissue, or your own bone marrow. To take stem cells from your bone marrow, the doctor thoroughly numbs an area at your pelvic bone and then uses a syringe to extract bone marrow fluid, also known as bone marrow aspirate. The solution is concentrated into a serum that is injected directly in the affected tissue. Fat tissue is also an abundant supply of stem cells and other factors. Your doctor removes fat tissue from your abdomen after numbing the area or while you are under anesthesia. The stem cells are separated from the fat and then injected into the affected joint or tissue. After stem cell therapy, your doctor may recommend that you avoid taking anti-inflammatory medications for up to several weeks. Your doctor may also advise you to limit activity while the injury heals. Depending on your condition or injury, you may experience improved function and pain relief within six weeks. You doctor will explain what to expect after treatment. Financial Assistance for Dancers provides medical care to injured dancers who may not otherwise be able to pay for treatment.

A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a mechanical device that is surgically implanted in the body to help a heart that has been weakened by or cardiogenic shock to pump blood through the body. It is designed for people with advanced heart failure who are currently awaiting a or those who are not transplant candidates. Video: Making Heart Failure a Manageable Condition , our team offers commercially available long-term devices. In recent years, LVADs have become smaller, quieter, and more portable, significantly improving the quality of life for patients. Your cardiac specialist performs an extensive medical evaluation to determine your eligibility for an LVAD . Prior to surgery, our experts explain the details of LVAD surgery and provide information on your recovery and rehabilitation plan. Our heart failure surgeons are specially trained and certified to implant LVADs. The devices are implanted and connected to the left ventricle, or bottom left heart chamber, and the aorta, the main artery leaving the heart. A cable that powers the pump exits the body through the abdomen and connects to a controller and battery packs, which are recharged nightly. When the surgery is complete, the LVAD takes over the pumping function of the left side of the heart, working in tandem with the right side of the heart to pump blood through your body. Recovering from LVAD Surgery The procedure to implant an LVAD takes place at in Manhattan or in Mineola. After surgery, your recovery begins in the intensive care unit, where our cardiac experts monitor your health. As you regain strength, you may begin with rehabilitation experts from NYU Langone’s . Your hospital stay may last from two to four weeks. Doctors from NYU Langone’s carefully evaluate people who have symptoms of advanced to determine if they are candidates for this lifesaving, heart-assisting device. Heart failure symptoms can include severe fatigue, shortness of breath with limited activity, and a frequent buildup of fluid in the body that has led to repeated hospitalizations. For people with advanced heart failure who are awaiting a , an LVAD may be surgically implanted and remain in place for several years until a donor heart becomes available. For people who are not candidates for a heart transplant, an LVAD can be permanently implanted, with the goal of extending a person’s life as well as improving quality of life. Reasons for ineligibility for a heart transplant can include other major health issues that may interfere with the success of a transplant. An LVAD may not be recommended for people with major brain injuries, serious infections, severe kidney failure, or other life-threatening conditions. Platelet-Rich Plasma Injections in Regenerative Orthopedic Medicine use platelet-rich plasma alone or in combination with other treatments to help musculoskeletal injuries and conditions heal more quickly and reduce pain and inflammation. Platelets, along with red blood cells and white blood cells, are one of the solid components of blood. These sticky cell fragments cause blood to clot; growth factors, found in platelets, play an important part in how the body heals itself. Plasma is the liquid part of blood. It is mostly water, but also contains proteins and other nutrients. Platelet-rich plasma, or PRP, is made by combining a concentrated solution of platelets with plasma, which your doctor injects directly into the damaged tissue. There is evidence suggesting platelet-rich plasma can improve function and reduce pain in people with the following acute or chronic conditions: damage to, or fracture of, the cartilage of the ankle, knee, or elbow; also called osteochondral injuries Platelet-Rich Plasma Treatment To receive platelet-rich plasma, your doctor takes a small amount of your blood from a vein in your arm and then uses a device called a centrifuge to separate the platelets and growth factors from other parts of the blood. This solution is placed in a syringe, and your doctor injects it directly into the affected tissue, using ultrasound guidance if necessary for precision and accuracy. This is an in-office procedure and usually takes no more than 30 minutes. After the treatment, you may experience soreness at the injection site for a few days. Your doctor may advise you to avoid anti-inflammatory medications for up to several weeks after the procedure. This is because the platelet-rich plasma injection stimulates the body’s inflammatory response, a key part of healing that these medications could block. After a platelet-rich plasma injection, your doctor may also advise you to limit or avoid activity for up to six weeks, depending on the injury or condition, to allow it to heal. How soon you experience relief, and how long that relief lasts, depends on several factors, including the severity of your injury or condition. Your doctor will explain what you can expect. At NYU Langone’s Joint Preservation and Arthritis Center, the Joint Preservation Registry aims to advance personalized medicine in orthopedic and musculoskeletal care. Currently focusing on cartilage damage and osteoarthritis of the knee , the registry captures and combines clinical, biomarker, and outcome data over a five-year period to improve the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The goal is to identify patients who may benefit from joint-preserving procedures, and those who may consider total joint replacement as a treatment option. Rheumatologist Dr. Jonathan Samuels examines a patient. All patients of who have knee complaints are encouraged to enroll. As an observational study, participation does not require any changes to standard procedures. Study participants are not required to come in for extra visits, nor are they turned away from coming into the clinic as part of a study exercise. Patients continue to participate in their own treatment decisions, and can rest assured that time with their physician is not disrupted. Participants are asked to answer a brief survey via email once a year. The survey asks about at-home treatments used for their condition, the development of new complaints, and the long-term outcome of their condition. All patient data is de-identified to protect the confidentiality of all study participants. As part of the registry, our researchers are analyzing: the effectiveness of alternative, nonsurgical treatments the relationship between individual patient characteristics and the response to particular treatment alternatives, as captured by patient-reported outcome scores the potential for using biomarkers to make treatment decisions for an individual patient the use of advanced radiologic imaging and high-strength MRI units to characterize joint damage Patients interested in participating in the Joint Preservation Registry should discuss participation with their NYU Langone physician.

Depending on your particular condition, we may recommend oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, or topical anti-inflammatory gels and creams. Corticosteroid, or cortisone, is a type of medication that greatly reduces inflammation and can be used to manage a variety of acute and chronic conditions. We perform injections with imaging, such as ultrasound or fluoroscopic guided techniques. Other options include injecting hyaluronic acid—the substance that cushions and lubricates joints—directly into the joint to help ease pain; platelet rich plasma therapy, which involves using a component of a patient’s own blood to heal damaged parts of the joint; stem cell therapy that delivers a patient’s own stem cells into arthritic or injured joints to provide long-lasting relief from pain; and physical therapy. Alternative therapies are also available, such as acupuncture and Active Release Techniques (ART). Surgical Treatments If you require surgery, we offer a number of advanced options. These include surgical microfracture, in which tiny holes created in the bone introduce fresh blood and bone marrow to the site of an injury; procedures that transfer healthy cartilage to the site of a damaged or injured joint; meniscus repair and transplantation; a range of surgeries to realign or repair damage to the hip or knee; and total or partial joint replacement when the time is right.

Jeremiah Levine, MD Pediatric Gastroenterology David B. Snell, MD Treatment at the Peripheral Nerve Center At NYU Langone’s Peripheral Nerve Center, our surgeons have access to advanced technology and use the most current surgical techniques. Our goal is to help you overcome injury and illness and improve your quality of life. Peripheral Nerve Conditions We Treat We provide treatment for many nerve conditions, including greater occipital nerve entrapment, hereditary predisposition to pressure palsies, neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, pronator syndrome, radial tunnel syndrome, superficial sensory radial nerve entrapment, supinator syndrome, suprascapular nerve entrapment, and ulnar nerve compression at the elbow or the wrist. We also have one of the few advanced programs for the minimally invasive surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis, which is a condition that causes excessive sweating in the palms and soles of the feet that can interfere with patients’ quality of life. Dr. Noel Perin heads the program and specializes in endoscopic minimally invasive surgery. For certain patients, the surgery can greatly improve quality of life. Specialists at the Peripheral Nerve Center also treat people who have , double crush syndrome, meralgia paresthetica, Morton's neuroma, neurogenic pyriformis syndrome, peroneal nerve entrapment at the fibular head, and pudendal nerve entrapment. In addition, our doctors care for people with nerve injuries, including brachial plexus injuries, inguinal neuralgia, obturator nerve injury and entrapment, painful neuromas, peroneal nerve injury and foot drop, radial nerve injury, scapular winging, and spinal accessory nerve injury. We also offer treatment for peripheral nerve tumors, including lipomas involving nerves, malignant nerve sheath tumors and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, metastatic and infiltrative tumors involving nerves, , plexiform neurofibromas, radiation plexitis, schwannoma, schwannomatosis, solitary neurofibromas, and synovial cyst. Peripheral Nerve Procedures When nerves have been cut or torn, our surgeons perform nerve repair surgery to reattach the nerve ends. If the damaged nerves are not long enough to stitch together, we perform a nerve graft from the leg or a nerve transplant using a donor. If a nerve graft is not feasible, we perform conduit nerve repair in which small, absorbable tubes, called conduits, are used to connect and protect the nerves. When a nerve is pulled from the spinal cord, such as when a person has a brachial plexus injury that affects the shoulder and arm, we perform either nerve transfer, using a nerve from another part of the body to restore movement, or end-to-side repair, which works to repair a partially functioning nerve. We also perform contralateral C7 transfer, using the nerve root from the seventh bone in the cervical spine from the unaffected side of the body to repair the injured brachial plexus. For severe brachial plexus injuries, muscle and tendon transfers may be considered. We also perform a procedure called neurolysis, either external or internal, to remove scar tissue that could trap nerves. Surgical Technology Our neurosurgeons use the latest in diagnostic and surgical technology to ensure your safety. Intraoperative Electrophysiological Monitoring in Peripheral Nerve Surgery When the affected nerve is exposed during surgery, very sensitive electrical testing can be performed. This testing, which is not possible through the skin before the surgery, helps guide the surgeon. This testing also helps surgeons determine whether a nerve should be replaced with a graft or if it has the potential to heal if surrounding scar tissue is removed. Other available intraoperative electrical tests can be used to monitor nerve function during tumor removal and to determine whether spinal rootlets, which connect nerve roots to the spinal cord, are intact during brachial plexus surgery. Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for Peripheral Nerve Disorders For severe nerve damage that does not respond to more conservative treatment, direct peripheral nerve stimulation may provide pain relief. This method works much like a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation unit, also known as TENS, but connects directly to the nerve, not the skin. Peripheral nerve stimulation can ease pain associated with supraorbital neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, and inguinal neuralgia. We also can provide tibial nerve stimulation for people who have had unsuccessful Morton's neuroma surgery. An electrode is placed on the nerve for a short trial period. If it helps, a small programmable pacemaker is placed under the skin. The unit can then deliver pain relief as needed and be switched off when the pain subsides. Psoriatic Arthritis Center 646-501-7400 645-754-9607 Some people with go on to develop , a condition that leads to itchy, sore patches on the skin in addition to joint pain. Treatment requires a coordinated effort by dermatologists and rheumatologists to help manage symptoms such as swelling, inflammation, and skin changes. At NYU Langone’s Psoriatic Arthritis Center, we treat more than 1,300 people each year, giving them access to traditional and newer medications. Our physicians and scientists are leading extensive research into providing the best care for patients with psoriatic arthritis, as well as studying the early events that may lead to developing the condition for insight into its origins. The center’s dermatologists, rheumatologists, and scientists use these discoveries to develop novel approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of psoriatic arthritis. Dr. Jill P. Buyon and Dr. Jose U. Scher We are also building upon recent discoveries made at NYU Langone regarding the microbiome, which are the microbes that live in and on the human body, and new-onset rheumatoid arthritis. We are using these observations to shed light on the potential microbial triggers of psoriatic arthritis. Our rheumatologists help provide relief for patients with psoriatic arthritis. The Psoriatic Arthritis Center is involved in numerous clinical trials that evaluate treatments for the condition. We work with NYU Langone’s Seligman Center for Advanced Therapeutics as well as the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research Registry, which tracks participants to answer important questions regarding psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Our rheumatologists are experts at treating patients with psoriatic arthritis. Rebecca Haberman Andrea L. Neimann Dermatologist Jose U. Scher Psoriatic Arthritis Rheumatologist Gary E.

Study Helps Explain What Drives Psoriasis Severity & Spread At NYU Langone’s Latino Liver Program—part of the —we provide the most medically advanced and culturally conscious care to Hispanic and Latino children and adults who need or may need a liver transplant or liver surgery. By removing a potential language barrier, our bilingual hepatologists, transplant surgeons, and nurse practitioners help you and your family more easily understand and navigate the transplant or liver surgery process and receive the support you need before, during, and after surgery. In addition to being comfortable communicating in Spanish, the transplant hepatologists, surgeons, infectious disease specialists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, and nurse practitioners, general cardiologists, and heart failure specialists who make up our multidisciplinary team also understand the many cultural nuances within the larger Latino community. Liver transplant care for children is provided through the Pediatric Liver Disease and Transplant Program Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone Health . Our surgeons offer whole liver transplant, from a deceased donor; split liver transplant, in which the liver from a deceased donor is divided in two, providing organs for two different patients; and living donor transplant , in which a person donates a portion of their liver to the patient. Addressing a Growing Need In the United States, the rate of chronic liver disease among people of Hispanic and Latino ethnicity is twice that of the non-Hispanic White population. Currently, Hispanic and Latino people make up roughly 20 percent of both the national liver transplant waitlist and of liver transplant recipients. Significant disparities in access to liver transplantation exists for these groups in the form of lower referral rates to liver transplant centers, lower rates of placement on the liver transplant waitlist, higher waitlist removal rates, and lower liver transplant rates. Our goal is to help address these disparities. To learn more about NYU Langone’s Latino Liver Program, call 212-263-8133.

View All Locations (24) A CT scan, also known as a computerized tomogram or CAT scan, is a noninvasive type of X-ray that helps doctors diagnose medical conditions that may not be visible on other types of imaging technology. Using a CT scan allows radiologists from NYU Langone ’s the ability to see more than what a regular can provide. NYU Langone radiologists review and interpret CT scans to diagnose a variety of illnesses, including abdominal, cardiac, musculoskeletal, neurological, spine-related, and thoracic conditions. A CT scanner is a doughnut-shaped machine that uses advanced X-ray technology to take pictures of your body. A computer in the scanner reconstructs the data into cross-sectional pictures of your body, called slices or sections. Unlike an MRI, a CT scanner is an open machine—you are not enclosed and can see completely around yourself. NYU Langone offers patients the most advanced CT scanner technology available, providing images of exceptional quality, while using the lowest possible radiation dose to keep you safe. Learn more about Why Doctors Order a CT Scan CT scans enable doctors to see cross-sectional images of your internal organs. CT scans can potentially help your doctor see the cause of your symptoms, diagnose certain diseases, and evaluate treatment response. Critical information can be provided to your doctor, often more quickly and economically compared with other tests. Compared to MRI, CT provides a better evaluation of certain elements such as air, blood, and calcifications. This means that air-containing structures such as the lungs are better studied using CT. Preparing for a CT Scan You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for up to three hours before your CT scan, especially if a contrast material is going to be used in your exam. You should inform your doctor of any medications that you are taking and if you have any allergies. You can take your medications before the CT scan. Talk with your doctor before the CT scan for any specific instructions. Also, please inform your doctor of any recent illnesses or other medical conditions, such as a history of heart disease, asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, or thyroid problems. When you schedule your appointment, our scheduling associate tells you how early to arrive. Depending on the type of exam, it may be 30 to 60 minutes before your scheduled appointment. This allows time for registration and to complete all necessary paperwork, forms, and questionnaires. Be sure to bring your prescription, insurance card, and any related insurance forms or precertifications. If you require a precertification for the study and you do not bring it with you, you will likely be delayed until it is on file in our department. It may be helpful to confirm that the doctor referring you for the exam has secured the precertification and has faxed it to our department. You should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to your exam. Certain exams may require you to wear a gown, which is provided. We have private dressing rooms with lockers for your clothes and valuables, although we suggest that you leave your valuables at home. Metal objects including jewelry, eyeglasses, dentures, and hairpins may affect the CT images and should be left at home or removed prior to your exam. You may also be asked to take out hearing aids and removable dental work. Some abdominal CT scans require the administration of water or oral contrast material to allow the radiologist to evaluate your bowel and also to separate the bowel from other important organs and tissues. If you are having a CT scan of your abdomen or pelvis, you need to arrive one hour before your appointment. You will be asked to drink some type of oral contrast agent; either dilute or very dilute barium, dilute iodine, or water. During this period of time, you can fill out your forms and other paperwork. Your physician and radiologist may determine that intravenous (IV) contrast material is needed for your CT scan. IV contrast material containing iodine is used to highlight organs and blood vessels that are otherwise difficult to visualize. If required, a small IV is placed in your arm or hand prior to the CT scan. IV contrast material is safe for most patients, but there is a small chance of a reaction in a very small percentage of patients.  Before your scan, one of our staff members asks you a few questions to assess your risk of reaction. Allergic reactions can occur following IV contrast administration. The likelihood for an allergic reaction is increased if you have a history of active uncontrolled asthma, if you’ve had a prior allergic reaction to contrast, or if you have a history of a life-threatening reaction to any allergen or medication. Please notify your referring physician prior to scheduling your CT scan appointment if you have any of these risk factors or a known allergy to contrast material. Your doctor may prescribe medications to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. During a CT Scan Our CT technologist takes you into the CT scanner room and positions you on the table, which moves into the doughnut-shaped portion of the scanner. At this point, the CT technologist exits the room. You and the technologist are able to speak with each other through an intercom system. The technologist lets you know when the pictures are going to be taken—during this time you need to hold still, as moving causes the images to be blurry. The technologist gives you specific breathing instructions; for example, you may be asked to hold your breath or to breathe quietly. As the scanner takes the pictures, the table slides through the scanner and then back out. The exam length depends on the type of scan that has been ordered for you. Most people are on the scanning table for less than 10 minutes. A technologist communicates with you throughout the exam and lets you know if additional images need to be taken. After a CT Scan When your scan is completed, you may resume your regular diet and activities. We recommend that you drink plenty of non-alcoholic, decaffeinated fluids, such as water or juice, to help your body flush out any IV or oral contrast material. After your CT scan, our radiologists read the images and dictate a report that is sent to your doctor, who contacts you with the results.

Our deep brain stimulation (DBS) program is one of the country’s most active—we perform more than 100 procedures each year. Conditions we use DBS to manage include Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, , and severe . DBS has also been used as an experimental treatment for other neurological disorders such as Huntington’s disease and High Intensity Focused Ultrasound For people who have essential tremor or Parkinson’s disease with severe tremor, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive approach that counters abnormal brain signals associated with the condition. HIFU works by sending a focused ultrasound beam from an external transmitter into the brain to destroy the neural tissue that is causing the unwanted motor symptoms. VIDEO: Under the care of Dr. Alon Mogilner at the Center for Neuromodulation, Vincent receives high intensity focused ultrasound to successfully treat his tremors. To confirm that symptoms can be reduced without unwanted side effects, our doctors precisely map the brain area, and then apply test doses to produce a temporary lesion. Once the target is confirmed, multiple 30-second treatment doses of HIFU are given while you are inside an MRI machine. This outpatient procedure takes just a few hours to complete. Following the procedure, symptoms improve immediately, and you can return to your normal activities. NYU Langone’s Center for Neuromodulation is one of only two facilities in New York state that offer this procedure. Spinal Cord Stimulation Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical procedure used to manage chronic pain in the arms, legs, and back that may result from many conditions, including complex regional pain syndrome and . Electrodes are placed over the lining of the spinal cord, known as the dura, to deliver stimulation. SCS is performed in two separate stages: a trial procedure, followed by a permanent implant if the trial is successful. Each stage takes between one and two hours, and the vast majority of these surgeries are done as an outpatient. Stage one involves implanting trial electrodes, via small needles, which are then connected to an external battery and programmer. We ask you to try the stimulation at home for a week and assess its ability to provide pain relief. The electrodes are easily removed in the office approximately one week later. If the trial demonstrates a significant improvement in your pain, permanent implantation can take place during a short surgical procedure. The trial electrodes are removed and permanent ones are put in place and connected to a pacemaker-like device that is implanted under your skin. After the procedure, you are taught to use the device to control pain as needed. Adjustments to the strength and location of stimulation can be easily made via a handheld remote control. Peripheral Neurostimulation Peripheral neurostimulation (PNS) is a surgical procedure used to treat patients with chronic headaches or facial pain. Electrodes are placed under the skin of the scalp or area of the face where the pain is occurring and then connected to a pacemaker-like device that is also implanted beneath the skin. Electrical stimulation is applied to the affected area, which multiple studies have proven to be highly effective in decreasing the severity and frequency of headache or facial pain The outpatient PNS procedure is performed in two separate hour-long stages. The first stage uses trial electrodes, with a number of stimulation programs administered over the next few days. If this trial demonstrates a significant improvement in your headache or facial pain, permanent implantation can take place. In stage two, a permanent set of electrodes are implanted and then connected to a small pacemaker-like device that is inserted under the skin in the chest, abdomen, or back. The specific device used is tailored to each person’s needs. After implantation, we teach you how to use the device to control pain as needed. Adjustments to the strength and location of stimulation can be easily made via a handheld remote control. Intrathecal Pump Placement In patients with debilitating spasticity, such as children with cerebral palsy or adults after , as well as people with or spinal cord injury, a small catheter can be placed into the spinal fluid and connected to a medication pump under the skin. This pump delivers highly potent baclofen, a medication that helps relax muscles and stop cramping. We have doctors located throughout Manhattan. When you are diagnosed with a tumor in your sinuses, nose, pituitary gland, or the frontal lobes of your brain, we understand that you may feel overwhelmed. The idea of having surgery in this delicate area that is home to nerves related to balance, facial movement, hearing, and sight can cause many people to feel anxious or worried. Rest assured that the medical team at NYU Langone’s Anterior Skull Base Surgery Center has the experience and skill to provide you with the best treatment for your condition. Dr. Chandra Sen Dr. Richard Lebowitz , who have a combined 40 years of experience focused specifically on using anterior skull base surgery to remove tumors such as meningiomas , craniopharyngioma, juvenile angiofibromas, chordomas, and esthesioneuroblastomas. We also treat patients with non-tumorous conditions, such as cerebrospinal fluid fistulas and mucoceles. In all, we perform more than 100 such procedures each year. Otolaryngologist Dr. Richard Lebowitz analyzes scans on his computer. The Anterior Skull Base Surgery Center team includes neurosurgeons as well as otolaryngologists, also known as ear, nose, and throat specialists, who are experienced in both open craniotomy and endoscopic endonasal surgery. The craniotomy approach requires opening the skull to perform surgery, a procedure that creates visible incisions and generally requires a longer hospital stay and recovery time. Many patients qualify for a less invasive approach: endonasal endoscopy. Instead of opening the skull to access the tumor, a tiny camera attached to a long, thin, lighted tube is inserted into the nasal and sinus cavity, so it can relay images of the tumor site to a television screen. The neurosurgeon inserts small tools through the nasal cavity and removes the tumor using those images as a guide. The minimally invasive endoscopic approach means that, unlike open craniotomy surgery, there is no visible scarring, and many patients are back to work within two to six weeks. Our neurosurgeons and cancer experts treat patients with malignant and benign tumors that occur in the delicate area at the base of the brain. Learn More About Skull Base Tumors For tumors that require radiation therapy, we use Leksell Gamma Knife Icon™ radiosurgery , which allows us to deliver targeted, precise doses of radiation therapy to a brain tumor.

New Section Chief of Pancreas Surgery Named One Split Liver Transplant Saves a Toddler & a 63-Year-Old Become a Living Liver Donor Support the Living Liver Donor Program Make a monetary donation to support our living liver donor program. The number of people added to the national liver transplant waiting list grows each year. But the number of available livers from deceased donors stays about the same. As a result, people who need lifesaving liver transplant surgery to treat cirrhosis, liver failure, , and other conditions often face long wait times. , our doctors perform living donor transplants to treat many kinds of liver disease. This approach creates shorter wait times and improved health for liver recipients. Organ Donation by Living Liver Donors For a living donor transplant, donors provide part of their healthy liver—up to 70 percent—to a recipient. The livers of both the donor and recipient regrow to full size approximately three months after the surgery. There is no financial or medical benefit to donating a part of your liver, but helping another person live can be rewarding. We conduct an extensive evaluation process to minimize the risks to the donor, ensuring safety above everything else. Any healthy individual can be a donor, not just immediate family members. Nondirected donation involves donating to a stranger. Another option is paired exchange, in which living liver donor and recipient pairs collaborate to find compatible livers for each recipient. Benefits of Living Liver Donation Some patients, such as those with liver cancer or certain blood types, may benefit more from a living donor liver transplant than they would from a transplant that came from a deceased donor. In addition, when an organ is received from a deceased liver donor, surgery must occur on a rapid timeline. Living donation allows the liver recipient to prepare for surgery. The surgical date can be planned around your schedule, as well as the schedule of your medical team and the recipient. Doctors can also schedule surgery at a time when the recipient is doing well medically. The healthier the recipient is before transplant, the better the outcome usually is. The goal is to perform liver transplant early in the disease process, before other organs and systems are affected. This allows for a safer procedure, speeds the recovery process, and improves surgical outcomes. Living Liver Donor Consultation All prospective donors complete a series of medical examinations and interviews with our staff to determine whether they are appropriate candidates for living liver donation. The consultation may include the following: blood tests to check for a compatible blood type and conditions such as fatty liver disease or , which exclude candidates from donating , such as X-rays and MRI or CT scans to ensure the liver has a portion large enough to donate and has a good blood supply an evaluation from a cardiologist that includes an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check the electrical activity of the heart and an echocardiogram, an imaging test to assess the heart valves and pumping action pulmonary function tests to check lung health a meeting with a social worker or psychologist to ensure the donor understands and is prepared for the process a discussion with a transplant surgeon and hepatologist about the procedure and recovery a meeting with an independent living donor advocate, who ensures that the liver donor’s interests are represented When the living liver donor evaluation is complete, our transplant team meets with the prospective donor to discuss test results and candidacy. If the team agrees, the surgery is scheduled based around the donor’s and recipient’s schedules. What to Expect from Living Donor Surgery NYU Langone surgeons are experts at performing living liver donor surgery. This procedure consists of a partial hepatectomy—the surgical removal of a portion of the liver. During liver donor transplantation, your doctor makes an incision across the abdomen to carefully remove a part of the liver, along with the gallbladder. The donor surgery takes about six to eight hours. The transplant team will stop the procedure if they think your liver is not suitable for the recipient. After the surgery, you recover in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) overnight and then are transferred to a regular hospital recovery room for about five days. After returning home, you continue to see your NYU Langone doctors for regular follow-up appointments to ensure you are healing well. Most people are able to go back to their daily activities six to eight weeks after the procedure. If you are interested in becoming a living liver donor, you can complete a confidential health screening for liver donations to begin the process. To learn more about liver donation or to speak with a liver donor team specialist, call and then select option 4, or email LivingLiverDonorTeam@NYULangone.org Leksell Gamma Knife Icon™ radiosurgery, available at NYU Langone’s Center for Advanced Radiosurgery, is the most established form of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), a dedicated and minimally invasive method of treatment for brain tumors, blood vessel malformations, and other brain disorders. It requires no surgical incision in order to reach the target area. Gamma Knife is used on lesions and abnormalities in the brain. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is unlike any other form of SRS because it is used exclusively for the brain. Surgeons use MRI or other high-resolution brain imaging to create a three-dimensional picture of the targeted part of the brain. The Gamma Knife then delivers small beams of radiation that concentrate within the target. The radiation is delivered with a high degree of precision. Radiation oncologist Dr. Joshua Silverman and neurosurgeon Dr. Douglas Kondziolka review images. The Gamma Knife has no moving parts for radiation delivery, which reduces the margin for mechanical error. The Gamma Knife Icon The Gamma Knife Icon™ is the newest, most sophisticated version of SRS, both for the device and the software that powers radiation dose planning. The Icon™ system features advanced patient treatment and safety features, including a newly remastered, more flexible dose delivery system that allows physicians to administer doses to one or more targets in the brain while the patient is in the same treatment position. The team at the Center for Advanced Radiosurgery can provide noninvasive treatment to multiple brain lesions simultaneously in a single procedure. Patient Benefits: Safety and Effectiveness The Gamma Knife allows surgeons to perform brain surgery without opening the skull, and the affected tissue can be targeted with extreme precision, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues. Because a surgical incision is not required, the risks associated with open brain surgery, including acute hemorrhage, spinal fluid leakage and infection, are reduced. Patients typically receive sedation and are able to communicate during treatment as well, thereby eliminating the risks associated with general anesthesia. As a result, patients who undergo Gamma Knife radiosurgery are less likely to experience complications that with conventional open brain surgery, and tend to report back with positive outcomes. The procedure usually does not require an overnight stay, and the majority of patients are discharged home the same morning. While patients must come in early to register at the hospital, most are finished in time for lunch, and although individual patient outcomes may vary, patients can often resume their normal activities the day after treatment. In contrast, conventional open brain surgery typically requires hospitalization for several days or longer. By avoiding this hospital stay, radiosurgery also helps reduce the cost of treatment. Are There Alternative Treatment Options? The alternatives to Gamma Knife radiosurgery include conventional brain surgery, radiation therapy, and other techniques of radiation delivery, such as proton therapy, or machines such as Cyberknife or modified linear accelerators. Gamma Knife is the most established, well-researched, and validated form of radiosurgery. To help you determine the best treatment for your tumor or condition, your neurosurgeon and radiation oncologist explain the options available to you. For instance, in the majority of cases, when intracranial radiosurgery is indicated, we believe Gamma Knife is the best choice. This belief is reflected in the general medical literature, and is also documented by our own published results. We see patients at locations in Manhattan, Westchester County, and on Long Island. At NYU Langone’s Center for Esophageal Health, our experts provide highly specialized care for people who have complex conditions of the esophagus and persistent, challenging symptoms that require advanced diagnosis and treatment. Our expertise allows us to offer leading-edge diagnostic testing, innovative therapies, and surgical options to people whose symptoms—chronic heartburn, regurgitation, belching, throat discomfort, difficulty swallowing, or non-cardiac chest pain—recur despite prior treatment.

A Personalized Approach to Care Our team understands that no two people—or their symptoms—are alike. We carefully review your medical history, perform a thorough physical exam, and use the most sophisticated diagnostic tests available to understand the relationship between your symptoms and the functioning of your gastrointestinal tract. We use all of this information to determine the cause of your symptoms, and then we partner with you to create a personalized treatment plan for your health needs. Our experts partner with you to create a personalized treatment plan for your health needs. We also coordinate with your referring doctor and, when needed, specialists in other areas, such as allergy medicine; cardiology; ear, nose, and throat medicine; physical therapy; pulmonology; sleep medicine; and speech and swallowing therapy, among others, to accurately diagnose the underlying cause of your symptoms. Specialized Diagnostic Capabilities Our experts use highly specialized diagnostic techniques and leading technology to provide an accurate diagnosis. In addition to general upper gastrointestinal diagnostic testing, such as barium esophagram and upper endoscopy, we use tests including the following: high-resolution esophageal manometry with impedance, which allows doctors to examine the esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscles that form a valve between the esophagus and stomach, as well as how the esophagus functions during swallowing 24-hour pH impedance testing, which measures the extent to which stomach contents move into the esophagus over a full day 48- to 96-hour wireless pH testing, which measures and records the level of acidity in your esophagus over multiple days functional lumen imaging probe evaluation, also known as FLIP, a minimally invasive procedure that measures the diameter and contractions of the esophagus advanced techniques to diagnose Barrett’s esophagus, including WATS 3D brush biopsy, which may detect early esophageal cancer, and confocal laser, which provides precise and detailed imaging during a biopsy endoscopic ultrasound, also known as EUS, which can provide images through the wall of the esophagus not seen with standard upper endoscopy We offer a full range of treatment options, including diet and lifestyle recommendations, complementary and integrative medical approaches, behavioral psychology treatments and counseling, physical therapies such as swallowing therapy, and the latest available prescribed medications. Our examinations and diagnostic testing may also lead us to recommend other innovative treatments and surgical options.

Cancers of the colon and rectum are sometimes called , or just colon cancer. At NYU Langone, we’re working to help prevent colon cancer and to detect it at its earliest stages, when it’s highly curable. Most colon cancers develop from precancerous growths called polyps. Precancerous polyps and early colon cancers often cause no symptoms. This is why colorectal cancer screening is key to early detection and prevention. Several types of screening tests are available, including colonoscopy, which is the most comprehensive method to screen for colon cancer. NYU Langone gastroenterologists like Dr. Mark Pochapin specialize in colonoscopy screening for the prevention and early detection of colon cancer. Current guidelines recommend that people who are at average risk for colon cancer begin screening at age 45. Those with certain risk factors—including a family history of advanced polyps, called adenomas, or colorectal cancer—should begin screening at an earlier age, in accordance with their health provider’s guidance. Screening Options for Colon and Rectal Cancers According to the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer Screening, people age 45 or older should consult with their provider to choose one of the following first-line colorectal cancer screening options: FIT test At NYU Langone’s Colon Cancer Screening and Prevention Program, our gastroenterologists are highly trained and skilled in performing colonoscopies. Through this screening, they can detect and remove polyps before they turn into cancer, or detect colon cancer in its earliest stages. Our gastroenterology offices and procedure centers are conveniently located throughout New York City and Long Island. Two other screening tests, the FIT test or FIT kit, and the multitarget DNA stool test, called Cologuard, can be performed at home. A follow-up colonoscopy is only required if test results are abnormal. Learn more about colonoscopy, other screening tests, and how and when we screen for colon cancer . Your primary care provider or a gastroenterologist can help you decide which option is best for you and schedule a screening. A Modern Approach to Colon and Rectal Cancer Screenings At NYU Langone’s Colon Cancer Screening and Prevention Program, we are dedicated to studying the newest technologies—including innovations in artificial intelligence—to help make colonoscopy and other screening methods even more effective. Our experts collaborate closely with referring physicians, primary care physicians, and other specialists to ensure a comprehensive, compassionate, and patient-centered approach to care. If you receive a diagnosis of colon cancer, our experts at NYU Langone’s can partner with you to create a highly specialized, personalized plan for treatment, care, and support.

Scientific investigation is also an important part of our CTEPH Program. We collaborate with international CTEPH experts on research to advance our understanding of the condition and to improve treatment options. What Causes CTEPH? CTEPH is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension, which is elevated blood pressure in the lungs. The condition occurs when blood vessels in the lung have been blocked by a clot for a long time. The clots that trigger CTEPH often form elsewhere, most commonly in the leg, a condition known as . A clot in the leg can travel to the heart and lung and become lodged in the lung vessels. This is known as a pulmonary embolism. A clot can also form from within the lung: this is known as a thrombus. Most pulmonary clots resolve on their own or with the use of anticoagulants, also called blood thinners. However, in CTEPH, the clot does not resolve and becomes scar tissue on the inside of a lung artery. This scar tissue can make it harder for blood to flow through the lungs, and it increases the work of the right side of the heart. These are some of the symptoms people with CTEPH have: shortness of breath, especially during physical activity chest pain and discomfort swelling of the legs heart palpitations, dizzy spells, and blackouts Over time, pressure in blood vessels of the lungs can cause the right side of the heart to become weak. If left untreated, this can lead to right heart failure and, in severe cases, death. CTEPH affects up to 5 percent of people who have pulmonary embolism. About half of those with CTEPH are not aware of a prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. To learn more about our program and schedule an appointment, please call 212-263-1260. Our specialists have extensive experience in diagnosing and treating CTEPH. William H. Moore Chest Imaging Specialist Caroline W.

Complex Surgery Restores Health of Short-of-Breath Athlete Facial Paralysis & Reanimation Center 646-501-7906 Your face is one of the most identifiable things about you. When it has been altered by sudden or chronic facial paralysis, that can have a profound impact on your appearance. At NYU Langone’s Facial Paralysis and Reanimation Center, we understand the challenges of and specialize in creating a personalized treatment approach that is focused on achieving the best results for you. Facial Nerve Paralysis in Adults Medication, surgery, and rehabilitation therapy are used to treat facial nerve paralysis. The Facial Paralysis and Reanimation Center is led by a team of experts from multiple areas of medicine, including otolaryngology, ophthalmology , and neurology as well as rehabilitation experts from NYU Langone’s Causes of Facial Paralysis Paralysis is caused by injury to the facial nerve. The most common cause of sudden facial paralysis is Bell’s palsy. It may also be present from birth, occurring during childbirth or as a result of a genetic condition. Facial paralysis can also occur following a head injury or result from a bacterial or viral infection, including Lyme disease, infections of the middle ear, or herpes zoster oticus, also known as Ramsey-Hunt syndrome. The removal of intracranial or parotid tumors vascular malformations can also cause sudden facial paralysis. Facial paralysis usually affects one side of the face. It may cause a person to lose the ability to smile, blink, or move their face in other ways. Certain areas of the face, such as the brow, the cheek, or the lower lip, might droop. This affects both your appearance as well as your ability to speak, eat, drink, and protect the eye. Treatment for Facial Paralysis At the Facial Paralysis and Reanimation Center, our experts meet regularly to discuss individual patient’s unique concerns. This collaboration among NYU Langone experts from diverse specialties results in a customized solution that is aimed at improving your appearance and restoring normal function. The treatment options for facial paralysis are broad, and our experts guide you through the treatment process. Treatments can be medical, surgical, rehabilitative, or, more commonly, all three. Electrodiagnostic testing, including electroneuronography, electromyography, and audiology, is used evaluate the chance that the paralysis will recover on its own and not require surgery. Often, medication can be used to treat facial paralysis. Interventions include botulinum toxin injection to treat uncoordinated facial muscle movements. Facial filler can even out any asymmetry within the face. If surgery is needed, our expert doctors determine the approach that is best for you. include: browlift, upper eyelid weight placement, and lower lid resuspension for the eye and brow region facial nerve decompression to reduce the harmful effects of inflammation on the nerve and jumpstart recovery intracranial or intratemporal nerve grafting and rerouting to restore function to the facial muscles local muscle transposition, contralateral muscle ligation, and platysmal ligation to treat the lower lip and neck suspension slings to elevate the corner of the mouth and restore a symmetric smile, help with nasal breathing, and improve your ability to eat and drink temporalis tendon transfer and gracilis free flap techniques to restore facial movement and function to the muscles of the face through surrounding nerves including the masseteric nerve, hypoglossal nerve, opposite facial nerve, and ansa cervicalis nerve These surgical techniques are designed to provide a permanent solution that improves facial symmetry and function. Our physicians specialize in facial and reconstructive surgery, otolaryngology, and head and neck surgery. Danielle Eytan Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgeon David R. Friedmann Adam S. Jacobson Head & Neck Surgeon Daniel Jethanamest Judy W. Lee NYU Langone plastic surgeons offer a noninvasive weight loss treatment that can trim inches of fat off the waistline, back, thighs, and arms. The treatment, called Vanquish, works best for people who have tried other weight loss and exercise programs but have not been able to trim those last few inches from trouble areas. For long lasting results, Vanquish works best when used as part of a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Most patients see results within one to three months. How Noninvasive Fat Removal Works Vanquish works by targeting the fat cells that sit between your skin and muscle. The Vanquish device delivers heat at a radiofrequency that affects only fat cells, not the surrounding tissue. The radiofrequency destroys the fat cells, which then leave the body through the urinary system. NYU Langone experts recommend four, 45-minute treatment sessions for optimal results. During the treatment, you lie on a table while the heat-emitting panels are positioned above the target area. When the procedure begins, you feel a warm sensation throughout the treatment zone. There is no physical contact with the panels, and the treatment is pain free. After the session is over, we recommend that you drink water to help your body naturally flush out the dead fat cells. For more information about the Vanquish treatment, including cost, please call At the myFace Family Support Center at NYU Langone, which is a part of our cleft and craniofacial services , we understand the psychological, emotional, and social impact that facial differences can have on a person and his or her family. Facial differences can be congenital—present at birth—and include conditions such as a cleft lip and palate. If they occur later in life, they are referred to as “acquired” and may be the result of an accident or trauma. We believe that the psychological and social wellbeing of our patients and their families is just as important as the best medical care and surgical outcomes. We offer a range of services that include psychological assessments, psycho-educational workshops, short-term and ongoing psychotherapy, innovative social programs, and referrals for neuropsychological evaluations. Psychological and academic testing is also provided. Experts at the myFace Family Support Center provide counseling to parents of children who are born with facial differences. Services may be initiated as early as the prenatal period, when a child is identified in the womb as having facial differences, and continue throughout the course of a person’s medical and surgical treatment. Patient Support We can assist with a variety of issues that people with facial differences may experience. These may include , social inhibitions, anger, and “acting out” behaviors. Throughout a patient’s treatment journey, we offer supportive counseling to patients as well as their parents, siblings, spouses, and significant others.

Robotic surgery provides surgeons with greater visibility and reach in the narrow cavity of the pelvis, which allows these procedures to be performed with greater safety and precision. Vaginoplasty and Related Procedures Vaginoplasty includes creation of a clitoris, labia majora, and labia minora, removal of the testicles and erectile tissue, and shortening of the urethra. A vaginal canal is created between the rectum and prostate. A robotic approach is especially helpful in the creation of the vaginal canal because it allows us to use a peritoneal flap, sometimes called peritoneal pull-through or the Davydov procedure, to achieve greater vaginal depth. As leaders in this procedure, we have published detailed information about robotic peritoneal flap vaginoplasty surgery. View a video that describes this procedure in detail . Please note that this video is graphic. Phalloplasty Surgery to create a penis is a multiple step process that is unique for each person and based on their desired outcome. Phalloplasty uses skin from another location on the body, such as the forearm or thigh, to make a penis. Your surgeons use microsurgery techniques to connect blood vessels and nerves that allow for blood flow to and sensation in the penis. Urethral lengthening, which creates a longer urine channel through the penis, is possible. Our surgeons perform this procedure along with vaginectomy to remove the vagina. You may also choose to have scrotoplasty to create a scrotum. Once the initial reconstruction is complete you can also choose to have erectile devices and testicular implants.

Our doctors work closely with you and your family to determine a personalized dysphagia treatment plan. Our collaborative approach to treating dysphagia ensures you get the care that's right for you. Diagnosing Dysphagia Our goal is to find the precise cause of swallowing difficulties to improve your quality of life so you can enjoy eating again. Our team of laryngologists, pulmonologists, and gastroenterologists collaborate on a complete evaluation of the esophagus, mouth, throat, and vocal cord muscles to determine any structural or functional issues that may affect swallowing. These are some of the potential causes of dysphagia: aging autoimmune, neurological, and pulmonary disorders cysts diverticulosis gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, or LPR, when stomach acid travels to the throat polyps stricture, the narrowing of an organ To confirm a diagnosis of dysphagia, we use on-site testing methods that include the following: barium swallow study and videofluoroscopic swallow study, in which an X-ray is taken of the mouth, neck, and chest to evaluate abnormalities in the swallowing mechanism or digestive tract flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, which uses a fiberoptic endoscope in the throat to visualize the actual swallow in progress transnasal esophagoscopy, the insertion of an endoscope through the nose to the stomach If additional testing is needed, we collaborate with doctors at NYU Langone’s to perform the following studies: esophageal manometry, the placement of a thin catheter into the esophagus to measure movement and pressures during swallowing pH testing, to evaluate patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and laryngopharyngeal reflux disease by monitoring acid exposure within the esophagus and voice box Following diagnosis, we consult with our voice and swallowing therapists, physiatrists, and head and neck surgeons to determine your optimal treatment plan. Our doctors spend considerable time discussing your care, which may include dietary and exercise recommendations, body repositioning while eating, prescription medications, , and rehabilitative services.

Voice therapy is the most common treatment, but some people may need surgery to remove advanced nodules. Laryngitis Laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx. Treatment depends largely on the cause of the inflammation, but may involve a combination of vocal rest, fluid intake, improved vocal hygiene, or voice therapy, as well as medicines to treat the infection. Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Laryngopharyngeal reflux, or acid reflux, refers to the backflow of stomach acid into the throat that causes a hoarse voice, chronic throat clearing, the feeling of having a lump in your throat, or trouble swallowing. The treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux usually involves a combination of approaches, including dietary and behavioral modifications, medications to reduce stomach acid, and in some cases surgery to prevent further damage caused by reflux. Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis causes wartlike lesions to grow on the vocal folds. Surgery to remove these papillomas is the traditional treatment for this condition, but medications and in-office laser treatment can also provide relief. The Voice Center is a leader in research into better understanding recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Muscle Tension Dysphonia Muscle tension dysphonia refers to an abnormal pattern of voice use, resulting in the improper use of the muscles of the voice box and often a change to the quality of the voice. Voice therapy is the most common and effective treatment. Spasmodic Dysphonia Spasmodic or spastic dysphonia is a disorder that causes abnormal speech. The most common and reliable therapy involves the use of Botox, a medication containing a very small amount of botulinum toxin, to weaken the vocal cords and limit the abnormal contractions. Teflon Granulomas After its introduction in 1962, Teflon injections became a popular treatment for paralyzed vocal cords. Unfortunately, the injections caused Teflon granuloma formations and scarring of the vocal cords. Completely removing these granulomas is often very difficult. However, at the Voice Center, we specialize in a treatment method that allows a complete removal of Teflon granulomas as well as reconstruction of the vocal folds. Vocal Cord Granulomas Vocal granuloma is a particular type of laryngeal lesion that forms in the back portion of the voice box. People with granulomas may complain of hoarseness, chronic throat clearing, throat pain, a cough that is occasionally blood-tinged, and feel a lump in their throat. Treatment includes voice therapy, Botox injections into the vocal cord, or surgery to remove the lesion. Vocal Fold Paralysis Paralysis of one or both vocal folds, also known as vocal cords, can cause hoarseness, vocal fatigue, pain, aspiration, or tightness in the throat when speaking and breathing. Treatment of vocal cord paralysis differs depending on whether the paralysis affects one or both of the vocal folds. Vocal Cord Polyps Vocal cord polyps are benign lesions, similar to vocal cord nodules, that can cause hoarseness, constant throat clearing, coughing, and trouble swallowing. Small polyps, often caused by irritants such as tobacco smoke, may respond to alone. Other polyps, particularly those that are large or cause bleeding, often require surgery. Airway and Breathing Conditions Laryngologists at the Voice Center treat breathing problems by opening the airway to improve respiration. Subglottic and Tracheal Stenosis Narrowing of the airway can sometimes be the result of subglottic or tracheal stenosis, conditions that make it difficult to get adequate amounts of air to the lungs. Endoscopic surgical techniques can help open the airway. Your doctor might also recommend a stent, a type of surgical scaffolding, to keep the airway open, or a tracheostomy, which creates an opening through the neck directly to the windpipe. Vocal Cord Dysfunction Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD), also referred to as paradoxical vocal fold motion, occurs when the vocal cords do not open and close normally when you breathe. In certain circumstances, a sudden and severe VCD attack requires immediate emergency room treatment. Symptoms of VCD include shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, frequent coughing, loud breathing, and hoarseness. VCD may be caused by a respiratory infection, a strong response to very potent odors, acid reflux, postnasal drip, stress, exercise, or tobacco smoke, particularly secondhand smoke. Doctors at the Voice Center can perform tests to determine if the VCD is accompanied by or other conditions. We look closely at your vocal cords and may perform a spirometry exam to test how well you breathe and how your lungs are performing. VCD can be difficult to diagnose, so seeking out care during an attack can help you get the treatment you need. The treatment for VCD may include respiratory retraining therapy, stress management, and treatment of underlying conditions such as asthma. Swallowing Disorders Our multidisciplinary team of experts collaborate to determine the cause of your condition and provide treatment and rehabilitative services. Aspiration Aspiration is the abnormal entry of food or liquid into the windpipe and from there into the lungs. Aspiration may lead to pneumonia or other long-term lung complications. Treatment may include dietary changes, adjusting the position of your head when you eat, or swallowing exercises. Some patients may require therapy or surgery to improve their swallowing mechanism. If you have started experiencing , which is difficulty swallowing, we encourage you to seek immediate treatment to avoid dehydration, malnourishment, and other health concerns. Zenker’s Diverticulum Zenker’s diverticulum is an anatomic abnormality that results in a pouch forming alongside the esophagus. The pouch fills with food or liquid, which may then be regurgitated into the throat, leading to swallowing difficulties or aspiration. Treatment includes surgery to remove the pouch. For more information, please call us at Surgical Treatment for Voice Disorders In some cases, surgery is the best option for treating a voice, swallowing, or airway-related condition. At NYU Langone’s , our surgeons are experts at providing care that treats your underlying condition while also preserving your vocal quality. Laser Surgery Laser surgery is a common treatment for vocal cord cancer in its earliest stages. The laser enables microscopic precision that preserves as much normal tissue as possible, thus limiting the impact on the voice and swallowing after surgery. A one-time surgical operation can be offered as an alternative to six weeks of standard radiation therapy. Surgeons at the Voice Center, including Dr. Milan R. Amin, use advanced, minimally invasive surgical techniques to help preserve vocal quality. Phonomicrosurgery Phonomicrosurgery uses microsurgical instruments and techniques to improve vocal function. The technique is used in the following procedures to address problems with the voice, breathing, or swallowing: biopsy of throat lesions injection laryngoplasty, sometimes called vocal fold augmentation, which is the injection of a substance into one or both of the vocal cords to bring them closer together in order to produce a stronger voice laryngeal reinnervation, which creates a new nerve supply for a paralyzed vocal cord laryngectomy, the surgical removal of the voice box, which is most often used to treat advanced laryngeal cancer laryngoplasty, a procedure designed to permanently change the shape of the voice box to improve the voice microlaryngoscopy, a surgical technique that uses a microscope and specialized microinstruments to perform extremely precise excisions and other interventions on the delicate structures of the vocal cords tracheostomy, which is the insertion of a tube into the trachea, or windpipe, to enable easier breathing For more information about surgical care provided by the Voice Center, please call Our specialists are experts at diagnosing, evaluating, and managing chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), in which fibrotic scar tissue forms on the inside of a lung artery after . We are one of the only centers in the United States to offer pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. This surgical procedure, the gold standard for treatment, is highly effective at stopping its progression. Diagnosing and Evaluating CTEPH Upon referral to our program and before your first appointment, the CTEPH team reviews all your medical records and tests. Our specialists may order a variety of additional tests to diagnose and evaluate the condition. This helps us create a treatment plan and determine whether you are a candidate for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. To do this, you may be given tests such as the following: a , or computed tomography, performed with a special protocol and reviewed by radiologists to identify scar tissue inside of the arteries in the lungs a ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) scan, a test that identifies problems between the air and blood flow in the lungs echocardiography , a noninvasive ultrasound that provides information about the structure and function of the heart and pulmonary artery pressure a right heart catheter study, in which a catheter is inserted into a vein in the neck or groin to measure the pressures in the chambers of the heart and the pulmonary artery; this is the most accurate way to confirm a CTEPH diagnosis If you are a candidate for surgery, your team may recommend more tests, such as blood tests, pulmonary or coronary angiograms, an X-ray of the arteries in the lungs or heart taken with contrast dye, ultrasounds of the veins and arteries, lung function tests, and exercise tests. Advanced Treatment Options for CTEPH CTEPH is a manageable condition, and there are treatments that can potentially stop its progression or even resolve it. Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is a highly effective treatment for CTEPH. For this procedure, the surgeon makes an incision through the sternum, or breastbone, and then places the patient on a heart–lung bypass machine and systematically cools the body to preserve organ function. The surgeon opens the affected pulmonary artery and carefully removes the scar tissue from the inner layer of the blood vessel. Both lungs are explored, and all the major blood vessels are cleaned of scar tissue. Briefly stopping the heart–lung machine reduces bleeding and allows for the most accurate removal of scar tissue. After the procedure, patients recover in the intensive care unit for several days and for 10 to 14 days in the hospital. Your care team may recommend spending some time at the program at to build up your strength and stamina before going home. Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty Our interventional cardiologists at may manage CTEPH with a balloon pulmonary angioplasty, which is less invasive than surgery. For this procedure, a doctor threads a catheter into a lung artery and inflates a balloon to open the blood vessel, improving blood flow. This approach may be recommended for people who are not candidates for surgery. Pulmonary Hypertension Medication Another option for managing CTEPH is to prescribe pulmonary hypertension medications to reduce the pressure inside the pulmonary arteries and to improve the function of the right side of the heart. People who cannot have surgery or an angioplasty or people who have residual pulmonary hypertension after these interventions may benefit from taking these medications. Testing Offered at the Voice Center , we provide the specialized testing required to accurately diagnose the cause of your voice, swallowing, or breathing-related condition. Testing for Voice Disorders At the Voice Center, we provide an individualized treatment plan based on the results of our advanced diagnostic testing for voice problems. Advanced voice disorder testing, performed by experts like Dr. Aaron Johnson, offers insight into many voice conditions. Stroboscopy Stroboscopy is a way to examine the vibratory nature of the vocal cords. The technique uses a strobe light that is linked to the frequency of the patient’s voice. When a person utters a tone, the light flashes at a frequency that is close to that of the person’s voice. The result is a set of images that mimic the vibration of the vocal cords. Doctors use this information to diagnose and evaluate the vocal cords for the presence of cancer, scar tissue, or stiffness, as well as muscle tone. Voice Analysis Hoarseness is often a complicated condition to evaluate because vocal changes can be very subtle. We use a series of tests to analyze your voice and help determine the cause. Typically, the evaluation involves a voice recording, which is then run through a series of computer programs that analyze the data. This analysis provides information on your vocal quality and ability and helps us determine the best way to help you get better. Testing for Swallowing Disorders Our team may use one of several methods to examine and evaluate your swallowing problem during a visit to the Voice Center. For more information about our testing options, please call Whether it’s illness, injury, or subtle changes to the speaking or singing voice, the experts at NYU Langone’s understand that no concern is too minor when it comes to ensuring the health of your voice. Voice Center experts, including Dr. Paul E. Kwak, specialize in helping singers and actors achieve and maintain vocal health. Our specialists have a unique understanding of the professional voice. Paul E. Kwak, MD , the director of the center, are otolaryngologists who specialize in medical and surgical care for the performing voice. Aaron M. Johnson, PhD , the center’s co-director, is a speech–language pathologist who provides treatment and therapies for professional vocalists. Our patients include acting and singing students, aspiring artists who spend their days auditioning, and established professionals. They are vocal athletes, and just as in sports, vocal athletes benefit from a team approach. Our experts are uniquely equipped to manage issues specific to the elite performing voice. Diagnosis and management of vocal problems is highly individual and often complex. Our doctors conduct advanced diagnostic testing to pinpoint the causes of the problem and develop a treatment plan to get you back on stage as quickly as possible. We offer baseline vocal examinations, and highly encourage singers and actors to have this done early in their careers. This information can help us identify subtle changes in vocal quality that can impact performance. We also teach healthy vocal habits, including efficient voice use, that can help preserve your voice over the long term. We are also actively involved in into how the voice works, so we can come up with new and better ways to ensure your best, lifelong vocal quality. For more information, please call Payment & Insurance Coverage for Weight Loss Surgery After you have completed all of the steps to prepare for weight loss surgery , our staff at NYU Langone’s is able to discuss payment options. If you are planning to pay for the surgery yourself, known as out-of-pocket payment, please make sure you bring the correct documentation to your first appointment. If you are planning to have your surgery covered by insurance, you need to complete the authorization process required by your insurance carrier. NYU Langone’s Weight Management Program is recognized as part of the Aetna Institutes of Quality Bariatric Surgery Network, a Cigna Bariatric Center of Excellence, a Blue Cross Blue Shield Blue Distinction Center for Bariatric Surgery, and a HIP Emblem Center of Excellence. Insurance Coverage for Weight Loss Surgery Insurance coverage for obesity surgery varies according to the insurance carrier. Those that cover bariatric, or weight loss, surgery often limit their coverage to certain types of surgery. Insurance companies that cover bariatric surgery have varying requirements. Some may require medical records documenting that you have medical problems caused by your weight or records of your participation in medically supervised weight loss programs. In fact, many insurers require at least six months’ participation in a supervised weight loss program within two years of your proposed surgery date. Our office participates with many insurance plans. But whether we participate or not, our surgical scheduler can work with you and your insurance company to obtain authorization for your surgery. Each insurance plan is unique, and getting authorization for surgery can be a long, labor-intensive process. Prior to visiting our office, please do the following steps: Call your insurance carrier and make sure your plan provides coverage for weight loss surgery, and that you have covered benefits for morbid obesity surgery. Policies can change daily. Regardless of your insurance carrier, call to check your coverage. Keep in mind that although you may have completed all the necessary steps in order to schedule surgery, your insurance plan may not authorize it. Write down the name of the person you speak with, including first name, last name, and direct phone number. Your insurance carrier may request the name of the surgery and the CPT/ICD-9 codes. Insurance companies use the following codes to identify the type of procedure or surgery: Lap Gastric Bypass: 43644 Lap Gastric Sleeve: 43775 Lap Gastric Banding: 43770 Diagnosis Code (ICD-10) for Morbid Obesity: E66.01 Your call to the insurance company should be for informational purposes only. Our office initiates the formal insurance authorization process after you meet with the surgeon and schedule your surgery date. Our surgical scheduler cannot initiate the authorization process until you have a surgery date, even if you have already attended our required information session and scheduled an appointment with the psychologist and nutritionist. If you initiate your surgery authorization process without having seen our surgeon, your insurance company may close your authorization case. When you have a surgery date, it may take another two weeks to two months to obtain approval from your insurance carrier. Insurance Appeals In almost all instances in which your insurance plan denies preauthorization for your surgery, you have a right to appeal that denial. Our program would not have submitted you for approval if we did not determine that surgery was medically necessary, so if the insurance plan denies the procedure, we think filing an appeal is justified. Appeals can be filed by you as a plan member, or you can appoint someone to assist you. If you intend to appeal, with or without assistance, you should carefully review and research what is needed to make a strong appeal.

After Weight Loss Surgery If you are contemplating weight loss surgery, you are probably thinking ahead to the results and what to expect during recovery. Weight loss surgery typically brings health benefits, but you may also experience some undesirable changes that can occur when a substantial amount of weight is lost in a short period of time, either through surgery or other means. , we want to help you prepare for and understand the effects, immediate and longer term, that you may experience after your procedure. Hair Loss During the first six months after surgery, almost everyone who has weight loss surgery experiences hair loss or thinning. Hair loss is alarming, but it typically doesn’t lead to baldness and is reversible. When your weight stabilizes and you consume more protein, your hair grows back. Chemical hair treatments, such as straighteners and perms, should be avoided. Nausea or Dumping Syndrome Because your new stomach pouch is quite small, you cannot eat as much food as you once did. Therefore, if you get full but continue to eat, or eat quickly without chewing thoroughly, pain and vomiting are likely to occur. You have to learn to eat more slowly, to chew food thoroughly, and to stop eating when you feel full. Overeating or consuming concentrated sweets or carbohydrates can lead to nausea and dumping syndrome, which occurs when the contents of the stomach quickly enter the small intestines, causing profuse sweating, nausea, dizziness, palpitations, and weakness. If you don’t have problems eating during the first month after surgery and then suddenly experience nausea or vomiting after eating or drinking, you may have developed a stricture, or narrowing, at the point where the stomach pouch connects with the small intestine. This can be serious—you should call your surgeon for further evaluation. Nutritional Deficiencies Nutritional deficiencies can occur, particularly in patients who have a gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion, which causes food to skip the duodenum—the section of the small intestine where most iron and calcium are absorbed. Left uncorrected, this can lead to anemia or , among other conditions. After a biliopancreatic diversion—which is designed to dramatically reduce nutrient absorption—patients have to take even greater care to avoid nutritional deficiencies. The good news is that these problems can be avoided by eating the correct foods in small amounts, taking daily vitamin and mineral supplements, and getting regular medical checkups that include blood testing. Lactose Intolerance After certain bariatric surgeries, lactase, the enzyme needed to digest milk and other dairy products, does not reach food in the usual fashion. Consequently, you may become lactose intolerant, leading to gas, cramping, and diarrhea. Try avoiding dairy products and switching to alternatives, such as soy milk, rice milk, or lactose-free milk such as Lactaid. Changed Bowel Habits Weight loss surgery can change your food intake as well as your digestion. Some patients experience constipation, which can be treated with a mild, natural stool softener or by simply drinking more fluids. After a biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch, patients may experience diarrhea. This is usually caused by having too much fat in the diet. If that is not the case, a small amount of pancreatic enzymes may be required to help your digestion, which can be prescribed by your surgeon. Loss of Muscle Mass Because you’re consuming far fewer calories and less protein, your body burns other energy stores to maintain itself. The body prefers to use protein-rich muscle for energy before it taps into fat. Therefore, your initial weight loss may come at the expense of your muscle mass. This is most common after a gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or a biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch. Fortunately, loss of muscle mass can be avoided by exercising every day and consuming more protein. We recommend both regular aerobic activity and weight lifting. These activities can be alternated, but should be done at least three times a week for 20 to 30 minutes, though daily exercise is ideal and should be your goal. Regular exercise increases fat burning, builds and tones muscle, and raises your energy level. With any rapid weight loss, there is an increased risk of developing gallstones. About 1 in 10 people who undergo bariatric surgery ultimately need to have their gallbladders removed. At NYU Langone, we do not routinely remove gallbladders at the time of weight loss surgery because most people would have their gallbladders removed unnecessarily. Instead, anyone who still has a gallbladder at the time of gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch surgery is prescribed a medication that prevents gallstones from forming after surgery. If your gallbladder still needs to be removed, it can be done laparoscopically at a later date. Excess Skin After weight loss surgery, your body may be left with excess skin. Our doctors can refer you to an NYU Langone who can remove extra skin, as well as tighten and contour your skin to your new shape. Gastric Band Adjustments If you have gastric band surgery, band adjustments are critical to the success of your surgery. If your weight loss plateaus, or if you continue to be hungry after eating, your band needs tightening. This is a simple procedure that your surgeon or nurse can usually perform in our office. On occasion, this needs to be done in the radiology department. We can also help you if you’ve had Lap-Band surgery elsewhere and require an adjustment. Weight Loss Surgery Support Groups hosts free support groups for prospective, new, and existing patients. Support groups play an important role for those who have had bariatric surgery and other weight management procedures. At NYU Langone, these groups provide a safe and encouraging environment in which people managing their weight can share experiences, celebrate milestones, and navigate challenges together. In addition, these groups may feature guidance from healthcare professionals, ensuring members receive information on nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes. For more information about a support group near you, visit our location pages: We look forward to hearing from you. People who are affected by obesity and have had limited success losing weight on their own may benefit from medically supervised weight loss through the Weight Management Program at NYU Langone. Our nonsurgical medical weight loss methods focus on proper nutrition, physical activity, and making healthier lifestyle choices. We work with you and your primary care physician, exercise experts, nutritionists, psychologists, and other specialty providers as necessary. The program welcomes anyone who has a weight concern and hopes to gain a sense of control over their weight. Please contact our locations to learn about the medical weight loss services they provide. Our main locations are: Nonmedical weight loss programs include meal replacement programs and exercise guidance. Meal Replacement Programs Meal replacements can be an effective tool choosing nutritionally balanced, low-calorie foods. They offer a convenient and controlled way to manage calorie intake while ensuring nutritional needs are met. These products are designed to replace one or more meals per day and are often formulated with balanced macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals to support overall health. When used as part of a structured program, under the supervision of one of our weight management providers, meal replacements can help to achieve and maintain weight loss goals. Medical Evaluations of Weight-Related Conditions Many medical conditions can worsen as a person gains weight. Weight loss is often the best way to manage these conditions, which include metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, and movement issues, such as . We help you manage these conditions while you lose weight and optimize your overall health. Women who have polycystic ovary syndrome or a history of gestational diabetes have unique vulnerabilities related to insulin resistance. Our providers work intensively with you to develop safe, effective meal plans that can jump-start and accelerate weight loss. We have several options for those who need to lose weight prior to a medical procedure. We can even help people who have tried traditional diet plans but have been dissatisfied with the results. Review of Medications Many medications used to manage conditions such as diabetes, seizure disorders , arthritis, and contribute to weight gain. There may be alternative medications or ways to manage these conditions that allow you to take less medicine. Our clinicians work with your primary care physician to suggest helpful strategies. Medications for Weight Loss that control feelings of hunger can often help you stick with a new eating plan. Medications are a tool for weight loss and work best when used as part of a comprehensive weight management plan that includes dietary changes and exercise. Metabolic Rate Testing Metabolism analysis helps to determine your metabolic rate, which is a calculation based on body fat, muscle mass, age, gender, and fluid retention. Your metabolic rate helps to determine how many calories your body burns while at rest. This information is used by our experts to come up with a diet strategy focused on consuming fewer calories than you burn in a day. The testing, which uses a body composition analyzer, is quick, painless, and does not require a blood test or fasting. Individual Meal Planning Planning out meals in advance, awareness of the nutritional value of the foods you choose, and being accountable to your goals can be crucial for weight loss success. We teach you how to create a healthy eating plan and maintain a food diary. Mindful Eating and Nutrition Planning Mindful eating is a cornerstone of our care. We discuss your eating habits, what triggers eating, and how to distinguish “head hunger,” which is wanting to eat even though you are not truly hungry, from your body’s true metabolic needs. We also discuss ways to manage stress that do not include food. Knowing how to read food labels and menus to find the best choices, as well as understanding food composition, plays a part in mindful eating. Our registered dietitians teach you how to incorporate nutritional knowledge into your busy life while also balancing your family’s food preferences. Self-Monitoring Tools The bathroom scale, food diaries, and label reading can all help you reach your weight loss goals and maintain a healthy weight. We help you figure out which self-monitoring tools are best for you, and how often you should use them. Exercise Guidance Our providers help you set exercise goals that are aligned with your current fitness level and that can be used at your local gym, at home, or in the community. We understand how difficult it can be to add regular physical activity into your busy lifestyle, so we also provide guidance that makes physical activity more enjoyable, and therefore easier to maintain as a healthy habit. Our recommendations are based on professional guidelines such as those from the American College of Sports Medicine. To make an appointment to learn more about our nonsurgical medical weight loss options, please schedule with one of weight loss experts We offer in-person follow-up appointments, or you can also choose to have an online provider visit through the .

Plastic surgeons at NYU Langone reconstruct the breast after surgery and improve the overall appearance of the breast for those seeking reconstructive or cosmetic plastic surgery. We offer all of the latest reconstruction techniques, including the following: breast reduction using the short scar method, which involves a smaller incision than traditional techniques and thus has more cosmetically appealing results breast lift surgery, or mastopexy secondary breast reconstruction and augmentation surgery, which is performed as a separate procedure after surgery to remove all or part of the breast We also perform breast reconstruction using perforator flaps. In this procedure, performed using microvascular surgical techniques, a new breast is created by using tissue removed from either the stomach or buttocks. Techniques we use include the deep inferior epigastric perforator, known as DIEP, and superior gluteal artery perforator, also known as S-GAP. Our plastic surgeons, including Dr. Eduardo D. Rodriguez and Dr. Nolan S. Karp, specialize in the latest techniques to perform breast reconstruction and cosmetic breast surgery. Our surgeons are experts in the treatment of the following conditions: breast sagging, also known as breast ptosis breast hyperplasia or macromastia, a benign condition resulting in the overgrowth of breast cells breast hypoplasia, known as underdevelopment Breast in a Day Breast in a Day is an innovative surgery for women diagnosed with breast cancer and for those who are at increased risk for cancer. It involves performing two procedures at the same time in one day—a nipple-sparing mastectomy , in which the whole skin envelope of the breast is saved, leaving the nipple and areola intact, and breast reconstruction using implants. For many women who choose a double mastectomy, breast reconstruction is often performed in multiple surgeries and can take up to a year to fully complete. Breast in a Day requires fewer surgeries, which means less time in the hospital. Many women find that immediate reconstruction performed in one step, known as direct implant reconstruction, can play a significant role in physical and emotional recovery. Breast in a Day is an option for women who are at high risk for breast cancer or have breast cancer that does not involve the nipple areola, and who choose to have a prophylactic mastectomy before any cancer develops. At NYU Langone, women who choose to have a mastectomy with implant reconstruction may be candidates for direct implants instead of temporary implants or expanders. NYU Langone seamlessly brings together the best in oncologic and reconstructive breast surgery. Our breast surgical oncologists at and our plastic surgeons maintain ongoing communication throughout the planning process, and create a customized surgical plan for each patient. We use three-dimensional imaging to assist in preoperative planning, long-term evaluation, and follow-up care after breast reduction, reconstruction, or augmentation. Our breast plastic surgery services are offered as part of our internationally renowned Hansjörg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery. We offer innovative and technologically advanced techniques for all types of reconstructive and cosmetic breast surgery.

You can also ask any doctors you have seen outside NYU Langone to fax medical records relevant to your current problem to Risks & Benefits of Weight Loss Surgery Bariatric surgery, also known as weight loss surgery, comes with risks and benefits. We encourage you to discuss these with your family and doctors before you choose to have a weight loss procedure at NYU Langone’s Benefits of Weight Loss Surgery Weight loss surgery can improve your quality of life in many ways. The constant feelings of hunger you experience diminish, and you may become less preoccupied with food. As you lose significant amounts of weight, you have more energy, and everyday activities no longer leave you short of breath. Just a few months after surgery, you may begin to feel proud of the way you look and feel as you start to fit into smaller clothing. As your focus on food lessens, you may discover more outside interests. Feelings of self-consciousness may be gradually replaced by feelings of confidence and self-control. Bariatric surgery not only helps you lose excess weight and keep it off, it also improves or eliminates most medical problems associated with . When you begin to lose weight, you can usually cut down, or stop taking, medications for these various conditions. For instance, many people with diabetes see their blood sugar levels normalize within days of the operation. It is important to remember, though, that bariatric surgery is not a magic elixir for weight loss. It is a tool to be used along with diet and exercise to achieve a healthier life. Surgery is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle, but it allows diet and exercise to actually work. The ultimate measures of bariatric surgery are how much weight is lost, how long the weight loss lasts, the improvement in your health and quality of life, and safety. Risks of Weight Loss Surgery Bariatric surgery does come with several risks to your health. Atelectasis Atelectasis is the partial collapse of the lungs. It is very common after surgery, especially in people who are obese, to have the bottom portion of the lungs become “squashed,” opening only with coughing and very deep breaths. This can lead to problems such as fever, pneumonia, or shortness of breath. Atelectasis can be prevented or alleviated by performing deep-breathing exercises and coughing after surgery. is a blood clot in the lungs. The problem begins in the legs, where blood clots can form in the veins of the calves or thighs, especially if the legs are stationary. Such clots can cause swelling or pain in the leg. However, they present the most danger if they break off and travel to the lungs. A large clot can cause shortness of breath or completely block blood from entering the lungs, causing death. People who are overweight have a higher risk of forming blood clots in the legs, particularly during or soon after surgery. To prevent pulmonary emboli during and after surgery, your legs are fitted with sequential compression boots. They act like blood pressure cuffs to massage your legs and prevent blood clots from forming. You are also given a small dose of blood thinner, called heparin, at the time of surgery. The best prevention, though, is to get out of bed and walk around soon after surgery. Bowel Leakage Leakage of bowel contents—from the new connection between the stomach and the small intestine or between two parts of intestine—is the most serious complication of gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion. A leak from a burst staple line in the sleeve gastrectomy can also occur. Such leaks can cause a high heart rate, pain in the abdomen or back, fever, infection, and even death. Treatment usually entails antibiotic therapy or surgical repair, depending on the size of the leak. In the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a new stomach pouch is made from the top of the stomach, and the rest of the organ is detached and left alone. The stomach remnant remains alive, but it shrinks in size. In rare instances, a blockage can develop in the stomach remnant, causing a backup of fluid and leakage of bowel contents. This condition can be difficult to diagnose because it does not cause vomiting. If it occurs, you need to have an abdominal CT scan. If your stomach is found to be inflated, you are given local anesthesia, and it is deflated with a small needle. Difficulty Eating In gastric bypass surgery, the connection between the new stomach pouch and the intestine is created using a stapling technique. As with all surgical healing, a scar forms. Sometimes, this scar can tighten around the connection and cause it to narrow to a point where food cannot pass through. This problem typically occurs four to six weeks after surgery. It can be corrected by stretching the narrowed opening, which is done endoscopically. A gastroenterologist inserts a tube down your throat while you are lightly sedated to widen the opening. In people who have had a sleeve gastrectomy, the banana-shaped stomach may become too narrow due to scar tissue, leading to difficulty eating or even drinking. Stretching by endoscopy may be necessary; or in extreme cases, corrective surgery, also known as , may be required. In people who have had gastric band surgery, the opening between the upper and lower stomach pouches can also become too narrow. This can be corrected with a simple adjustment to loosen the band. In rare instances, the gastric band can slip and cause constant regurgitation and heartburn. Symptoms can be relieved by loosening the band in an office visit. The diagnosis is confirmed with a barium-swallow study. If this happens, the band would likely need to be repositioned with another operation, which is done laparoscopically. A special diet of liquids, shakes, and purees for the first month after surgery helps prevent this condition. Other Risks On rare occasions after gastric band surgery, the band erodes into the stomach. This does not cause pain, but may result in inadequate weight loss. This is diagnosed by endoscopy. The condition is repaired with surgery, which we perform laparoscopically. As with any operation, the incision site can become infected. In overweight patients with more fat in the abdominal walls, the infection can be deeper than usual. You are prescribed oral antibiotics for a minor infection. Deeper, more serious infections may require opening the wound and packing it with gauze in addition to giving antibiotics. Sometimes, weight loss surgeries do not work. You may not lose enough weight to improve your health, or you may regain weight. If this is the case, you should make an appointment to see your surgeon at NYU Langone’s . Your surgeon may suggest a procedure to revise or change your weight loss surgery that may be helpful. Due to adhesions and scar tissue from the original operation, revisional surgery is more complex than the first weight loss procedure. At NYU Langone, we have some of the most extensive experience in the country in performing revisional surgery. Our surgeons and support staff are here to help. Weight Loss Surgery Options Weight loss procedures performed at NYU Langone’s include gastric sleeve, gastric bypass, single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S), one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OABG), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, commonly known as Lap-Band surgery. These procedures are performed using laparoscopic or robotic surgical techniques, which involve the use of long, slender instruments that are inserted through several small abdominal incisions. Because the incisions are small, people typically recover faster compared with those who’ve had traditional surgery, which requires a larger incision. There is no one method that is best for everyone. Each type of surgery has its own advantages and disadvantages. Several factors determine which procedure is best for you, including your body mass index, any medical conditions you may have, and your eating habits. If you’re deciding whether to have bariatric surgery, also known as weight loss surgery, you must balance the risks against the rewards of losing a large amount of weight.

Our board-certified art therapists offer opportunities for patients to use a range of art materials. Art therapy is about the process, not the product; therefore, no degree of artistic skill is needed to participate. Internship Program NYU Langone also offers internships to students in clinical degree programs in therapeutic recreation, music therapy, art therapy, and child life. NYU Langone Health is a national leader in quality and innovation, tracking more than 800 metrics to assess the ongoing performance of our healthcare providers and programs. The evaluation of these measures, which include infection rates, surgical outcomes, and patient satisfaction scores, is among the most extensive in the nation and provides us with the data needed to improve patient care and achieve the best outcomes. As a result, NYU Langone consistently earns top rankings in quality and safety across our expansive network of inpatient and outpatient locations. What Does Quality Really Mean? At NYU Langone, our mortality rates are among the lowest in the nation, which is an important measure of quality care. Take our patients who’ve experienced a heart attack, for example. NYU Langone’s 30-day mortality rate for these patients across all hospitals in the system is an impressive 7.7 percent, significantly lower than the national benchmark of 13.7 percent. We have the lowest heart attack death rate in the country. This outstanding outcome is a direct result of the advanced, team-based care NYU Langone provides. We continue to expand and enhance our clinical programs, particularly in interventional cardiology, advanced heart failure, and critical care. Whether our patients need a plan to prevent heart disease , a procedure to open a blocked artery or repair a valve, or even a new heart, our specialists work together to provide the best cardiac care possible.
