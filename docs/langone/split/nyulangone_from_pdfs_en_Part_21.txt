Increases occurred from 2016 to 2020, with a larger annual percent change from 2019 to 2020 () compared with the average annual percent change from 2016 to 2019 () overall and for nearly every characteristic analyzed. In 2020, the rate of GDM varied by maternal race and Hispanic origin; among the six largest race and Hispanic origin groups, the rate was highest for non Hispanic Asian (14.) and lowest for non Hispanic Black (6.) women. Variation in the GDM rate among the Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and Hispanic subgroups was also seen. The GDM rate rose with increasing maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, and plurality. By state, for 2020, the GDM rate ranged from a low of 4. in Mississippi to a high of 12. in Alaska. Keywords: GDM • race and Hispanic origin • births • National Vital Statistics System Introduction The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth includes information on two types of diabetes (defined as glucose intolerance requiring treatment), prepregnancy (diagnosis of diabetes before pregnancy) and gestational (diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy) (1 3). Differentiating between the two types of diabetes is important because, although both are established risk factors for several adverse maternal and infant health outcomes, the conditions occur at different frequencies and have different impacts on pregnancy outcomes (4 9). The focus of this report is on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which is specific to pregnancy and occurs more frequently than prepregnancy diabetes (10 12). GDM is a common complication in pregnancy (8,13), affecting about of pregnancies in the United States annually (10,11,14). The presence of GDM can lead to negative health outcomes for both mothers and infants. Adverse health outcomes for the mother include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life, GDM in subsequent pregnancies, maternal hypertensive disorders, and having a cesarean delivery (5,8,10,15 19). Adverse health outcomes for the infant include an increased risk of preterm birth and macrosomia, and the development of type 2 diabetes later in life (5,8,17 19). Studies have found increasing GDM rates over time in both the United States and internationally (9,12,20 24), and a larger increase in GDM during the COVID 19 pandemic compared with prepandemic times (25 27). National information on GDM became available for the first time in 2016. This report presents overall trends in GDM among women giving birth in the United States from 2016 through 2020 and rates of GDM by maternal race and Hispanic origin, age, body mass index (BMI), state of residence, and plurality for 2016, 2019, and 2020. Methods This analysis uses data from the birth certificate and is based on of births registered in the United States for 2016 through 2020. Trend analysis was performed using 2016 2020 data and a more detailed analysis was conducted on 2020 data. Comparisons are made between 2016 and 2019, 2019 and 2020, and 2016 and 2020 for the overall GDM rate and all other characteristics. These time periods were selected to examine the full time period for which final national GDM data are currently available (2016 2020) and to examine changes in GDM before (2016 2019) and during (2020) the COVID 19 pandemic. The GDM item was added to the birth certificate with the 2003 revision and was reported by all states as of 2016. Birth certificate data on GDM is recommended to be collected from the mother’s medical records (1). Mothers are to be reported as having GDM if there is a diagnosis of glucose intolerance requiring treatment during this pregnancy in her medical record (2). Of the 3,613,647 births registered in the United States for 2020, 4,063, or 0., were missing GDM information. Data on BMI were missing for 1. (70,408) of births and data on Hispanic origin were missing for 0. (33,946) of births. Births with missing values for race (251,440 or 7.), age (300 or 0.), and plurality (95 or 0.) were imputed. Records missing information on GDM, BMI, and Hispanic origin were excluded from analyses. Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the birth certificate and are self reported by the mother. All race and Hispanic origin groups are based on single race reporting and are consistent with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards (28). Maternal race and Hispanic origin categories presented are non Hispanic White, non Hispanic Black, non Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), non Hispanic Asian, non Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI), and Hispanic. Data on non Hispanic Asian (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Other Asian), NHOPI (Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan, and Other Pacific Islander), and Hispanic (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, and Other and unknown Hispanic) subgroups are also shown. Maternal prepregnancy BMI is calculated from prepregnancy weight and height according to the following formula (29): mother’s prepregnancy weight (lb) • 703 mother’s height (in)2 The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides a calculated categorization of maternal prepregnancy BMI that aligns with that established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (30) for all adults. Categories are: • Underweight is BMI less than 18.5 • Normal weight is BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 • Overweight is BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 • Obese is BMI of 30.0 and over. Plurality is defined as the number of fetuses delivered live or dead at any time in the pregnancy regardless of gestational age, or if the fetuses were delivered at different dates in the pregnancy 3 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 71, No. 3, July 19, 2022 (2). Plurality is classified as singleton, twin, and triplet and higher order births. GDM rates are expressed as the number of live births to women with GDM per 100 live births. All statements about differences in rates in the text have been tested for statistical significance, and statements that a given rate is higher or lower than another rate indicate that the rates are significantly different using a two tailed z test at the alpha level of 0.05 (31). References to decreasing or increasing trends in rates (for example, trends in rates for 2016 2020) are statistically significant at the 0.05 level and were assessed using the Cochran Armitage test for trends, a modified chi squared test. Comparisons between state rates and the U.S. rate account for the individual state’s contribution to the U.S. rate. Therefore, each state rate is compared with a unique U.S. rate, independent of the state’s contribution to the total U.S. rate. The reliability of percentages was evaluated based on standards developed by NCHS. For detailed information on the standards, see “National Center for Health Statistics Data Presentation Standards for Proportions” (32). Results Overall trends • The number of GDM cases increased from 2016 (234,847) to 2020 (281,789) (Table 1). • The number of GDM cases rose by an average of annually from 2016 to 2019 and then rose from 2019 to 2020. • The GDM rate increased from 2016 (6.) to 2020 (7.) (Table 1 and Figure 1). • The GDM rate rose by an average of annually from 2016 to 2019 and then rose from 2019 to 2020. Trends and differences by maternal race and Hispanic origin • In 2020, among the six largest race and Hispanic origin groups, the rate of GDM was lowest for non Hispanic Black women (6.), followed by non Hispanic White (7.), Hispanic (8.), non Hispanic NHOPI (10.), non Hispanic AIAN (11.), and non Hispanic Asian (14.) women (Table 2 and Figure 2). • Among non Hispanic Asian subgroups, the GDM rate was highest for Asian Indian women (16.), followed by Vietnamese and Filipino (15. for each), Chinese (13.), Korean (11.), and Japanese (9.) women. • Among non Hispanic NHOPI subgroups, the GDM rate was highest for Guamanian (13.) and Samoan (12.) women and lowest for Hawaiian women (8.). • Among the Hispanic origin subgroups, the GDM rate was highest for Mexican women (8.), followed by Dominican (8.) and Puerto Rican (8.), Cuban (7.), and Central and South American (7.) women.

SOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics System, Natality. 4 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 71, No. 3, July 19, 2022 • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased for all but one of the race and Hispanic origin groups studied. Rates rose from (NHOPI) to (non Hispanic Black) among the six largest groups, by (Asian Indian and Vietnamese) to (Korean) among the Asian subgroups, and by (Central and South American) to (Cuban) among the Hispanic subgroups. Among the NHOPI subgroups, rates increased from (Hawaiian) to (Samoan); the increase for Hawaiian women was not signifcant (Table 2). • GDM rates rose by from 2019 to 2020 for each of the race and Hispanic origin groups except the Hawaiian subgroup. In comparison, for 2016 2019, GDM rates rose an average of per year for each group except for NHOPI women overall and each NHOPI subgroup. Trends and differences by maternal age • In 2020, the GDM rate increased with increasing age of the mother, from 2. for women under age 20 to 15. for those aged 40 and over (Table 3 and Figure 3). • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased for each maternal age group, ranging from (for mothers aged 40 and over) to (for those aged 20 24). • GDM rates rose for each age group from 2019 to 2020, with increases ranging from to . In comparison, from 2016 to 2019, an average annual percentage increase of in GDM rates was seen for each age group. Trends and differences by maternal BMI • In 2020, the GDM rate increased with increasing maternal BMI, from 3. for underweight women, to 4. for those who were normal weight, to 7. for those who were overweight, to 12. for those with obesity (Table 3 and Figure 4). • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased for each BMI category, from for women with obesity to for women who were underweight or normal weight. • GDM rates rose by from 2019 to 2020 for each BMI category. In comparison, from 2016 to 2019, an average annual percentage increase of in GDM rates was seen for each BMI category. Trends and differences by plurality • In 2020, the GDM rate increased with increasing plurality, from 7. among mothers having a singleton birth, to 9. for mothers of twins, to 13. for mothers of triplet and higher order multiple births (Table 3). • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased for women having singletons (), twins (), and triplet and higher order multiple births (). • GDM rates increased from 2019 to 2020 among mothers of singletons (), twins (), and triplet and higher order multiple births (). In comparison, for 2016 2019, the Figure 3. Rate of gestational diabetes, by age of mother: United States, 2020 NOTE: Significant increasing trend (p < 0.05).

SOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics System, Natality. average annual percentage increase was for mothers of singletons and for mothers of twins. The increase for mothers of triplets and higher order multiple births was not signifcant. Trends and differences by state of residence • In 2020, the GDM rate ranged from a low of 4. in Mississippi to a high of 12. in Alaska (Table 4 and Figure 5). • Compared with the U.S. rate of 7., the GDM rate was lower in 23 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.), higher in 21 states, and not signifcantly different in 6 states. • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased in 48 states and D.C. Increases ranged from in Connecticut, New Mexico, and South Carolina to in Wyoming. Increases in the remaining two states (North Dakota and West Virginia) were not signifcant (Table 4 and Figure 6). • Increases of were observed for 46 states and D.C. from 2019 to 2020. Increases for the remaining four states (Connecticut, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming) were not signifcant. In comparison, from 2016 to 2019, the average annual percent change ranged from to for 45 states and D.C. Changes for the remaining fve states were not signifcant. Discussion This report found that the overall GDM rate was 7. in 2020, an increase of from 2019 (6.) and from 2016 (6.). A larger annual percent change from 2019 to 2020 () than from 2016 to 2019 (average annual increase of ) was observed. From 2016 to 2020, GDM rates increased for every category of all characteristics analyzed, though increases for the Hawaiian subgroup and two states were not significant. Rates also increased between 2019 and 2020 for nearly all groups. The annual percent change from 2019 to 2020 was larger than the average annual percent change from 2016 to 2019 for nearly all categories of all characteristics analyzed, except changes for Hawaiian and Cuban women and nine states. In 2020, variation in the GDM rate was observed across race and Hispanic origin groups and subgroups. Among the six largest race and Hispanic origin groups, the rate for the group with the highest rate (non Hispanic Asian women) was more than double the rate for the group with the lowest rate (non Hispanic Black women). Among the Hispanic subgroups, rates were lowest for Central and South American women and highest for Mexican women. Among the Asian subgroups, the lowest rate was observed for Japanese women and the highest for Asian Indian women. For the NHOPI subgroup, the lowest rate was observed for Hawaiian women and the highest for Guamanian and Samoan women. The GDM rate rose with increasing age, BMI, and plurality. By state of residence, Alaska had the highest GDM rate, more than two and one half times higher than that for Mississippi, which had the lowest rate. 6 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 71, No. 3, July 19, 2022 Figure 5. Rate of gestational diabetes, by state of residence: United States, 2020 SOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics System, Natality. These findings are generally consistent with the findings of other studies, though some disagreement exists in the literature as to whether rates are lowest for non Hispanic Black or non Hispanic White women (5,10,17,33 42). Recent studies have also observed larger increases in GDM during the COVID 19 pandemic compared with prepandemic times (25 27). The larger than average increase in GDM during 2019 2020 may be related, in part, to changes observed in the general and at risk populations (including pregnant women), such as decreased physical activity, weight gain, and other lifestyle factors that are known to impact GDM (43 48). Limitations Underreporting of health conditions is considered a primary limitation of birth certificate data (49 50). Two studies that examined data from the 2003 birth certificate revision for three vital statistics reporting areas found low levels of sensitivity (a measure of underreporting) for GDM across all three reporting areas, ranging from 57. to 59. (51,52). However, the Kappa scores (a more conservative measure of agreement) were found to be moderate to substantial, ranging from 0.55 to 0.68 (51,52). Conclusion GDM is a common complication in pregnancy that can lead to negative health outcomes for both mothers and infants. A primary advantage of birth certificate data is that information is collected on all women giving birth in the United States each year, allowing for analysis of both national trends and trends for smaller population groups, such as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander subgroups. Despite concerns with potential reporting issues, trends and patterns in the GDM rate shown in this report are generally consistent with those of other studies and these data provide opportunities to examine GDM among a large population of women giving birth in the United States.

NYS FORM OON AOB (3/10/15) New York State Out of Network Surprise Medical Bill Assignment of Benefits Form Use this form if you receive a surprise bill for health care services and want the services to be treated as in network. To use this form, you must: (1) fill it out and sign it; (2) send a copy to your health care provider (include a copy of the bill or bills); and (3) send a copy to your insurer (include a copy of the bill or bills). If you don’t know if it is a surprise bill, contact the Department of Financial Services at 1 800 342 3736. A surprise bill is when: 1. You received services from a non participating physician at a participating hospital or ambulatory surgical center, where a participating physician was not available; or a non participating physician provided services without your knowledge; or unforeseen medical circumstances arose at the time the services were provided. You did not choose to receive services from a non participating physician instead of from an available participating physician; OR 2. You were referred by a participating physician to a non participating provider, but you did not sign a written consent that you knew the services would be out of network and would result in costs not covered by your insurer. A referral occurs: (1) during a visit with your participating physician, a non participating provider treats you; or (2) your participating physician takes a specimen from you in the office and sends it to a non participating laboratory or pathologist; or (3) for any other health care services when referrals are required under your plan. ___________________________________________________________________________________ I assign my rights to payment to my provider and I certify to the best of my knowledge that: I (or my dependent) received a surprise bill from a health care provider. I want the provider to seek payment for this bill from my insurance company (this is an “assignment”). I want my health insurer to pay the provider for any health care services I or my dependent received that are covered under my health insurance. With my assignment, the provider cannot seek payment from me, except for any copayment, coinsurance or deductible that would be owed if I or my dependent used a participating provider. If my insurer paid me for the services, I agree to send the payment to the provider.

Health Care ProxyAppointing Your Health Care Agentin New York StateThe New York Health Care Proxy Law allows you to appoint someone you trust — for example, a family member or close friend to make health care decisions for you if you lose the ability to make decisions yourself. By appointing a health care agent, you can make sure that health care providers follow your wishes. Your agent can also decide how your wishes apply as your medical condition changes. Hospitals, doctors and other health care providers must follow your agent’s decisions as if they were your own. You may give the person you select as your health care agent as little or as much authority as you want. You may allow your agent to make all health care decisions or only certain ones. You may also give your agent instructions that he or she has to follow. This form can also be used to document your wishes or instructions with regard to organ, eye and/or tissue donation.About the Health Care Proxy Form This is an important legal document. Before signing, you should understand the following facts:1.This form gives the person you choose as your agent the authority to make all health care decisions for you, including the decision to remove or provide life sustaining treatment, unless you say otherwise in this form. “Health care” means any treatment, service or procedure to diagnose or treat your physical or mental condition. 2. Unless your agent reasonably knows your wishes about artificial nutrition and hydration (nourishment and water provided by a feeding tube or intravenous line), he or she will not be allowed to refuse or consent to those measures for you.3. Your agent will start making decisions for you when your doctor determines that you are not able to make health care decisions for yourself.4. You may write on this form examples of the types of treatments that you would not desire and/or those treatments that you want to make sure you receive. The instructions may be used to limit the decision making power of the agent. Your agent must follow your instructions when making decisions for you.5. You do not need a lawyer to fill out this form.6. You may choose any adult (18 years of age or older), including a family member or close friend, to be your agent. If you select a doctor as your agent, he or she will have to choose between acting as your agent or as your attending doctor because a doctor cannot do both at the same time. Also, if you are a patient or resident of a hospital, nursing home or mental hygiene facility, there are special restrictions about naming someone who works for that facility as your agent. Ask staff at the facility to explain those restrictions.7.Before appointing someone as your health care agent, discuss it with him or her to make sure that he or she is willing to act as your agent. Tell the person you choose that he or she will be your health care agent. Discuss your health care wishes and this form with your agent. Be sure to give him or her a signed copy. Your agent cannot be sued for health care decisions made in good faith.8. If you have named your spouse as your health care agent and you later become divorced or legally separated, your former spouse can no longer be your agent by law, unless you state otherwise. If you would like your former spouse to remain your agent, you may note this on your current form and date it or complete a new form naming your former spouse.9. Even though you have signed this form, you have the right to make health care decisions for yourself as long as you are able to do so, and treatment cannot be given to you or stopped if you object, nor will your agent have any power to object.10. You may cancel the authority given to your agent by telling him or her or your health care provider orally or in writing.11. Appointing a health care agent is voluntary. No one can require you to appoint one.12. You may express your wishes or instructions regarding organ, eye and/or tissue donation on this form.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhy should I choose a health care agent?If you become unable, even temporarily, to make health care decisions, someone else must decide for you. Health care providers often look to family members for guidance. Family members may express what they think your wishes are related to a particular treatment. Appointing an agent lets you control your medical treatment by: • allowing your agent to make health care decisions on your behalf as you would want them decided; • choosing one person to make health care decisions because you think that person would make the best decisions;• choosing one person to avoid conflict or confusion among family members and/or significant others.You may also appoint an alternate agent to take over if your first choice cannot make decisions for you.Who can be a health care agent?Anyone 18 years of age or older can be a health care agent. The person you are appointing as your agent or your alternate agent cannot sign as a witness on your Health Care Proxy form.How do I appoint a health care agent? All competent adults, 18 years of age or older, can appoint a health care agent by signing a form called a Health Care Proxy. You don’t need a lawyer or a notary, just two adult witnesses. Your agent cannot sign as a witness. You can use the form printed here, but you don’t have to use this form.When would my health care agent begin to make health care decisions for me?Your health care agent would begin to make health care decisions after your doctor decides that you are not able to make your own health care decisions. As long as you are able to make health care decisions for yourself, you will have the right to do so.What decisions can my health care agent make?Unless you limit your health care agent’s authority, your agent will be able to make any health care decision that you could have made if you were able to decide for yourself. Your agent can agree that you should receive treatment, choose among different treatments and decide that treatments should not be provided, in accordance with your wishes and interests. However, your agent can only make decisions about artificial nutrition and hydration (nourishment and water provided by feeding tube or intravenous line) if he or she knows your wishes from what you have said or what you have written. The Health Care Proxy form does not give your agent the power to make non health care decisions for you, such as financial decisions.Why do I need to appoint a health care agent if I’m young and healthy?Appointing a health care agent is a good idea even though you are not elderly or terminally ill. A health care agent can act on your behalf if you become even temporarily unable to make your own health care decisions (such as might occur if you are under general anesthesia or have become comatose because of an accident). When you again become able to make your own health care decisions, your health care agent will no longer be authorized to act.How will my health care agent make decisions?Your agent must follow your wishes, as well as your moral and religious beliefs. You may write instructions on your Health Care Proxy form or simply discuss them with your agent.Frequently Asked Questions, continuedHow will my health care agent know my wishes?Having an open and frank discussion about your wishes with your health care agent will put him or her in a better position to serve your interests. If your agent does not know your wishes or beliefs, your agent is legally required to act in your best interest. Because this is a major responsibility for the person you appoint as your health care agent, you should have a discussion with the person about what types of treatments you would or would not want under different types of circumstances, such as:• whether you would want life support initiated/continued/removed if you are in a permanent coma;• whether you would want treatments initiated/continued/removed if you have a terminal illness;• whether you would want artificial nutrition and hydration initiated/withheld or continued or withdrawn and under what types of circumstances.Can my health care agent overrule my wishes or prior treatment instructions?No. Your agent is obligated to make decisions based on your wishes. If you clearly expressed particular wishes, or gave particular treatment instructions, your agent has a duty to follow those wishes or instructions unless he or she has a good faith basis for believing that your wishes changed or do not apply to the circumstances.Who will pay attention to my agent?All hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and other health care providers are legally required to provide your health care agent with the same information that would be provided to you and to honor the decisions by your agent as if they were made by you. If a hospital or nursing home objects to some treatment options (such as removing certain treatment) they must tell you or your agent BEFORE or upon admission, if reasonably possible.What if my health care agent is not available when decisions must be made?You may appoint an alternate agent to decide for you if your health care agent is unavailable, unable or unwilling to act when decisions must be made. Otherwise, health care providers will make health care decisions for you that follow instructions you gave while you were still able to do so. Any instructions that you write on your Health Care Proxy form will guide health care providers under these circumstances.What if I change my mind?It is easy to cancel your Health Care Proxy, to change the person you have chosen as your health care agent or to change any instructions or limitations you have included on the form. Simply fill out a new form. In addition, you may indicate that your Health Care Proxy expires on a specified date or if certain events occur. Otherwise, the Health Care Proxy will be valid indefinitely. If you choose your spouse as your health care agent or as your alternate, and you get divorced or legally separated, the appointment is automatically cancelled. However, if you would like your former spouse to remain your agent, you may note this on your current form and date it or complete a new form naming your former spouse.Can my health care agent be legally liable for decisions made on my behalf?No. Your health care agent will not be liable for health care decisions made in good faith on your behalf. Also, he or she cannot be held liable for costs of your care, just because he or she is your agent.Is a Health Care Proxy the same as a living will?No. A living will is a document that provides specific instructions about health care decisions. You may put such instructions on your Health Care Proxy form. The Health Care Proxy allows you to choose someone you trust to make health care decisions on your behalf. Unlike a living will, a Health Care Proxy does not require that you decide in advance decisions that may arise. Instead, your health care agent can interpret your wishes as medical circumstances change and can make decisions you could not have known would have to be made.Where should I keep my Health Care Proxy form after it is signed?Give a copy to your agent, your doctor, your attorney and any other family members or close friends you want. Keep a copy in your wallet or purse or with other important papers, but not in a location where no one can access it, like a safe deposit box. Bring a copy if you are admitted to the hospital, even for minor surgery, or if you undergo outpatient surgery.May I use the Health Care Proxy form to express my wishes about organ, eye and/or tissue donation?Yes. Use the optional organ, eye and/or tissue donation section on the Health Care Proxy form and be sure to have the section witnessed by two people. You may specify that your organs, eyes and/or tissues be used for transplantation, research or educational purposes. Any limitation(s) associated with your wishes should be noted in this section of the proxy. Failure to include your wishes and instructions on your Health Care Proxy form will not be taken to mean that you do not want to be an organ, eye and/or tissue donor.Can my health care agent make decisions for me about organ, eye and/or tissue donation?Yes. As of August 26, 2009, your health care agent is authorized to make decisions after your death, but only those regarding organ, eye and/or tissue donation. Your health care agent must make such decisions as noted on your Health Care Proxy form.Who can consent to a donation if I choose not to state my wishes at this time?It is important to note your wishes about organ, eye and/or tissue donation to your health care agent, or “health care proxy,” family members, and the person responsible for disposition of your remains. If you have not already made your wishes to become, or not to become, an organ and/or tissue donor known, New York Law provides a list of individuals who are authorized to consent to organ, eye and/or tissue donation on your behalf. They are listed as follows, in order of priority: your health care agent/proxy; your spouse, if you are not legally separated, or your domestic partner; a son or daughter 18 years of age or older; either of your parents; a brother or sister 18 years of age or older; an adult grandchild; a grandparent; a guardian appointed for you by a court prior to your death; or any other person authorized to dispose of your body.Frequently Asked Questions, continuedHealth Care Proxy Form Instructions Item (1)Write the name, home address and telephone number of the person you are selecting as your agent.Item (2)If you want to appoint an alternate agent, write the name, home address and telephone number of the person you are selecting as your alternate agent.Item (3)Your Health Care Proxy will remain valid indefinitely unless you set an expiration date or condition for its expiration.

We strive to be a place where our exceptionally talented faculty, staff and students of all identities can thrive. We believe that a multifaceted community of people working together in a coordinated way, across our tripartite mission, is key to addressing healthcare and health inequities in the communities that we serve. Together, we will use our diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives to excel in innovation and problem solving as we seek to achieve and even redefine excellence. We intentionally foster a learning and work environment of inclusivity, belonging, and respect for all by relying on our pillars: ● Optimizing organizational culture ● Promoting inclusive community ● Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion capacity ● Developing and implementing equity related knowledge For more details about how we elevate diversity, equity, and inclusion internally and in our community, please contact: NYU Langone Health Gbenga Ogedegbe, MD, MPH, Director, Institute for Excellence in Health Equity NYU Langone Health John Ross (JR) Rizzo, MD, MSCI, FACRM, Health System Director, Disability Inclusion NYU Langone Health Molree Williams Lendor, JD, LMSW, Assistant Vice President, NYU Langone Academy and Workplace Culture & Inclusion NYU Grossman School of Medicine Joseph Ravenell, MD, Associate Dean of Diversity and Inclusion NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine Sandy Dorcelus, DO, FACOG, Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Office of Science and Research Marie Bragg, PhD, Director of Diversity Initiatives


2024 NYU PO TCs.docx Page 1 Rev. 1 10 24 PURCHASE ORDER TERMS AND CONDITIONS The Purchase Order issued to the “Seller”, as specified on the Purchase Order, by NYU Langone Hospitals (“NYULH”), NYU Grossman School of Medicine (“NYUGSOM”), NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine (“NYU GLISOM”), NYU Langone Health System (the “System”), or any entity controlled by any of them, as the case may be, (any of which being “Buyer”, as specified on the Purchase Order) and these Terms and Conditions (collectively, the “Purchase Order” or “Order”) are the exclusive terms and conditions with respect to the purchase and sale of goods, materials and equipment (“Goods”) and/or of labor or services (“Services”) specified in the Purchase Order. 1. Contract; Acceptance; Order of Precedence. Buyer shall not be bound by the Purchase Order until it is accepted by Seller, which shall be deemed to occur on the earlier of the following: (a) Seller does not object in writing to any of term or provision within two (2) business days after issuance of the Purchase Order, or (b) Seller commences performance of the Purchase Order. Upon acceptance, the Purchase Order shall constitute a binding contract between Buyer and Seller. The Purchase Order contains the complete and final agreement between Buyer and Seller and supersedes and replaces any and all prior discussions and agreements between Buyer and Seller. No additional or different terms, whether printed or otherwise, in Seller’s quotation, document or any other communication from Seller to Buyer (including the provisions of any click wrap agreement, or similar form of agreement which may have been affirmatively accepted by Buyer’s authorized users) shall be binding on Buyer unless specifically agreed to in writing by an authorized representative from Buyer’s Supply Chain Management Department. No acceptance shall be effective which varies the terms of the Purchase Order or proposes additional terms. Any such proposals are deemed rejected. 2. Changes. Buyer may from time to time by written notice to Seller make changes in specifications, design, delivery schedules (postponements only), testing, packing or designation. If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost and/or time required for performance, an equitable adjustment shall be made and the Purchase Order modified accordingly. Price increases or extensions of time for delivery shall not be binding on Buyer unless approved by Buyer. 3. Termination. Buyer, in its sole discretion and with or without cause, may cancel the Purchase Order, in whole or in part, at any time upon notice to Seller without incurring liability to Seller for lost or anticipated profits, or any other costs or damages, other than the proportionate value of the purchase price for the Goods and/or Services performed or delivered prior to the effective date of termination. In addition to any other remedy provided herein, at law or equity, Buyer shall have the right to terminate or cancel an Order, and any obligation to purchase a product or service by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Seller, in the event Seller: (a) fails to comply with any condition of the Order or any related agreement, and such failure is not remedied within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof has been given to Seller; (b) becomes insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, suffers or permits the appointment of a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or similar officer for all or parts of its business or assets; or (c) avails itself of or becomes subject to any bankruptcy proceeding under the laws or any jurisdiction relating to insolvency or the protection of rights of creditors. Upon receipt of a notice of termination, unless instructed otherwise by Buyer, Seller shall stop all work as directed in the notice, including placing further orders for materials, services, subcontracts, except as necessary to continue performance under any other terms of the Order (if not affected by the termination notice). Unless Buyer has requested and received a refund in respect of any undelivered product(s) or terminated Services, it shall be entitled to the delivery of all Goods and completion of all Services for which it has paid prior to the effective date of the termination. To the extent the Purchase Order covers stock Goods, Buyer’s only obligation is to pay for Goods accepted by Buyer prior to such termination. To the extent the Purchase Order covers Goods manufactured or fabricated to Buyer’s specifications, Seller shall immediately cease all performance upon receipt of the notice of termination and any claim of Seller shall be settled on the basis of reasonable costs it has incurred in the performance of the Order. 4. Essential Term; Performance Delays; Force Majeure. (a) Time is of the essence in Seller’s performance of the Purchase Order. If Goods are not delivered or Services rendered within the time periods specified in the Purchase Order, Buyer may without any liability, agree on a new delivery date in writing or terminate all of part of the Purchase Order and/or relevant agreement for the then remaining balance thereof by notice effective upon receipt by Seller, or purchase substitute Goods or Services elsewhere and charge Seller with any loss incurred. Seller shall refund Buyer any deposit and any prepaid and unused amounts paid by Buyer for all the Goods and/or Services covered by the terminated Purchase Order and/or relevant agreement. (b) A Force Majeure event shall not constitute default hereunder. The term “Force Majeure” shall mean any unforeseen event affecting a party’s performance without such party’s fault or negligence and which is due to causes beyond such party’s control, including, without limitation, acts of God or of public enemy, any act of government, court orders, shelter in place orders, fires, hurricane, earthquake, floods, freight embargoes, unusually severe weather, riots, civil commotion, war, insurrection, typhoon, pandemic, tidal wave, plague, quarantine, epidemic, or any act of terrorism. The party affected by the Force Majeure shall provide the other party with written notice of a delay and cause thereof and use its best efforts to continue or resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Force Majeure affects either party or both and lasts for more 2024 NYU PO TCs.docx Page 2 Rev. 1 10 24 than ten (10) days, Buyer may in its discretion, upon notice to Seller, (i) extend the time for performance of the Services or any obligations by at least a period of time equal to the duration of the Force Majeure or (ii) terminate all or part of the Purchase Order and/or the relevant agreement (effective upon Seller’s receipt of the notice), without being held in breach and, in case of Seller’s Force Majeure, source the relevant Goods and/or Services from another third party. In the event of termination under this section, Seller shall refund Buyer any deposit and any prepaid and unused amounts paid by Buyer for all the Good and/or Services covered by the terminated Purchase Order and/or relevant agreement (if any). 5. Inspection and Rejection. Payment for Goods and/or Services shall not constitute acceptance thereof. All Goods are subject to Buyer’s inspection, at the source if deemed necessary by Buyer. Final inspection shall be at Buyer’s premises unless otherwise agreed in writing. If any of the Goods and/or Services are found at any time to be defective in material or workmanship or otherwise not in conformity with the requirements of an Order, including any drawings and specifications, Buyer shall have the right, in addition to any other rights which Buyer may have under warranties or otherwise, to reject and return such goods at Seller’s expense, and such goods shall not be replaced without written authorization from Buyer. Supplies in excess of quantities ordered may be returned to Seller at its expense. Failure by Buyer to inspect and/or test the Goods shall not be deemed acceptance by Buyer. Buyer’s remedies herein reserved shall be cumulative and additional to any other or further remedies provided in law or equity. 6. Shipment; Risk of Loss. Goods shall be packed and shipped by Seller in accordance with Buyer’s instructions and good commercial practice. Seller shall indicate on each package shipped, including drop ships packages, and on the packing slip the applicable Buyer’s Purchase Order Number, with each packing slip listing the contents on the package. If Goods are not shipped in accordance with Buyer’s direction and the instructions set forth in the Purchase Order, Seller shall grant to Buyer the right to setoff for any excess cost incurred by Buyer as a result. Shipments must be labeled appropriately for handling of fragile, electrical, chemicals, temperature sensitive, perishable, biological, radioactive or otherwise hazardous equipment or materials as required by applicable laws. Seller shall pay all related freight costs. Seller shall bear all risk of loss of or damage until the Goods are delivered as specified in the Order, inspected (without being rejected) by Buyer, and, where applicable, assembled, calibrated and/or installed by Seller. 7. Pricing. Buyer will pay Seller only for the Goods and Services and at such prices as stated in the Purchase Order. No charge for packing, insurance, handling costs or transportation will be allowed except as stated in the Purchase Order. Prices charged Buyer will not exceed Seller's lowest price and sale terms relating thereto will not be less favorable than those, in effect at the date of shipment or performance for Goods of substantially same kind, except as otherwise agreed in writing by Buyer. In the event Buyer becomes entitled to such lower prices, but has already made payment at the higher price, Seller shall promptly refund the difference in price to Buyer. Discount terms begin with the receipt of the invoice or the Goods, whichever is later. Buyer may withhold charges that are under dispute until the matter is resolved. In the event Seller requests a change to its bank account information for payments, Buyer may delay payment for any invoice up to forty five (45) days to allow Buyer to validate the bank account information prior to the disbursement of payment. During such time Seller shall not suspend its services nor put Buyer on credit hold. If the Purchase Order involves drugs or other pharmaceutical products, Seller acknowledges that federal law constrains the prices that may be charged by suppliers for Medicaid reimbursement under 42 U.S.C. §1396r 8 or any successor statute. 8. Warranties. In addition to this and other warranties which may be prescribed by law, Seller warrants that the Goods to be delivered pursuant to the Purchase Order: (a) will at all times conform to the specifications, drawings, samples or other descriptions, oral or written, furnished to or specified by Buyer; (b) will be merchantable, of good quality, material and workmanship and free from defects of design, material or workmanship; (c) will be fit for the purposes for which intended; (d) do not infringe or misappropriate the rights of any third party or violate any law; and (e) were not produced, manufactured, priced or sold in violation of any law, including, without limitation, the Fair Labor Standards Act.

All warranties, both express and implied, will survive delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. In addition, Seller warrants that Seller has free, clear title to any and all Goods, free of all liens, security interests and encumbrances. Upon Buyer’s notice, Seller, at its own expense, shall promptly replace or correct defects of any goods or services not conforming to the foregoing warranty. If Seller fails to promptly correct defects or replace non conforming goods or services, Buyer may, upon notice to Seller, make such corrections at Seller's expense or cancel the Order and/or the then remaining balance without any penalty or damages. 9. Manufacturer Warranty. Seller agrees that all warranties and representations made by the manufacturer are intended to be and shall pass through to Buyer. Seller shall take all necessary steps to ensure that such warranties and representations flow through, to and for the benefit of Buyer, and that the effective date of such warranties starts the first day of use. Seller further represents that it has not and will not enter into any agreements with the manufacturer providing that the sale or use of Goods as contemplated by the Purchase Order shall in any way limit, negate or nullify such manufacturer’s warranty. 10. Proprietary Rights. To the extent not automatically vested in Buyer, Seller hereby assigns to Buyer ownership of all Goods to be provided hereunder. In addition, unless otherwise specifically agreed in the Purchase Order, works to be created and/or developed and produced for Buyer and any documentation or other products and/or results of the Services to be rendered by Seller (including any associated invention, improvement, discovery or innovation made, conceived or actually reduced to practice by Seller as a result of performing the Services) (the “Work”) shall be deemed “work made for hire” as that phrase is understood under 2024 NYU PO TCs.docx Page 3 Rev. 1 10 24 the copyright laws of the United States and shall be owned exclusively by Buyer, including all copyright, patent and other proprietary and intellectual property rights therein, and such rights are hereby conveyed to Buyer. Seller agrees that its assigns, agents, successors, and representatives will not have the right to make any claims in any way or with regard to any aspect of, the Work. Should the Work not be considered “work made for hire” under applicable law, Seller hereby sells, assigns, and transfers to Buyer, its successors and assigns, its right, title and interest in the Work, and any related registrations and copyright applications, and any renewals and extensions thereof, and in and to all works based upon, derived from, or incorporating the Work, and, in and to all income, royalties, damages, claims and payments now or hereafter due or payable with respect thereto, and in and to all causes of action, either in law or in equity for past, present, or future infringement based on the copyrights, and in and to all corresponding rights throughout the world. Seller agrees to execute all documents and to perform such other acts as Buyer may deem necessary to secure for it or its designee the rights herein assigned. In addition, if the Services performed by Seller result in an invention, improvement, discovery or innovation, Seller shall promptly disclose the same to Buyer in writing. Such invention, improvement, discovery or innovation and any resulting patent rights shall become the exclusive property of Buyer, and Buyer shall be the sole party entitled to the rights, title and interest in and to the invention. At Buyer’s request, Seller shall promptly deliver, execute, file and record all documentation evidencing such assignment. 11. Record Retention and Access. In the event the Purchase Order involves or relates to (a) the provision of services under Medicare and (b) Goods or Services exceeding the aggregate purchase price of $10,000 during any 12 month period, Seller shall, in accordance with Section 952 of the Omnibus Reconciliation Action of 1980 and all amendments thereto, make available to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Comptroller General and their representatives (“HHS”) the Purchase Order and all other books, documents and records of Seller as are necessary to certify the nature and extent of the costs incurred by Buyer for at least four (4) years after Seller furnishes the Goods or Services specified in the Order. In addition, this provision will be contained in any agreement between Seller and any subcontractor of Goods or Services under the Purchase Order. Seller will give Buyer notice of any request made directly by HHS upon Seller. 12. Insurance. Seller will procure and maintain the following types and amounts of insurance coverage: (a) commercial general liability insurance, written on an occurrence basis in amounts of not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence/$4,000,000 in the annual aggregate, including coverage for contractual liability, products and completed operations, personal injury, bodily injury, broad form property and damage endorsements, and if applicable, liquor liability endorsements if the Purchase Order includes service of alcohol; (b) if Seller provides goods or services in which Seller accesses NYU Langone Health’s information technology networks or systems for any reasons, cyber insurance with a minimum of $5,000,000; (c) if the Purchase Order requires Seller to be on site at Buyer’s facilities, (i) statutory worker’s compensation insurance and employer’s liability insurance in amounts of not less than $1,000,000 for each accident (unless Seller is a sole proprietorship, in which event such insurance shall not be required), and (ii) automobile liability insurance covering all owned, non owned and hired vehicles for not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence; and (d) professional liability (errors and omissions) insurance with limits of not less than $2,000,000 if the Purchase Order covers the provision of professional services.

The policies shall provide that Buyer is not responsible for payment of premium for additional insured status. To the extent permitted by applicable law, such coverage shall: (A) be primary and non contributory to any other insurance carried by Buyer; (B) contain standard cross liability provisions as to separation of insureds; and (C) not require contribution before any excess or umbrella liability coverage will apply. All insurance policies specified herein will be issued by insurers with a minimum rating from A.M. Best of A , and a minimum financial rating of VII. If any required insurance is covered by a claims made policy, Seller will either maintain the policy for at least three (3) years following completion of performance of the Purchase Order or purchase tail coverage for the remaining period. Seller will endeavor to give Buyer at least thirty (30) days’ notice of cancellation or any material change to such insurance. If the Purchase Order is issued by Buyer’s Real Estate Development & Facilities (RED+F), each year Seller will be required to submit a renewal certificate evidencing the required insurance coverage. Seller will receive a request from a third party vendor on behalf of NYULH for a renewal certificate with instructions on how to submit the updated information. Where work is to be performed in a property not owned by the Buyer or one of the Buyer’s affiliates, the Seller shall obtain a copy of and fully comply with the property owner’s insurance requirements and name the property owner and others as specified by the property owner as additional insureds in connection with the performance of the Purchase Order. 13. Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Seller will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Buyer, its affiliated entities, trustees, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (each, an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all inter party and/or third party losses, claims, allegations, demands, suits, proceedings, investigations, prosecutions, actions, causes of action, liabilities, obligations, costs, expenses, assessments, settlements, judgments, interest and penalties (including legal expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees), damages or injuries of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, damage, loss or destruction of real or personal property, personal or bodily injury or death to Buyer and all other persons) caused by, resulting from, arising out of, occurring in connection with, or relating to, directly or indirectly to, (a) any act 2024 NYU PO TCs.docx Page 4 Rev. 1 10 24 or omission of Seller, its employees, subcontractors, agents or representatives, in the performance of the Purchase Order, (b) the allegation that the Goods or Services provided by Seller or Buyer’s use thereof infringes or misappropriates the copyright, patent or other proprietary or intellectual property right of any third party, or that Seller has violated any applicable law or its agreements with any third party, (c) any breach or alleged breach of any provision of the Order or the Terms and Conditions of the Purchase Order, including a breach of any representations or warranties of Seller made herein, and (d) a claim, that the Goods or Services provided by Seller are defective or that Seller failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Buyer will notify Seller in writing of a claim for indemnification and at Seller’s request shall give Seller control of the defense of such suit, insofar as Buyer has the authority to do so, and information and assistance for the same, all at Seller’s expense. In the event Seller fails to prosecute and conduct the defense diligently and in good faith, Buyer may take any and all actions at Seller’s expense that it deems necessary or desirable to preserve its rights with respect to such claim, including the right (but not the obligation) to engage counsel and defend, compromise or settle such claim, without waiving or otherwise limiting its rights under this section. Seller will consult with Buyer and at all times keep Buyer informed of all material matters relating to its indemnification of Buyer, including compromise or settlement of any claim. Buyer will be entitled to participate in any litigation and/or negotiation relating to any compromise or settlement with counsel of its own choice. Seller will not agree to any compromise or settlement of any third party claim, or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment in respect of such claim, without Buyer’s prior written consent. For purposes of this section, “Seller” means each of Seller and any subcontractor engaged by Seller in connection with the Goods and Services, and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, servants and representatives. References to “Buyer” in this section includes NYULH, NYUGSOM, NYU GLISOM, the System, and any other entity listed as the “Buyer” on the Purchase Order. The provisions of this section will survive termination of the Purchase Order. 14.
