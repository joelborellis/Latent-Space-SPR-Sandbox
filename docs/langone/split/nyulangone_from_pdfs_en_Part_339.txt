The REASON FOR ENTRY section should state the work to be completed in the PRCS (e.g., welding). SECTION 2 Permit Space Hazards The entry supervisor will examine the PRCS for potential hazards and will complete Section 2 of the Permit. EH&S, or the NYULH LI Sr. Director of Engineering, or an authorized consultant shall be contacted for assistance in identifying potential hazards. SECTION 3 Hazard Elimination The entry supervisor, along with other applicable personnel, shall eliminate the feasible hazards and complete Section 3 of the Permit. Examples of hazard elimination include: Lockout/Tagout OSHA compliant lockout/tagout procedures should be followed. If there is no equipment requiring lockout/tagout N/A should be checked. Equipment purging and cleaning The PRCS should be purged of its contents and cleaned if necessary to protect workers who will enter it. If the PRCS contained chemicals, or chemicals are used to clean it, EH&S or NYULH LI Hospitality Services, as applicable, should be contacted for disposal of these chemicals, cleaning solution, and any rinse water that may contain chemical contaminants. If no cleaning is necessary, N/A should be checked. If the equipment cannot be cleaned, EH&S or the NYULH LI Sr. Director of Engineering, as applicable, should be contacted for any special procedures that may be necessary. All lines disconnected, blanked or plugged All pipelines that are connected to a PRCS must be disconnected, blanked or plugged so that no contaminants will enter the PRCS during entry. Where the pipeline cannot be completely isolated (e.g., sewers), it shall be isolated to the extent possible to reduce contaminants and sudden flooding. Safety Policy 138, Appendix B Instructions for Preparing a PRCS for Entry And Completing the Permit Revised: November 21, 2019 Ventilation Continuous forced air ventilation is necessary where the atmosphere in a PRCS does not meet acceptable levels for oxygen and air contaminants. All ventilation equipment must be explosion proof and draw in fresh air at standard temperature and pressure. Where forced air ventilation does not maintain an acceptable atmosphere, the use of air purifying or supplied air respirators is necessary, which requires involvement of EH&S or an authorized consultant. Barriers A barrier shall be installed to prevent anyone from falling into the PRCS and to keep pedestrians away from it. SECTION 4 and 5 Personal Protective and Safety Equipment Based on an assessment of the hazards in the PRCS, workers must be supplied with the necessary personal protective and safety equipment. Lighting should be provided to illuminate the work area inside the PRCS. All lighting must be explosion proof. The attendant and entrant(s) should be provided with radios to communicate during the operation. Other Equipment that may be necessary The entry supervisor should check on the Permit any other equipment that the workers may need to enter the PRCS. This may include, but is not limited to, the equipment listed in Sections 4 and 5 of the Permit SECTION 6 Atmospheric Monitoring Personnel shall use a recently calibrated continuous air monitor to do a pre entry atmospheric check in the PRCS for oxygen deficiency, lower explosive limit (L.E.L.), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The percent oxygen should be 19.5 23.. The L.E.L. should be less than . For CO, H2S, and other air contaminants, contact EH&S or the authorized consultant to determine the levels not to be exceeded. Additional tests for toxicity shall be done for chemical present within, or introduced into the PRCS. The person conducting the test will sign next to the results for the pre entry Safety Policy 138, Appendix B Instructions for Preparing a PRCS for Entry And Completing the Permit Revised: November 21, 2019 atmospheric checks when the levels are within the prescribed limits. Atmospheric monitoring shall be conducted continuously during entry and recorded every 30 minutes during the entry. If any of these test results are not in the prescribed range, forced fresh air ventilation into the PRCS shall be used until the required levels are met. SECTION 7 Communication Procedures The entry supervisor should determine the most effective way for the authorized entrant(s) and the attendant to stay in contact. This may include, but is not limited to, voice or visual communication or two way radio communication. Cell phones shall not be used for communication within a PRCS. SECTION 8 Personnel The entry supervisor will list the authorized entrant(s) that will enter the PRCS. The entry supervisor will also write the name of the attendant that will be monitoring the entrants inside the PRCS, informing the entrants of any change in the continuous air monitor, and using the radio for keeping the entry supervisor informed or for calling for rescue. The entry supervisor should review the Permit and procedures to be used in the PRCS with the entrant(s) and attendant. The entry supervisor will sign the permit and contact the manager for authorization to enter the PRCS. The manager will sign and enter the date and time on the Permit. During the work, the entry supervisor will ensure the Permit is readily available at the PRCS. After the work is done or the Permit is no longer valid, it is returned to the Facilities office or TC. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES In the event of a PRCS emergency, the attendant shall contact the entry supervisor and request assistance. The attendant shall attempt non entry rescue utilizing the retrieval system. The attendant shall not try to enter a PRCS to assist a downed worker. If other workers are in the area of the PRCS, their assistance should be requested. If the entrant is not able to leave the PRCS and a qualified rescue vendor is not present to perform an entry rescue, the entry supervisor shall call 911 and inform the operator that a confined space rescue is required. The entry supervisor shall then contact NYULH Telecommunications (212.263.911). Responding NYULH employees should assist in non entry rescue, but should not attempt to enter the PRCS. Safety Policy 138, Appendix B Instructions for Preparing a PRCS for Entry And Completing the Permit Revised: November 21, 2019 POST PRCS ENTRY PROCEDURES After the PRCS entry work is completed, the space should be returned to its original condition in accordance with Facilities’ or the building manager’s procedures. All lines should be reconnected, unblanked, or unplugged. The Facilities’ manager, TC or controlling contractor’s competent person should check and authorize the PRCS to be put back into service. All personal protective and safety equipment that was used in the PRCS entry should be cleaned and returned to storage for future use. If disposable personal protective equipment was used and contaminated with chemicals, it should be placed in a container and given to EH&S for proper disposal (as per Safety Policy No. 108a, Hazardous Waste from Contractors (Construction and Building Maintenance). If necessary, showers should be provided for workers after the PRCS entry operation is completed.
