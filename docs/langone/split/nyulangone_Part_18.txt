Learn more about Sala Institute Support Sala Institute Stephen E. Banner Fund for Lung Cancer Research Driving breakthroughs in lung cancer research. For almost three decades, Ellen Banner and her family have supported NYU Langone’s quest to develop innovative lung cancer treatments and provide people with lung cancer with the most comprehensive, compassionate care. Because of the Banner family and the community they have cultivated around their passion for lung cancer research, NYU Langone has made tremendous strides. Meeting the evolving needs of patients The Stephen E. Banner Fund for Lung Cancer Research positions NYU Langone scientists and doctors at the forefront of lung cancer investigations and gives our staff the ability to offer state-of-the-art care and social work, counseling, and advocacy resources to lung cancer patients and their families. About Stephen E. Banner Stephen E. Banner is lovingly remembered as a devoted husband and father to his four children, a loyal and generous friend, and a brilliant lawyer. An honors graduate of Yale College and Harvard Law School, Steve clerked for Judge Irving R. Kaufman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit before moving on to success in the corporate department at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. In 1991, he became a senior executive at the Seagram Company, one of his longtime clients. Renowned among his colleagues for his incisive intellect, quick wit, and personal charisma, Steve was also the kind of man who would go out of his way to help mentor young associates or write silly rhymed verse for his friends’ birthdays. Never happier than when he was with his wife and children, he tended to downplay his own considerable professional accomplishments in favor of his kids’ triumphs. His warmth and joie de vivre still inspire all who knew him. The Stephen E. Banner Professorship in Thoracic Oncology This endowed professorship funds the work of surgeon-scientist Harvey Pass, MD, as he seeks new ideas in lung cancer research and educates the next generation of leading physicians in the field. A Letter from Ellen Banner Dear Friends, More than 25 years ago, my family and I established the Stephen E. Banner Fund for Lung Cancer Research in loving memory of my husband, Steve. Over the years, the Banner Fund has galvanized NYU Langone’s efforts to ultimately eradicate lung cancer while easing its burden on patients today. Since its inception, the Banner Fund—along with the Stephen E. Banner Professorship in Thoracic Oncology—has allowed us to raise over $10 million to foster the pioneering investigations of Harvey Pass, MD, who currently holds the professorship, Abraham Chachoua, MD, and their colleagues at the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center. With help from the Banner Fund, NYU Langone can fulfill its commitment to discovery and innovation, and provide crucial support for educational and wellness services for patients and families. One of our most recent accomplishments is a new series of videos designed to help individuals and their loved ones cope with the disease and the treatment process. Understanding Lung Cancer captures the compassion, enthusiasm, and unwavering dedication of the lung cancer team and reflects the gratitude of individuals who have received superb care. The doctors and staff at NYU Langone work tirelessly to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients, and the Banner Fund serves as a vital resource.

Gulmi View All 71 Doctors & 71 New Chief of Surgical Oncology Named by NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island Robotic Surgery Offers Advanced Approach to Cardiac Tumors Robots Lend a Hand (or Four) in Brooklyn Operating Room Advanced Diagnostics & Robotic Surgery Treat Prostate Cancer Robotic surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery during which doctors use very small surgical instruments that fit into a patient’s body through a series of tiny incisions. These instruments are mounted on three robotic arms, allowing a surgeon maximum range and precision of motion as he or she performs the procedure. A fourth arm holds a high-definition, three-dimensional camera that enhances visualization—magnifying the tissue and structures of the body tenfold—and guides the surgeon during the procedure. NYU Langone surgeons control their instruments and camera at a console in the operating room. Using finger and foot controls, they operate all four arms of the robot while looking through a stereoscopic, high-definition monitor. The robot translates the surgeon’s hand, wrist, and finger movements to guide each instrument in real-time, after scaling each movement down to size. For example, a one-inch movement may be scaled down to a quarter-inch, allowing extraordinary surgical precision and operative control. Potential Benefits of Robotic Surgery Because robotic surgery requires very small incisions, appropriately selected patients can benefit from less surgical trauma, minimal scarring, and faster recovery times than with traditional open surgery. Our surgical systems, the da Vinci Si—and our latest surgical robot, the da Vinci Xi—offer key features to improve the safety and effectiveness of robotic surgery procedures, including the following: the system’s two high-definition cameras provide the surgeon with a magnified view of the surgical site, combing very accurate depth perception with a 40 percent sharper image than previous systems an additional arm can be used to hold a retractor or other surgical instrument, giving the surgeon more operating capability instant image referencing lets the surgeon display diagnostic images, such as ultrasound or CT scan images of the area taken prior to surgery, on the da Vinci Si/Xi® monitor, alongside the surgeon’s view of the surgery being performed enhanced near-infrared imaging can be used during surgery to distinguish abnormal tissue from normal tissue and evaluate blood flow in real time extra mobile “wrist action,” with mechanical wrists that can hold an array of specialized surgical instruments and function like a human’s, but with an even greater range of motion scalability that allows the surgeon to calibrate the robot’s arm to move a fraction of an inch for every inch the surgeon’s hand moves, a feature that simplifies the most complex movements, including delicate removals as well as suturing and knot-tying Our Robotic Technology In 2008, NYU Langone became the first medical center in New York or New Jersey with the da Vinci Si surgical robot, the world’s most advanced computer-assisted surgical system at the time. Since then, we have added six more systems to the Robotic Surgery Center and were the first New York City hospital with the latest generation robotic surgical system, the da Vinci Xi. This newest robot offers broader capabilities than prior generations of the da Vinci surgical system and allows us to perform a wider range of minimally invasive procedures. NYU Langone’s experienced and highly skilled robotic surgeons use sophisticated, minimally invasive techniques to treat people who have a range of complex cancers and tumors. The types of cancer for which we are able to use robotic surgery include cancers of the digestive and gastrointestinal tract gynecologic cancers head and neck cancers urologic cancers . Our surgeons collaborate with specialists at NYU Langone’s to determine if you require further treatment after surgery. Our Expertise in Robotic Lung Cancer Surgery Our thoracic surgeons perform several different robotic procedures in people with early stages of lung cancer, including , and posterior mediastinal tumors. We also work with select patients who have been successfully treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy and may benefit from surgery. As national leaders in a range of robotic-assisted surgeries that are used to manage several types of lung cancer, NYU Langone is one of the few institutions in the country to offer robotic lobectomies, or removal of a lobe of the lung. Our Expertise in Robotic Gynecologic Cancer Surgery Our gynecologic oncologists have vast experience in performing robotic-assisted surgery to manage gynecologic cancers, including early , fallopian tube cancer, and . Robotic surgery approaches result in faster recovery time for patients. This helps patients to return to their normal activities more quickly or begin chemotherapy or radiation treatment sooner, if it is recommended. Our surgeons use advanced techniques, such as near-infrared imaging when performing sentinel node biopsies in women who have cervical cancer, which allows them to better identify lymph nodes, remove only the most necessary lymph nodes, and reduce the short- and long-term side effects from lymph node dissection. We also play a key leadership role in the training of other surgeons to perform safe robotic surgical procedures. Our Expertise in Robotic Colorectal Cancer Surgery Our surgical oncologists and colorectal surgeons are experts in the use of robotic approaches to manage colon and rectal cancers . Their expertise in using the most advanced robotic technology enables them to remove tumors while minimizing trauma to the patient. Whenever possible, they also use nerve-sparing surgical techniques that preserve sphincter, bladder, and sexual function. Our Expertise in Robotic Urologic Cancer Surgery We have a robotic uro-oncology team that includes urologic surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and radiologists. Our specialties include: penile cancer ureteral cancer We are known internationally for our expertise in kidney-sparing surgery, known as partial nephrectomy, when treating people who have kidney cancer. We’ve also developed specialized techniques using advanced imaging to minimize trauma to the kidney during surgery. This leads to less blood loss and shorter hospital stays. Each year, more than 100 surgeons from around the world come to NYU Langone to observe our advanced robotic techniques for managing kidney cancer. We are cofounders of the largest kidney cancer database in the world and have published two landmark studies on the safety and effectiveness of robotic partial nephrectomy. The studies showed that robotic partial nephrectomy is more effective than laparoscopic surgery at managing kidney cancer. We offer fluorescence imaging for managing kidney cancer surgery, which gives us a more detailed picture of kidney blood flow and allows us to more clearly distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous tissue. Robotic surgery techniques for have advanced, allowing both total and partial removal of the bladder to be done in a minimally invasive way. This can reduce trauma, blood loss, and wound-related complications. NYU Langone was the first and currently the only institution in New York City to offer robotic bladder removal and robotic reconstruction of a new bladder. We pioneered many of the robotic-assisted surgical techniques used around the world today to treat cancers of the ureter, the tube that connects the bladder to the kidneys. Whenever possible, we focus on removing the affected ureter while preserving the kidney. Our team has also pioneered the use of robotic surgery techniques and fluorescence imaging to perform lymph node removal for advanced testis and penile cancer. These advances have dramatically reduced pain, length of hospital stay, and surgery-related complications for our patients. We use one of the world’s largest and most experienced advanced MRI imaging and biopsy programs to maximize outcomes during robotic prostate cancer surgery. Our goal is to manage the cancer while preserving sexual and urinary function. Obstetrics & Gynecology View All Locations (26) We have locations throughout New York City and Long Island.
