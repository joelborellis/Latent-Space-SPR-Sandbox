Revised: 2/2024 Faculty Group Practice Financial Policies and Acknowledgement Thank you for choosing NYU Langone Health for your healthcare. We appreciate that you have entrusted us with your medical needs and we are committed to providing you with the best service possible. Because healthcare benefits and coverage options have become increasingly complex, we have developed this financial policy to help you better understand your responsibilities as a patient. We will do our best to assist you with understanding your proposed treatment and in answering questions related to submitting your insurance claim for reimbursement. Your health insurance policy is a contract between you and your health insurance company or your employer. Please note it is your responsibility to know if your insurance has specific rules or regulations, such as the need for referrals, pre certifications, pre authorizations, limits on outpatient charges, and any requirements for specific physicians, labs and/or hospitals to use. You should be knowledgeable of any deductibles, copayments, and/or coinsurance. This applies to all payors regardless of whether or not our physicians participate. If you are uncertain about your current health insurance policy benefits you should contact your plan to learn the details about your benefits, out of pocket fees, and coverage limits. Address Change It is important that we have your correct address information on file. Please advise us anytime there is any change to your address, telephone or other contact information. Insurance Coverage Please provide us with your current insurance plan information at the time of each scheduling and/ or notify us of any changes. We will request a copy of your insurance card to keep on file. Please provide any required referrals or authorizations, in advance of your appointment or service. If you do not provide these before care is provided, you will be responsible for the cost of the care. When in doubt, contact your plan directly for clarification. Our doctors participate with many insurance plans but participation differs by provider. You can see a list of plans that our physicians participate with on our website Find a Doctor(http://nyulangone.org/doctors). Before your appointment, please contact your insurance to be sure your doctor is in network and the services are covered under your plan. You are expected to pay your co payment and any co insurance and/or deductible amounts, if known, at the time of service. If your doctor is out of network, you will be billed for the costs of care. NYU Langone Health, your treating physicians and their respective designees, will use and disclose your health information for all purposes necessary for treatment, payment and health care operations, including but not limited to release of information requested by your insurance company (or carrier) and any information necessary for discharge planning purposes. If you do not want a claim submitted, please let us know at any time. You will be required to pay for your services in advance. You will also be required to complete a separate form. Missed Appointments • Most office visits require a one business day cancellation notice. • Procedures and surgeries may require two business days or more, please confirm with the practice directly. Weekends and holidays are not considered business days. • If you miss your appointment, or do not cancel within the required timeframe, additional fees may apply: Office Visit: $50 New Patient Visit: $75 Second Office Visit $75 Procedure/Surgery Per Dept Policy Non Medical Fees You may be responsible for additional fees such as: • Returned Checks • Completion of medical records requests • Completing disability forms • Completing medical clearance forms Out of Network Providers If your doctor is not in your insurance plan, the following apply: • You will sign a separate financial agreement • You will be quoted an estimated fee before services/procedures are performed. • Full payment is due prior to, or at the time of service for office visits. • A deposit is required prior to the date of service for elective surgeries and procedures. • Even if you have out of network benefits, you are ultimately responsible for the full fee charged. We will provide you with an itemized receipt so you may self submit to your insurance for reimbursement. Revised: 2/2024 Uninsured / Self pay Patients / Non Covered Services • If you have no medical insurance coverage, or do not have benefits for an item or service under the health plan, you will receive a Good Faith Estimate ahead of your visit with your estimated responsibility. • We may not know the full extent of services being provided this is only an estimate. • You are responsible to pay the estimate amount at time of the visit. • Payment of any balance is expected upon receiving a bill Other Bills You may receive services from doctors or other providers who are involved in your care who you may not see face to face such as anesthesia, radiology testing and pathology. These doctors provide vital services. There may be additional charges for these services. In addition, you may receive in patient or outpatient hospital care at NYU Langone Hospitals. If so, you will receive a hospital bill for those services. Hospital bills are separate from our doctor services. Payments Payment is due at the time services are provided, or upon receipt of a billing statement. We accept payment in the form of cash, check or credit card (American Express, MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and Flex Spending Card). Returned checks are subject to a fee of $20.00. We do not accept traveler’s checks. As a service to our patients, we provide an automated courtesy [bill pay reminder] call and possibly other important calls that may be placed using a prerecorded message. By providing your cell phone number, you consent to receiving such calls at this number.

If you experience hardship, you may contact us to discuss your account. Refunds If you have a credit balance, we will apply it to any open balances on your account, including any amounts owed to other NYU Grossman School of Medicine Faculty Group Practice providers.
