Executive Summary NYU Langone Hospital is submitting this Administrative Review CON application to relocate the Pediatric Congenital Heart Center located within the Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital to the first floor of 577 First Avenue, New York, New York. This relocation is needed at this time in order to accommodate the increased patient population being served. This program has achieved much success as measured by quality outcomes of the overall Pediatric Congenital Heart Program which has resulted in significant increases in patients/families seeking our care resulting in the need for additional space for more exam rooms, ECHO rooms and, the addition of Cardiac Stress Testing within the Center. This expansion will enable us to expand access to critically needed services and comprehensive care. In support of the Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital’s Congenital Heart Program as described above, the Pediatric Congenital Heart Center, serving as a comprehensive/integrated ambulatory hub for care was opened in March 2021. The Center has served over 17,000 patients (Total of 17,147 patients from March 2021 to May 8, 2024) for patients ranging in age from fetal period through young adulthood. The Center provides comprehensive care in sub specialty programs including Cardiothoracic Surgery, Cardiology, Lung Transplant, Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplant, Fetal Cardiology, ACHD, EP/Rhythm, Interventional Cardiology and Fontan Clinic which includes Hepatology. In addition to these highly developed programs, the Center offers comprehensive support services to complement the excellent surgical and medical care which include: Child Life and Creative Arts Therapy, Social Work, Psychology, Spiritual Support, and Clinical Nutrition. Critical diagnostic services such as Fetal ECHO, ECHO and EKGs as well as phlebotomy services are available as well.

Moderate to Low Risk Area Yes No Zone Description In communities that participate in the NFIP, flood insurance is available to all property owners and renters in these zones: B and X Area of moderate flood hazard, usually the area between the limits of the 100 year and 500 year floods. Are also used to designate base floodplains of lesser hazards, such as areas protected by levees from 100 year flood, or shallow flooding areas with average depths of less than one foot or drainage areas less than 1 square mile. DOH 155 B Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 5 (Revised 11/2018) C and X Area of minimal flood hazard, usually depicted on FIRMs as above the 500 year flood level. High Risk Areas Yes No Zone Description In communities that participate in the NFIP, mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply to all these zones: A Areas with a annual chance of flooding and a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Because detailed analyses are not performed for such areas; no depths or base flood elevations are shown within these zones. AE The base floodplain where base flood elevations are provided. AE Zones are now used on new format FIRMs instead of A1 A30. A1 30 These are known as numbered A Zones (e.g., A7 or A14). This is the base floodplain where the FIRM shows a BFE (old format). AH Areas with a annual chance of shallow flooding, usually in the form of a pond, with an average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Base flood elevations derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected intervals within these zones. AO River or stream flood hazard areas, and areas with a or greater chance of shallow flooding each year, usually in the form of sheet flow, with an average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Average flood depths derived from detailed analyses are shown within these zones. AR Areas with a temporarily increased flood risk due to the building or restoration of a flood control system (such as a levee or a dam). Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements will apply, but rates will not exceed the rates for unnumbered A zones if the structure is built or restored in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations. A99 Areas with a annual chance of flooding that will be protected by a Federal flood control system where construction has reached specified legal requirements. No depths or base flood elevations are shown within these zones. High Risk Coastal Area Yes No Zone Description In communities that participate in the NFIP, mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply to all these zones: Zone V Coastal areas with a or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated with storm waves. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. No base flood elevations are shown within these zones. VE, V1 30 Coastal areas with a or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated with storm waves. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Base flood elevations derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected intervals within these zones. Undetermined Risk Area Yes No Zone Description DOH 155 B Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 6 (Revised 11/2018) D Areas with possible but undetermined flood hazards. No flood hazard analysis has been conducted. Flood insurance rates are commensurate with the uncertainty of the flood risk. 4.2 Are you in a designated evacuation zone?
