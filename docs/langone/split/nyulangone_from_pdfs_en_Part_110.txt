We want to ensure staff, residents and visitors are able to recycle required materials, that the integrity of our recycling program is maintained and that waste and recycling are properly handled by our private carters. In line with that commitment we are providing additional information about NYU Langone’s Recycling Program organized as follows: 1. General Recycling Program Requirements 2. Specific Recycling Program Requirements 3. Signage Requirements 4. Decal Requirements 5. Related Components or Policies 6. Locations for Trash and Recycling Receptacles 7. Trash and Recycling Receptacle Specifications 1. General Recycling Program Requirements NYU Langone has determined that centralized sorting of trash and recyclables and movement away from individualized collection is the preferred methodology. DSNY rule of thumb: Wherever there is a trash bin, there should also be recycling bin(s). When specifying trash and recycling receptacles, the A/E Team shall:  Confirm project recycling procedures, including any landlord or building requirements. NYU Langone has chosen to pursue source separated recycling. DSNY defines source separated recycling collection as: “The practice of separating the two designated recyclable "streams" from each other and from garbage. These three streams must be kept separate from the point of generation (where staff/customers place an item in a receptacle) until the materials are placed out for collection. Your carter is then required to collect the three streams with three separate trucks or in three separate compartments in a truck.” The three streams include: Trash | Waste | Landfill Paper | Cardboard | Paperboard Recycling Metals | Glass | Plastics | Beverage Cartons Recycling  Provide adequate space on the plans for trash and recycling receptacles to be located in discreet areas (i.e. niches, alcoves, built in millwork, etc.), but still convenient to staff and visitors.  Select container gallon capacities appropriate to the designation, size and type of activity occurring within the space the receptacles serve. Avoid oversized bins (i.e. Clinical facilities shall receive receptacles that are no more than 32 gal. per container).  For Storage and Hauling, the regulation makes it illegal for any hauler to collect recyclables and trash in the same truck. Therefore, the infrastructure to keep these streams separated from point of generation to hauling must be provided by NYU Langone. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 318 2024 Project Teams must ensure adequate storage space and loading dock configuration for separated trash and recycling. It can be in the same room or on the same dock, but must be clearly separated with its own signage and labeling. Consider predicted waste volume and the activity happening in the space.  Helpful Resources: City of New York Department of Sanitation www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/home https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/docs/commercial recycling notice english.pdf AIA “Zero Waste Design Guidelines” 2. Specific Recycling Program Requirements When specifying trash and recycling receptacles, the A/E Team shall:  For Private Offices and Work Stations, do not provide deskside bins. Should staff or departmental representatives opt to have deskside bins 1 “paper only” receptacle shall be provided under the desk. Deskside bins for items other than “paper only” are not permitted.  For Open Work Areas: Provide centralized trash and recycling receptacles placed no more than 50’ 0” apart so that staff walk a maximum of 25’ 0” in either direction to access the nearest receptacle. Calculate the capacity using the following as a minimum guideline: 1 person = 1 gallon trash + 1 gallon metal glass plastic + 1 gallon paper  Provide compost receptacles at Cafés, Cafeterias and Pantries if composting is available at the site. These receptacles shall be in addition to trash and recycling. Inclusion of a sink for disposing of liquids prior to sorting of waste is encouraged.  For Back of House Areas, coordinate trash and recycling receptacle specification and locations with the Design Studio, appropriate maintenance department (i.e. Building Services, Environmental Services, etc.) and end user during the Design Development phase.  Trash and recycling receptacles shall be procured by the RED+F PM either as part of the furniture package or directly from an NYULH approved commercial maintenance products vendor. While trash and recycling built into millwork is part of the millwork package it is the responsibility of the RED+F PM to procure the specified internal rigid liner. For Confidential Paper Recycling, HIPAA paper should always be kept separate for shredding as part of NYU Langone’s existing HIPAA shredding program.  For Universal Waste Recycling, all universal waste shall be stored in accordance with EH&S safety policies and then recycled by either EH&S or MCIT.  For Lab Glass, appropriate bins shall be made available to NYU Langone labs for lab glass collection separate from the recycling program.  For Research Laboratories that utilize hazardous waste, coordinate locations with RED+F’s Design Studio and the Lab Managers. Receptacles shall be procured as outlined in this subsection not through maintenance third party vendors. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 319 2024  For Operating and Procedure Rooms, coordinate plastic recycling receptacle locations with the end user, Clinical Engineering, appropriate housekeeping department (i.e. Building Services, Environmental Services, etc.), and the Energy & Sustainability Team during the Design Development phase. These receptacles shall include rigid plastics such as supply packaging and empty saline bottles. 3. Signage Requirements There are a variety of different signs required for the Recycling Program at NYU Langone Health. The A/E Team and RED+F PM shall coordinate signage fabrication and installation with NYU Langone Design Studio’s Signage/Wayfinding Group as part of the capital project. The signs shall be located as follows:  Exterior Business Integrity Commission (BIC) hauler decals shall be displayed where they are visible from the outside of a building (if owned, leased by or occupied exclusively by NYU Langone) or tenant space (if leased by NYU Langone and we provide our own waste hauling). BIC decals are supplied by the contracted waste hauler. To obtain BIC decals coordinate with either Environmental Services or Building Services. BIC decals shall be aligned to architectural elements and placed in lower corners of storefront windows away from entry doors. BIC decals shall not be placed adjacent to entry doors, unless it cannot be avoided. Recommended locations, listed in order of highest to lowest preference, are loading docks and exterior waste storage areas, exterior building entries and interior tenant entries.  Public Areas (w/o Composting) The following signage shall be posted wherever trash and recycling centers are provided. Signs shall be printed on Sintra and installed with the bottom edge 3” above the trash and recycling center’s top surface. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 320 2024  Public Areas (w/ Composting) The following signage shall be posted wherever compost is provided in addition to trash and recycling. Signs shall be printed on Sintra and installed with the bottom edge 3” above the trash, recycling and compost center’s top surface.  Back of House Areas The following signage shall be posted in the back of house areas described below: Maintenance/Storage Areas: Areas near compactors or trash and recycling front end loader (FEL) bins, or anywhere else trash and recycling bags are aggregated and stored for more than 20 minutes. Loading Docks: Loading docks of buildings owned or leased by NYU Langone where there is waste hauling infrastructure or storage. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 321 2024 4. Decal Requirements Decals shall be posted on each trash, metal glass plastic, and paper receptacle. Cafés and Cafeterias shall receive an additional decal to be posted at each compost receptacle. The A/E Team and RED+F PM shall coordinate signage fabrication and installation with NYU Langone Design Studio’s Signage/Wayfinding Group as part of the capital project. The decals shall be applied as follows:  Front of House Receptacles Decals shall be 4 1/2” in diameter. Each decal shall be centered on and located directly below its respective opening. Decals shall be black (trash), blue (metal glass plastic), green (paper), or brown (compost in Cafés, Cafeterias and Pantries only) cut vinyl. Cafés / Cafeterias / Pantries (if required)  Back of House Receptacles Decals shall be 3” in diameter on the short side and 5” in diameter on the long side. Decals shall be centered horizontally on each side of the Slim Jim. The heights of the decals measured from the bottom of the receptacle to the center line of each decal shall be 12”. One 3” decal shall be provided on each short side and one 5” decal shall be provided on each long side of the Slim Jim for a total of 4 decals per bin. Decals shall be custom heat stamped white graphics applied by the manufacturer. Cafés / Cafeterias / Pantries (if required)  Red Medical Waste / Hazardous Receptacles Decals shall be 4” in diameter. Decals shall be centered horizontally on both the lid and front of each bin. Lid decal shall be centered vertically between the outer edge of the lid and top edge of the manufacturer logo. Front decal shall be centered vertically between the bottom edge of the lid and the top edge of the step recess. Decals shall be custom heat stamped white graphics applied by the manufacturer. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 322 2024  Cafés / Cafeterias (Wall Mounted) Decals or signs shall be custom size to fit the architecture. For example, in some cases, the decals will go on a tile wall. In those cases the decal shall be sized to match the height and width of the tiles. Each decal shall be centered on and located directly above its respective opening. Each decal shall be second surface screen printed, back painted on clear acrylic, and no paint on returns. Tray signs should also be provided and be first surface etched and paint filled on 1/4” thick horizontal brushed aluminum. 5.
