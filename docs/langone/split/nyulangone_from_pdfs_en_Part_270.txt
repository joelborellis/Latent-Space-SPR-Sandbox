Method of engagement (i.e., phone calls, community forums, focus groups, surveys, etc.) Is this person/organization supportive of this project?Did this person/organization provide a statement?If permission is granted to share a statement or quote (250 word max), please include below:Respondent 0015/15/2024organizations representing employees of the ApplicantYesZoom interviewYesYesIncreasing the number of infusion chairs at Long Island Community Hospital from 4 to 12 would have a positive impact on long term survival in the community in Suffolk County of Long Island and positively impact several underserved patients and community members living with diagnoses of chronic disease or cancer by moving the Infusion Center to across the street. We would give back surgical beds to the hospital and positively impact the surgical services of the hospital and allow more surgical care to occur at Long Island Community Hospital and positively impact the acute care in the community as well.Respondent 0025/31/2024public health expertsYesZoom interviewYesYesI would say this is a good idea to provide services locally, it will benefit the community. Only, I request they include the uninsured and under insured in there. That would be great.Respondent 0035/31/2024community leadersYesZoom interviewYesYesI would say that expansion of the Infusion Center would be a very welcomed opportunity to enhance care and treatment for people living with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia across Long Island.Respondent 0046/13/2024residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesI just wanted to say that it would be a benefit for an expansion of the treatments for the cancer at Brookhaven Hospital. I see a lot of people probably had to leave there and go to another company which is New York Blood and Cancer. And they have a center in Patchogue which is nearby. When I go to my college. Everybody is so professional and they say “you come here and we'll take care of you.” And you know I find that all over during my treatment, and I appreciate it. So having that treatment closer to where people live would be a total benefit. So I just want to say, thank you for that, plus it would help get you started quicker. I did have to wait, you know, maybe 3 or 4 weeks before I could get started, and I was so nervous and I don't know much about what the treatments all gonna be about and it would just save me about 2 and a half, 3 hours day traveling for 12 different visits, actually 16 different visits. So that's really my statement. Thank you.Respondent 0056/20/2024residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesI think it'll only be an asset for them to put in the infusion Center. I think it'll help a lot of people that you know don't have the means to travel to where you know, they might be more comfortable.Respondent 0066/25/2024residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesDitto (to see below)Respondent 0076/25/2024residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesI was a visiting nurse in the catchment area that will be LICH, and I know it very well, and I know it's very needed. And I cannot believe that the State wouldn't want to serve the communities that are Bellport, Patchogue, Mauritius. Surely all of them. There's nothing near these places. You go east from us. You have to get to Riverhead, which is 40 miles east or west, is the Long Island Community Hospital, which is under Northwell. And to my knowledge, first of all, we wouldn't be interested. But I don't know of any infusion centers under Northwell, close enough to us. So that's another viewpoint. Besides our personal viewpoint. It's my experience as having been a community healthcare person that it's very badly needed.Page 1 of 1NYULH LICH Relocate Infusion HEIA Scoping Sheet 1LabelEstimateMargin of ErrorPercentPercent
