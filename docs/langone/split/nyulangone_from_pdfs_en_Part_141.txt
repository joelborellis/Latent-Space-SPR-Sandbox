I plan to bring in a “focal point” from home I plan to wear my own clothes I would like the room as quiet as possible I would like as few interruptions as possibleThe hospital has free WiFi available.Preferences for Monitoring the Baby Before BirthDepending on your clinical condition, you may require continuous monitoring of your baby’s heart rate. I prefer to have my baby monitored intermittently (not continuous monitoring), as long as it is medically safe to do so If my baby needs to be continuously monitored, I prefer a portable monitor (if available, and if my condition permits me to move freely)Preferences for Cervical Examination I prefer as few cervical exams as possible, although I understand that periodic cervical exams may be medically necessaryPreferences for Food and Fluids I prefer to keep myself hydrated by drinking fluids. I would like to avoid intravenous (IV) fluids unless it is medically necessary I do not mind receiving intravenous hydration during labor I would like to eat lightly during laborLabor Preferences For patient safety, we advise having a member of your health care team set up IV access when you arrive. We also advise you to have a consultation with our anesthesia team. This way we can respond quickly to an emergency if one arises. I prefer to labor at home during the early phase of labor, and be admitted to the hospital when I am in active labor I would like to have freedom of movement while I am in labor (walking, standing, sitting, kneeling, using the birth ball, etc.), if safe and possible I prefer to move around or change positions before trying medication to increase my labor progress If labor is progressing normally, I prefer to be patient and let labor proceed on its own without interventions to speed it up I would prefer to wait for the amniotic membrane (bag of waters) to rupture spontaneously I would like to have my IV capped off (saline locked) so that I am free to move around during laborNamePhysicianYour Labor Support Team (please include partner, doula, friends, or relatives who will be present):Pediatrician/Family DoctorDate of BirthDue DatePersonal InformationPlease continue onto page 2Decisions are best made by you, in partnership with your provider, during prenatal visits, well in advance of the time of birth. Here are some common decision points:• whether it’s medically appropriate to wait for labor to begin on its own• whether to be admitted to the hospital in early labor or to wait until active labor• how to monitor your baby’s fetal heart rate • whether to have continuous labor support by a trained caregiver like a doula• how to help manage labor pain and labor progress• how to stay hydrated and maintain stamina (strength) during labor• whether to remain mobile and upright during labor• how to push around the time of birth• what practices to engage in shortly after your baby is born and before you go homeThis is an opportunity to share your values and preferences and make informed decisions together, based on your specific needs. While some women will need very little intervention, women with certain medical conditions may need procedures, such as continuous monitoring or induction of labor, to improve safety and ensure a healthy delivery. Your provider can tell you about the benefits, risks and alternatives of the decisions you may face during labor and birth. This form should go with you to the hospital to be shared with your care team and reviewed as labor progresses.

Your health care team will explain any new medications in detail including indication and side effects. The expected length of hospitalization after a vaginal birth is 1 2 days and after a cesarean birth 2 4 days.

Page 1 of 3 Issuing Department: Internal Audit, Compliance, and Enterprise Risk Management Effective/Reissue Date: 10/5/2016 Current Version: 4/1/2024 Breach Notification Policy NYU Langone Health will investigate all HIPAA and privacy related Incidents and provide timely notification as necessary and appropriate under federal and state laws to: • affected individuals, • the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Office for Civil Rights), • media outlets, • credit reporting agencies, and • other federal or state agencies, including the New York State Office of Attorney General (“NYS AG”) as required. Procedure 1. NYU Langone Health Workforce Members must immediately report known or suspected Incidents to Internal Audit, Compliance, and Enterprise Risk Management (“IACERM”). 2. IACERM will take immediate steps to investigate and contain the Incident and mitigate the risk of harm to affected individuals. IACERM may seek assistance from Medical Center Information Technology (“MCIT”), the Office of General Counsel, Security, Human Resources, the Office of Communications, impacted departments or units, and outside consultants as appropriate. 3. In the event the Incident involves possible criminal activity, such as identity theft or theft of valuable NYU Langone Health equipment or proprietary information, IACERM, MCIT, and/or the relevant NYU Langone Health Workforce Member will file a police report or other notification with the appropriate law enforcement division. 4. IACERM will determine whether the Incident qualifies as a Breach under applicable federal and/or state notification laws. • For purposes of HIPAA, an Incident is presumed to be a Breach and notification is necessary unless a low probability exists that Protected Health Information (“PHI”) has been compromised as demonstrated through a risk assessment. • For purposes of New York State Breach notification laws, a security Incident qualifies as a Breach if there is unauthorized access to or acquisition of, or access to or acquisition without valid authorization, of computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of private information. A Page 2 of 3 risk assessment will be completed for all incidents in compliance with New York State law. • Other states may have different definitions and requirements and any notification requirement will be evaluated by the Privacy Officer in conjunction with the Office of General Counsel. 5. Upon determination of a Breach, IACERM will take all reasonable measures to notify affected individuals. IACERM will notify federal and state agencies, credit reporting agencies, and other individuals as necessary and appropriate. Media outlets will be notified in coordination with the Office of Communications if required or deemed appropriate. All notifications will be made in accordance with regulatory requirements and without unreasonable delay. a. IACERM will engage third parties or vendors in accordance with all NYU Langone Health policies to assist, as needed, in the notification process, including providing credit monitoring services to affected individuals as required. b. Notification to the Office for Civil Rights for Breaches involving 500 or more affected individuals will be made without unreasonable delay but in no event more than 60 days after the date of discovery of the Breach. c. Notification to the Office for Civil Rights for Breaches involving fewer than 500 individuals will be made within 60 days after the end of the calendar year during which the Breach occurred. d. Notification to the NYS AG will be made within five business days of notification to the Office for Civil Rights for all cases reported to the Office of Civil Rights, regardless of whether the breach would have otherwise been reported under the New York State Breach notification laws. 6. IACERM will notify the Office of General Counsel and/or New York University Insurance Department so that any required notifications to insurance carriers can be promptly made. 7. All documentation concerning privacy incidents shall be retained for at least six (6) years by IACERM. 8. IACERM may take additional actions as necessary and appropriate to safeguard PHI and PII and to mitigate harm. This includes, but is not limited to: • providing identity theft protection services to affected individuals, • re training and educating staff members, • implementing or recommending the implementation of controls to prevent further breaches, including technological solutions, and • recommending disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or association with NYU Langone Health under guidance from Human Resources, the applicable department, and/or other applicable institutional policies. 9. As part of the required annual compliance training, all Workforce Members will be trained on how to recognize and report Incidents to IACERM. NYU Langone Health will not Page 3 of 3 retaliate against any person who, in good faith, reports a possible Incident, in accordance with NYU Langone Health policy.
