your surgeon’s office within the first 7 to 14 days after surgery. Your appointment will be scheduled before your surgery. If you do not have a follow up appointment scheduled for after your surgery, please call the scheduling office at 646.501.7223. During this appointment, your stitches and/or staples will be removed. Any braces, bandages, and dressings will also be removed. Additional steps will be taken, as necessary. These will include:• Examine you to check your circulation, wound condition, and muscle and nerve function. • Apply a new dressing and bandage. • Refit or resize your brace.The staff will review general postoperative instructions and plan your rehabilitation program with you. The type of rehabilitation program you need will be decided by your surgeon. This will depend on your condition and the type of surgery you had. See the following section on “Physical Therapy” for more information about different programs.This appointment is a good time to ask any questions that you may still have. Depending on the type of surgery you had, more follow up appointments may be scheduled at this time. TIP: Use MyChart (mychart.nyulmc.org) to schedule follow up appointments through our secure, online patient portal. CMC front desk staff can help you register an account and login. HOW DO I TAKE CARE OF MY WOUND?After your surgery, your incision (cut) will be covered by a dressing (gauze) and/or tape. You should keep your incision clean and dry to prevent infection. This will also help prevent scarring. It is important to follow your surgeon’s instructions.For arthroscopic procedures (a procedure in which an examination and sometimes treatment of damage is performed with an instrument that is inserted into the joint through a small incision), you may take off the bandage and shower the first day after your surgery. Please use a bandage before showering. If the bandage gets wet, take it off and put on a dry bandage after your shower. For open procedures, you may take off your surgical dressing, but leave on the small strips of tape (Steri StripsTM). Your wound may also be covered with a medical adhesive (Dermabond) that is used to help the wound heal without Steri Strips. You can shower on the third day after your surgery. Use a waterproof dressing over the wound. You should put clean dressings over the Steri StripsTM or Dermabond but only if the incision continues to drain. If there is swelling before the third day after your surgery, you may loosen the bandages. DO NOT take them off unless you are told to do so by your doctor. TIP: When showering, use wound protectors, which can be bought from a pharmacy.It is normal for the wound site to bleed and swell after surgery. If blood soaks onto the bandage, do not be scared or try to take off the dressing. Instead, you can use another bandage. For larger incisions, four inch by four inch gauze pads may be used and wrapped with an elastic bandage (such as an ACE BandageTM). If small strips of tape (Steri StripsTM) were used to keep the wound closed, you can expect them to fall off on their own in 7 to 10 days. If not, staples or stiches will be taken out during your first follow up appointment. Please do not try to take them out yourself.Your wound may also itch as it heals. Please do not scratch it because it may cause an infection or scarring. It is important that you do not submerge the wound site in water (for example, bathing, swimming, or hot tubs).Postoperative Instructions and Follow UpSports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 23MANAGING PAINPain can slow down or limit activity, and slow down healing and recovery. It is important to manage your pain to make sure your recovery continues as smoothly and quickly as possible.PAIN MEDICATIONSSome patients may only need to take over the counter pain medication after surgery. However, your doctor may give you a prescription for an extra strength anti inflammatory medication or a narcotic pain medication. When you take your pain medication, follow the instructions labeled on the bottle.It is very important that you call the office 3 to 4 days before your medication(s) run(s) out. Prescriptions for narcotic pain medications must be mailed to you or your pharmacy, so you need to allow enough time for this. You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol®) instead of a narcotic pain medication. DO NOT take both, because the narcotic medication may already have acetaminophen (Tylenol®) in it. DO NOT take aspirin like products unless your surgeon tells you to do so. Aspirin and aspirin like products may lead to bleeding at the site of the wound or incision (cut).If you are prescribed a narcotic pain medication, you need to watch for common side effects. These may be nausea, drowsiness (feeling sleepy), and constipation (difficulty having a bowel movement). To lessen these side effects, take the medication with food. For constipation, you can try taking an over the counter stool softener, such as docusate (Colace®, 100 mg, once or twice a day). If you feel nauseous or are vomiting, call your doctor’s office. They can change your medication. Narcotic medications may make you sleepy, so it is important to not drive or use machinery while taking them.Most people are able to reduce the amount of pain medication they take after a few days to a week and switch from narcotic medications to over the counter anti inflammatory medications. If taken as prescribed, the medications should not cause narcotic addiction. If you are worried about addiction, please talk with your surgeon or primary care doctor about this.ICINGWhen you put ice on your arm or leg, follow these instructions:3 Put the ice pack on as often as your doctor recommends: usually 20 minutes at a time, 2 to 3 times a day, for up to 3 days. 3 If your brace has a place for ice packs, be sure to take out the ice after the recommended lengthof time.3 You may also take off your brace or sling before using ice. 3 Do not put ice directly on your skin. Always use a thin layer (for example, a towel or a compression sleeve) between the ice and your skin. 24 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookWHAT CAN I EXPECT FOR MY RECOVERY? Surgery is a big event. It will take time to recover and get your strength and confidence back. You may feel frustrated, even weeks after your surgery. You will get better. Healing takes time, so be patient with yourself and the process. It is normal to feel emotional after surgery. Many patients find that they become tired more easily after surgery, or that they feel tired most of the time. These feelings are a normal part of the healing and recovery process, and may take weeks or even months to go away. It is important that you stay active — just don’t overdo it! There are some important steps to follow for a safe and speedy recovery. 3 Take your temperature twice a day. A low fever is normal after surgery. If your temperature is higher than 103° F, call your doctor.3 Take all medication as you are told. HOW DO I KNOW WHEN I SHOULD CALL MY DOCTOR? If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your surgeon right away. If your surgeon is not available, call 911 or go straight to the closest emergency room. Important contact numbers are listed in the beginning of this guide. • You cannot stop vomiting. • You feel nauseous all of the time. • You have a reaction to medication (severe itching, redness or spotting of the skin). • You can’t urinate. • You have a fever of 103° F or higher.• You have a cough or cold symptoms after surgery.• Your pain is not managed by pain medication. • Your incision is very red and there is a lot of yellow or green drainage (oozing). • You have pain in your calf (the lower part of your leg) when you bring your foot up towards your knee. • Severe (a lot of) swelling.WHEN CAN I GO BACK TO MY NORMAL ACTIVITIES?It takes time to heal and recover from surgery. You should expect that returning to your normal activities will be a slow process. Each surgery is different and the healing and recovery time will vary. To stay on track, follow your doctor’s instructions and avoid trying to “speed up” your recovery without specific direction from your doctor.Recovering at HomeMost of your recovery will take place at home. It is important that you know what to expect and how to prepare for your recovery. Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 25WHY DOES MY ARM/LEG STILL FEEL NUMB?Many people who have regional anesthesia may experience numbness or loss of feeling in their limb. This is normal and can often last 24 to 48 hours. If your arm/leg feels numb, your muscles may not work properly and may not be strong enough to support your weight. You will need to be careful moving around with crutches and may need help to make sure that you do not fall.WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MY DIET?You may not be hungry for some time after your surgery. On your first day home, start with clear liquids and light foods, such as soup or Jell O. Slowly return to your regular diet. If you feel nauseous and the nausea does not stop, or if you are vomiting, contact your surgeon. WHEN CAN I GO BACK TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY?Exercise is important for your rehabilitation. Physical therapy may start as soon as the day after your surgery, and may continue for weeks or months afterwards. Rehabilitation should be done with the guidance of your surgeon and physical therapist. You should not try to return to independent sports or athletic activities without the permission of your surgeon. For more information on specific rehabilitation exercises and instructions, see the following section on “Physical Therapy,” or the surgery guide for your specific procedure.WHEN CAN I RETURN TO WORK?During your first follow up visit, your surgeon will tell you if you can return to work. As long as your joint or limb is protected, you may be able to return to work, but do not overwork yourself. If your job is physically demanding, it may take longer to fully recover. Get back into work by slowly increasing your hours and responsibilities. Rushing back into work risks your recovery and safety.WHEN CAN I START DRIVING?Driving is probably a regular part of your daily life and important for your independence. When you can go back to driving after surgery will depend on your surgery, how comfortable you are and your recovery progress. Your pain must be managed so that you no longer need any pain medication (for example, narcotic medications such as Vicodin® or Percocet®). These medications can affect your ability to drive. Generally, patients can drive again once their sling or brace is taken off. To be safe, talk with your surgeon about this issue and get your surgeon’s permission before you start to drive again. 26 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookHOW DO I FIND A PHYSICAL THERAPIST?You should find a physical therapist before your surgery. This will give you a chance to get to know your physical therapist, tour the facility, and plan for your rehabilitation. There are often exercises that can be done before surgery (“prehabilitation”) to help with your recovery. If you do not already have a physical therapist, we can help you find one within the NYU Langone’s Rusk Rehabilitation network. Rusk Rehabilitation is the #1 rehabilitation program in New York, and one of the top ten in the country, according to U.S. News & World Report.Along with our highly skilled Rusk therapy staff, the CMC has a 7,200 square foot therapy gym, with equipment that is not available at any other center in New York City.

Our sports medicine doctors and healthcare team will recommend an individual plan for your physical therapy schedule. Following the plan under the supervision of your surgeon and physical therapist will make sure that you have the safest and fastest rehabilitation process. You should bring the rehabilitation plan with you to your first physical therapy appointment, or give it to your therapist before your surgery. Each physical therapy plan can be found in the surgery guide for your specific procedure. Physical TherapyAfter your surgery, physical therapy will be an important part of your recovery. Physical therapy can speed up and improve healing in a safe environment, under the supervision of trained physical therapists and rehabilitation staff.Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 27WHICH DME IS RIGHT FOR ME?Medical equipment will be given to you after your surgery. Someone from a medical equipment company will help you with sizing, fit, and instructions for use. It is important that you use your medical equipment as directed. For instructions on how to use your brace or sling, please see the surgery guide for your specific procedure.MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERSMany medical equipment suppliers have rehabilitation products for our patients.

WHAT WILL MY INSURANCE AND BENEFITS COVER?Before your surgery, our office will submit your insurance and related medical information to the company you choose, so that they can see if your insurance plan will cover it. Their staff will contact you before your surgery to discuss your insurance coverage and any “out of pocket” costs. These costs will depend on your individual insurance policy.After your surgery, if your insurance does not cover the prescribed equipment, the company will submit a letter of medical need to your insurance company to argue this decision. There is still no guarantee that your insurance company will pay. Some insurance policies will not cover equipment, even if it is medically needed and helpful to your recovery.Please call your insurance company before your surgery to see what your benefits are for durable medical equipment. If you are unclear as to what equipment may be prescribed for you, please call your doctor’s office. Before surgery, we recommend that you contact the medical equipment company directly with any concerns about costs or payments.Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery Handbook | 29site informationCenter for Musculoskeletal Care 30Hospital for Joint Diseases 31Housing and Dining Options 3230 | Sports Medicine: Patient Surgery HandbookHOURS OF OPERATIONSMonday through FridayRadiology: 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.Sports Medicine: 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.Joint Replacement: 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.Monday through SaturdayRheumatology: 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.DIRECTIONS AND MAPFrom Airports• LaGuardia Airport: Bus transport to Grand CentralTerminal ($10 $12).
