Living Kidney Donor Information A kidney donation may come from a living donor, who provides one of their two kidneys for a transplant. The New York Blood Center collects blood donations for patients having surgery or those receiving blood transfusions at NYU Langone. We encourage people to donate blood for themselves or for family members and friends through the autologous and directed blood donation programs at the NYU Langone Blood Bank. Please call the NYU Langone Blood Bank at 212-263-5440 if you are interested in donating blood for use at NYU Langone. Patients and directed donors can choose from a list of New York Blood Center locations in New York and New Jersey to complete the donation process, if you are eligible. Donor Eligibility In New York State, most people older than age 17 and in good health can donate blood. However, there are factors related to your medical, social, or travel history that can disqualify you as a blood donor. These include a history of hepatitis, jaundice, and heart disease. In addition, you cannot be a blood donor if it’s possible you’ve been exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or if you have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Travel to areas of the world affected by malaria or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which is more commonly known as mad cow disease, may also disqualify you. Although some of these factors may prevent you donating blood to others, you may still be able to store blood for your own use, known as autologous donation. If you have questions about your eligibility as a donor, contact the NYU Langone Blood Bank at or the New York Blood Center Donating Blood for Use at NYU Langone To donate blood for use at NYU Langone, you need a medical order signed by your doctor. You must also complete several forms to register with the New York Blood Center and the NYU Langone Blood Bank. Read our physician office instructions You must register and schedule an appointment with the New York Blood Center prior to your donation. Walk-in donors are not accepted. For help scheduling an appointment, please call the NYU Langone Blood Bank at Collection, processing, testing and shipping of blood to NYU Langone requires a minimum of five business days for autologous donations and seven business days for directed donation. For blood coming from New Jersey, please allow a minimum of 10 business days for processing. Autologous Blood Donation Autologous blood donation is the process of giving and storing blood for your own use, prior to a scheduled surgery or other anticipated need. If you have an upcoming surgery that is likely to require a blood transfusion, you can discuss autologous blood donation with your doctor. He or she can determine whether autologous donation is appropriate. Directed Blood Donation If you are likely to require a blood transfusion, which may be necessary after surgery or chemotherapy, family and friends can donate blood specifically for your use through the process of directed donation. All donated blood must be tested for infectious disease, and only blood that is compatible with your blood can be used. The Day of Your Donation On the day of your donation: Make sure that you are registered and have a scheduled appointment with the New York Blood Center. Drink plenty of fluids and eat at your regular mealtimes. Be prepared to present an official form of identification with a signature, proof of age, and a photo at the time of your donation.

Support Our Center Cardiologists Present at AHA’s Scientific Sessions 2024 Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk for Common Arrythmia Platelet Score Detects Risk of Future Cardiovascular Disease Preventing Heart Disease in Pregnant & Postpartum Patients ACC 2024: NYU Langone Cardiologists Present Research At NYU Langone’s Center for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases, our specialists use the most advanced medical technology to identify the treatment that best matches your needs. Among the most common medical issues we manage are cerebral aneurysms, which are caused by a weak area in the wall of an artery that supplies the brain. This weak spot bulges or balloons. The larger it becomes, the greater the risk of a dangerous or even fatal rupture. We are also highly experienced at managing , abnormal tangles of arteries and veins in the brain or spinal cord that can cause headaches seizures , and, in extreme situations, bleeding or hemorrhage. Endovascular techniques are commonly used to diagnose these conditions and for treatment. During an endovascular procedure, our surgeons access the part of the vascular system that needs to be treated through a large blood vessel. Diagnosis Through Angiogram During an angiogram, a contrast dye is injected through a catheter that has been inserted into a blood vessel. The dye creates a visual outline of the inside of your blood vessels, allowing doctors to see how blood flows through arteries in the neck, head, brain, and spinal cord. A digital X-ray machine is used to take a picture. This helps us diagnose a host of conditions, including venous malformations and aneurysms. Treatments for Aneurysms Three endovascular techniques are most commonly used to treat people with aneurysms: balloon remodeling, intracranial stents, and flow diverters. NYU Langone experts helped pioneer the development of both intracranial stents and flow diverters. During balloon remodeling, surgeons thread a small balloon through your blood vessels to the base of the aneurysm, which is also called the neck. The balloon creates space and gives surgeons access to the aneurysm. They then fill the bulging part of the artery with tiny metal coils. These coils fortify the walls of the aneurysm, thus reducing the chance of a dangerous rupture. After the protective coils have been placed, the balloon and catheter are removed. Our specialists may use an intracranial stent, which is a metal tube, to treat people with aneurysms that have a complex shape. The stent provides structural support, enabling the protective coils to better strengthen the site of the aneurysm so it doesn’t burst. A newer type of stent, called a flow diverter, is helpful in treating people with larger aneurysms. A flow diverter is a dense stent that can be used with or without coils. It provides the necessary support to reduce the risk of rupture. Sometimes, endovascular treatment is not the best approach. Instead, direct surgical management of the aneurysm using microneurosurgery is a more appropriate option. For this procedure, doctors perform a microcraniotomy, using the most advanced interoperative imaging procedures. Microneurosurgery provides a permanent cure for this condition. Treatment for Arteriovenous Malformation The optimal treatment for arteriovenous malformation is direct microneurosurgery. This provides an immediate and permanent cure for this condition. This surgery is performed with the assistance of imaging guidance to specify the location and extent of the arteriovenous malformation. Endovascular techniques are also used to treat people with arteriovenous malformations. A catheter is used to deliver a special glue to the arteriovenous malformation. This reduces blood flow through the malformation, causing it to shrink. A smaller malformation may then be managed through open microneurosurgery, performed with tiny magnifying glasses and surgical instruments, or radiosurgery. In , precise, high-energy beams of radiation are used to treat people with arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulas, which are abnormal pathways between arteries and veins. The goal is to completely eliminate the abnormal blood flow through the malformation, thus reducing the risk of hemorrhage, or bleeding. Radiosurgery is of particular value to people who aren’t eligible for microsurgical tumor removal, based on the location of the arteriovenous malformation or arteriovenous fistula in the brain, other medical problems, or possible risks associated with the procedure. Treatment for Vessel Blockage Intracranial bypass is used when a stroke or vessel blockage results in insufficient blood supply to a region of the brain. This procedure can also be used to supply blood to the brain when a major vessel is blocked by a tumor or needs to be sacrificed in order to remove the tumor. In this procedure, similar to heart bypass surgery, small arteries or veins are used to create a new pathway for blood to flow around the blockage or tumor. It can also be a treatment option for people with moyamoya disease—a rare condition in which the internal carotid arteries that supply blood to the brain become narrowed, limiting blood flow. Experts at our have years of experience performing this surgical technique in both adults and children. We have locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island.

Radiographs, commonly called X-rays, are medical images taken with invisible beams of radiation that create a picture on film, based on the different densities of the body’s structures. X-rays give a low dose of radiation and are limited to the area of interest, making this an extremely safe diagnostic tool to evaluate many parts of the body. If your doctor has ordered an imaging exam through your NYU Langone Health MyChart account, you can schedule most imaging exams using the NYU Langone Health app. Expert radiologists at NYU Langone’s review and interpret your X-rays to diagnose a variety of different conditions, including: arthritis bone cancer bowel obstruction broken bones emphysema gallstones joint dislocations kidney stones lung cancer pneumonia tuberculosis Preparing for an X-Ray When you book your appointment, please tell our office staff if there is a possibility that you are pregnant. Please bring your prescription and any previous imaging reports, films, or CD-ROMs from tests including X-ray, MRI scans, and CT scans, if available. Appointments are required for: arthrogram barium enema “Hypaque enema” for colostomy closure esophogram or barium swallow test hysterosalpingogram intravenous pyelogram (IVP) skeletal survey small bowel study upper GI or upper GI with small bowel cystogram voiding cystourethrogram Several of the above examinations require certain pre-test preparation, including: Barium enema: Requires bowel preparation 24 hours prior to the study. Upper GI, upper GI with small bowel, and small bowel series: Nothing by mouth for 12 hours prior to study. However, you can take your medications with as little water as possible. Esophagram: No preparation necessary, although it is preferred that you do not eat solid food for three hours before the study. IVP, cystogram, voiding cystourethrogram: No preparation necessary, although it is preferred that you do not eat solid food for three hours before study. No preparation is required for a skeletal survey or arthrogram. For hysterosalpingogram, patients should abstain from intercourse from the time that menstruation ends, and the test should be scheduled on day 5 to 10 after bleeding ceases. Patients who need X-rays are welcome to come to NYU Langone Radiology—Faculty Practice Radiology by appointment only, Monday through Friday from 8:00AM to 6:00PM. During an X-Ray Depending on the body part imaged, several images may be obtained to provide a complete evaluation. The average X-ray study takes 15 to 20 minutes. Fluoroscopy is a safe imaging technique that takes live X-ray images of the body by passing a continuous X-ray beam through the structure being studied. The X-ray images appear on a video screen in real time, which allows the radiologist to see how well the structure is functioning. Fluoroscopy is especially useful in diagnosing problems of the digestive tract, kidneys, and gallbladder. C-arm fluoroscopy is also used in pain management procedures and radiological intervention to observe the action of the instrument being used to either diagnose or treat the patient. A fluoroscopy exam often takes between 30 and 40 minutes. A contrast agent, given orally, by rectum, or by injection, is sometimes used for these studies. After an X-Ray The technologist transfers the images from your exam to a radiologist who specializes in the body part you had imaged. For instance, if you had a wrist X-ray, a musculoskeletal radiologist reviews the images. The radiologist creates a diagnostic report. The results are faxed, mailed, or transmitted electronically to your physician, who contacts you with your results.

The amount given is very small. The pharmaceutical part of the radiopharmaceutical goes to a specific place in the body where there could be disease. The radioactive part emits radiation known as gamma rays, which is detected with a gamma camera. A gamma camera allows a nuclear medicine physician to see what is happening inside your body. During this imaging procedure, the patient lies on a bed with the gamma camera positioned a few inches above his or her body. Images are taken over the next few minutes. These images allow our radiologists to diagnose a patient’s condition. Preparing for a Nuclear Medicine Scan The way you prepare for a nuclear medicine procedure depends on the type of exam you are having, such as a bone scan, hepatobiliary scan, renogram, or thyroid scan. To ensure accurate test results, follow the preparation instructions given when scheduling your appointment. When making your appointment, please indicate any medications you are taking or if you have any special needs. Please bring any previous imaging studies and reports with you if they were performed at another institution. You also need your identification card, insurance card, scan prescription, labs, and related forms. During a Nuclear Medicine Scan When you arrive for your appointment, you need to change into a gown if you are wearing any clothing with metal in it. Please advise the technologist if there is a chance that you may be pregnant. After you change, a technologist escorts you to the injection room or procedure room depending on the exam being performed. The technologist interviews you
