Our trifold mission to care, teach, and discover is achieved daily through an integrated academic culture devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research. Our Leadership, Campus Transformation, and Community Service Plan NYU Langone Health is a world-class integrated academic medical center and one of the largest health systems in the Northeast—stretching across six inpatient facilities and over 300 locations throughout the New York City region and in Florida. Guided by our purpose, to deliver the best outcomes in patient care, education, and science, our more than 51,000 staff members provide lifechanging care, innovative medical education, and groundbreaking advances in research. Our mission to care, to teach, to discover is achieved daily through a culture of exceptionalism. Our values of performance, respect, integrity, diversity, and excellence (PRIDE) influence the way we show up each and every day for our patients, our students, and our communities. A Reputation for Excellence By all accounts, NYU Langone is a premier healthcare system. Organizations like Vizient, Inc., The Leapfrog Group, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and The Joint Commission have consistently named NYU Langone No. 1 in the United States for quality and safety . We are home to 13 top-ranked specialties in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report . All of our hospitals have earned the Magnet designation for excellence in nursing and quality patient care from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, an honor achieved by only 9.7 percent of hospitals in the United States. Our Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center is designated a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), its highest recognition of achievement. Rusk Rehabilitation is consistently ranked one of the top 10 rehabilitation programs in the country by Our History NYU Langone was founded as the Medical College of New York University in 1841 by Valentine Mott, MD, the premier surgeon of his day, and five other eminent physicians and scientists. NYU Langone’s first hospital, known as University Hospital, was established in 1948, a century after its Medical College. In 1963, a newly acquired site in midtown Manhattan became the home of University Hospital’s new 18-story building. Adopting a novel concept in healthcare, the 363-bed acute-care facility—now —partnered with outpatient practices to speed the translation of scientific discovery to the clinic and allow physicians to conduct academic and research activities while maintaining private practice. The first hospital to merge with our institution was the Hospital for Joint Diseases, now known as . The 225-bed hospital, a long-time affiliate, became NYU Langone’s dedicated orthopedic hospital in 2006. In 2018, a new Science Building, NYU Langone’s largest research facility, united teams of investigators previously housed in several facilities. That same year, the plan’s capstone project, the Helen L. and Martin S. Kimmel Pavilion , became the only inpatient facility in New York City with exclusively private rooms. Of its 374 patient rooms, 68 reside in Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone , the city’s first new children’s hospital in nearly 15 years. In 2016, we acquired Lutheran Medical Center, a 444-bed acute-care hospital in southwest Brooklyn. Within several years, , as it was renamed, benefitted so greatly from our health system’s infusion of resources and expertise that it now qualifies as one of the safest hospitals not only in New York City, but in the nation. The only five-star hospital in Brooklyn, as ranked by CMS, NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn is the first and only hospital in Brooklyn to receive Magnet recognition for excellence in nursing and quality patient care. In 2019, NYU Langone extended its reach once again, this time to Nassau County on Long Island. Our acquisition of Winthrop University Hospital, a 591-bed acute-care hospital in Mineola, enlarged the NYU Langone system by 25 percent. Thanks to the same rigorous quality control measures implemented at our Brooklyn hospital, , as it was renamed, saw its average length of stay, a key measure of patient safety, decrease by nearly 20 percent in just two years. Groundbreaking Medicine In addition to providing our patients the best quality and safety outcomes, our clinicians and researchers have set new standards for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and have made or contributed to breakthroughs in biomedical science. In 2015, a team of surgeons led by Eduardo D. Rodriguez, MD, DDS , the Helen L. Kimmel Professor of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and chair of NYU Langone’s Hansjörg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery , performed the most extensive face transplant to date, followed in 2020 by the world’s first successful face and double hand transplant and in 2023 by the world’s first whole-eye and partial-face transplant In 2021, a team of surgeons led by Robert Montgomery, MD, DPhil , director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute , the H. Leon Pachter, MD, Professor of Surgery, and chair of the Department of Surgery , performed the first investigational transplant of a kidney grown in a genetically altered pig to a brain-dead person whose bodily functions were sustained by mechanical support. In separate investigational procedures performed in June and July 2022, surgeons led by Dr. Montgomery successfully transplanted hearts from genetically altered pigs into brain-dead patients, marking the latest advance toward addressing the nationwide organ shortage and developing a clinical protocol that would provide an alternative supply of organs for people with life-threatening heart disease. Transforming Medical Education has spearheaded innovations that have not only transformed the training of our own medical students, but also inspired educational reforms at other medical schools nationwide. In 2013, the school began offering an accelerated three-year MD degree for select medical students, an initiative designed to ease the financial burden of medical school and launch medical careers one year earlier than traditional students. The program made NYU Langone the first nationally ranked academic medical center in the United States to enable graduates to pursue a career in either primary care or the medical specialty of their choice in three years. Then in 2018—and through a groundswell of generosity from hundreds of alumni, NYU Langone trustees, and other scholarship supporters—the school once again made history. NYU Grossman School of Medicine became the first top-ranked medical school in the nation to provide Full-Tuition Scholarships to all new and current students, a bold strategy to reduce the staggering debt incurred by medical students due to the ever-rising cost of their education. The following year, NYU School of Medicine was renamed NYU Grossman School of Medicine in honor of the landmark educational achievements and visionary leadership of Robert I. Grossman, MD , which vaulted the school to national renown. Today, one in six medical school applicants nationwide set their sights on NYU Grossman School of Medicine. In 2019, NYU Langone expanded its medical student training when it launched , a joint venture between New York University and NYU Langone. The school, which also provides , is the only accelerated three-year MD program focused on primary care in New York State. Leaders in Research NYU Langone is setting the pace as the fastest-growing research enterprise within a top 20 medical school. NYU Grossman School of Medicine is the most productive research-intensive school of medicine, with active awards per researcher currently higher than any other top 20 medical school. Our team of 1,190 principal investigators has amassed a portfolio of NIH funding that has grown from $129 million to $663 million since 2007. In 2021, NYU Langone was selected by the NIH to be the Clinical Science Core of the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative and received a $450 million parent award. Since then, NYU Langone has successfully constructed the RECOVER Consortium, making multiple subawards to a network of lead investigators studying the long-term effects of COVID-19 at 33 institutions across the nation. These researchers coordinate data, monitor protocols, and guide communications with patients and clinicians.
