Our trifold mission to care, teach, and discover is achieved daily through an integrated academic culture devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research. Our Leadership, Campus Transformation, and Community Service Plan NYU Langone Health is a world-class integrated academic medical center and one of the largest health systems in the Northeast—stretching across six inpatient facilities and over 300 locations throughout the New York City region and in Florida. Guided by our purpose, to deliver the best outcomes in patient care, education, and science, our more than 51,000 staff members provide lifechanging care, innovative medical education, and groundbreaking advances in research. Our mission to care, to teach, to discover is achieved daily through a culture of exceptionalism. Our values of performance, respect, integrity, diversity, and excellence (PRIDE) influence the way we show up each and every day for our patients, our students, and our communities. A Reputation for Excellence By all accounts, NYU Langone is a premier healthcare system. Organizations like Vizient, Inc., The Leapfrog Group, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and The Joint Commission have consistently named NYU Langone No. 1 in the United States for quality and safety . We are home to 13 top-ranked specialties in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report . All of our hospitals have earned the Magnet designation for excellence in nursing and quality patient care from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, an honor achieved by only 9.7 percent of hospitals in the United States. Our Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center is designated a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), its highest recognition of achievement. Rusk Rehabilitation is consistently ranked one of the top 10 rehabilitation programs in the country by Our History NYU Langone was founded as the Medical College of New York University in 1841 by Valentine Mott, MD, the premier surgeon of his day, and five other eminent physicians and scientists. NYU Langone’s first hospital, known as University Hospital, was established in 1948, a century after its Medical College. In 1963, a newly acquired site in midtown Manhattan became the home of University Hospital’s new 18-story building. Adopting a novel concept in healthcare, the 363-bed acute-care facility—now —partnered with outpatient practices to speed the translation of scientific discovery to the clinic and allow physicians to conduct academic and research activities while maintaining private practice. The first hospital to merge with our institution was the Hospital for Joint Diseases, now known as . The 225-bed hospital, a long-time affiliate, became NYU Langone’s dedicated orthopedic hospital in 2006. In 2018, a new Science Building, NYU Langone’s largest research facility, united teams of investigators previously housed in several facilities. That same year, the plan’s capstone project, the Helen L. and Martin S. Kimmel Pavilion , became the only inpatient facility in New York City with exclusively private rooms. Of its 374 patient rooms, 68 reside in Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone , the city’s first new children’s hospital in nearly 15 years. In 2016, we acquired Lutheran Medical Center, a 444-bed acute-care hospital in southwest Brooklyn. Within several years, , as it was renamed, benefitted so greatly from our health system’s infusion of resources and expertise that it now qualifies as one of the safest hospitals not only in New York City, but in the nation. The only five-star hospital in Brooklyn, as ranked by CMS, NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn is the first and only hospital in Brooklyn to receive Magnet recognition for excellence in nursing and quality patient care. In 2019, NYU Langone extended its reach once again, this time to Nassau County on Long Island. Our acquisition of Winthrop University Hospital, a 591-bed acute-care hospital in Mineola, enlarged the NYU Langone system by 25 percent. Thanks to the same rigorous quality control measures implemented at our Brooklyn hospital, , as it was renamed, saw its average length of stay, a key measure of patient safety, decrease by nearly 20 percent in just two years. Groundbreaking Medicine In addition to providing our patients the best quality and safety outcomes, our clinicians and researchers have set new standards for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and have made or contributed to breakthroughs in biomedical science. In 2015, a team of surgeons led by Eduardo D. Rodriguez, MD, DDS , the Helen L. Kimmel Professor of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and chair of NYU Langone’s Hansjörg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery , performed the most extensive face transplant to date, followed in 2020 by the world’s first successful face and double hand transplant and in 2023 by the world’s first whole-eye and partial-face transplant In 2021, a team of surgeons led by Robert Montgomery, MD, DPhil , director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute , the H. Leon Pachter, MD, Professor of Surgery, and chair of the Department of Surgery , performed the first investigational transplant of a kidney grown in a genetically altered pig to a brain-dead person whose bodily functions were sustained by mechanical support. In separate investigational procedures performed in June and July 2022, surgeons led by Dr. Montgomery successfully transplanted hearts from genetically altered pigs into brain-dead patients, marking the latest advance toward addressing the nationwide organ shortage and developing a clinical protocol that would provide an alternative supply of organs for people with life-threatening heart disease. Transforming Medical Education has spearheaded innovations that have not only transformed the training of our own medical students, but also inspired educational reforms at other medical schools nationwide. In 2013, the school began offering an accelerated three-year MD degree for select medical students, an initiative designed to ease the financial burden of medical school and launch medical careers one year earlier than traditional students. The program made NYU Langone the first nationally ranked academic medical center in the United States to enable graduates to pursue a career in either primary care or the medical specialty of their choice in three years. Then in 2018—and through a groundswell of generosity from hundreds of alumni, NYU Langone trustees, and other scholarship supporters—the school once again made history. NYU Grossman School of Medicine became the first top-ranked medical school in the nation to provide Full-Tuition Scholarships to all new and current students, a bold strategy to reduce the staggering debt incurred by medical students due to the ever-rising cost of their education. The following year, NYU School of Medicine was renamed NYU Grossman School of Medicine in honor of the landmark educational achievements and visionary leadership of Robert I. Grossman, MD , which vaulted the school to national renown. Today, one in six medical school applicants nationwide set their sights on NYU Grossman School of Medicine. In 2019, NYU Langone expanded its medical student training when it launched , a joint venture between New York University and NYU Langone. The school, which also provides , is the only accelerated three-year MD program focused on primary care in New York State. Leaders in Research NYU Langone is setting the pace as the fastest-growing research enterprise within a top 20 medical school. NYU Grossman School of Medicine is the most productive research-intensive school of medicine, with active awards per researcher currently higher than any other top 20 medical school. Our team of 1,190 principal investigators has amassed a portfolio of NIH funding that has grown from $129 million to $663 million since 2007. In 2021, NYU Langone was selected by the NIH to be the Clinical Science Core of the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative and received a $450 million parent award. Since then, NYU Langone has successfully constructed the RECOVER Consortium, making multiple subawards to a network of lead investigators studying the long-term effects of COVID-19 at 33 institutions across the nation. These researchers coordinate data, monitor protocols, and guide communications with patients and clinicians.

You may receive separate bills for: your hospital stay emergency services the hospital portion of an outpatient visit doctor’s services Please contact us by phone or in person using the methods listed below if you have any questions about insurance or billing. Learn more about your hospital bill , your emergency care bill , or your physician services bill Important Information About Your Hospital Bill It is important for you to know that the hospital only bills you for hospital services. You will get separate bills from doctors. The doctors who care for you at the hospital may work in a private practice or they may be employed by the medical center. Some of these doctors may not be in the same health plan networks as the hospital. Ask the doctor admitting you to the hospital or scheduling your outpatient care if they participate in your insurance plan’s network. If a doctor or hospital is not in your plan’s network, your insurance provider will require you to pay more. In-Network Insurance Coverage: Hospital Benefits NYU Langone participates in many health plan networks. Each health plan creates a network of doctors and hospitals who have agreed to be in that network. It’s called “participating” in the plan. View the list of insurance plans in which we participate Some health plans use smaller networks for certain services, so it is important to check whether we participate in the specific plan that covers you. Our list will tell you if we are in a health plan’s network. In-Network Insurance Coverage: Physician Benefits You can look online to see if your doctors work for NYU Langone and if your doctors are part of the same networks as the hospital. View a list of insurance plans that most of our providers accept, or search for an individual doctor , including anesthesiologists, pathologists, and radiologists, to see if they are employed by NYU Langone and view their list of accepted plans. You should check with the doctor admitting you to the hospital or scheduling your outpatient treatment to find out whether other doctors will be involved in your care. Your doctor can give you their name, practice name, mailing address, and telephone number. Your doctor will also be able to tell you if you are likely to need the services of any doctors employed by NYU Langone, in which case you can obtain information at the above link. To help you understand the full impact of your financial responsibility as a patient, you can coordinate with your insurance company after your provider has identified the procedures likely to be performed, or call us at 877-648-2964 New York State Hospital Facility Fee Notice New York State law requires that patients be notified of possible hospital facility fees. Your upcoming or current service may include a facility fee. Facility fees cover a portion of your care within the hospital, such as the cost of supplies, equipment, diagnostic tests, and/or services completed by technicians, nurses, and other members of your care team. If applicable, a facility fee will appear on a good faith estimate or bill. Out-of-Pocket Costs Out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services may vary significantly across health systems, even for common procedures. At NYU Langone, we are committed to providing you with this information up front so that you can make the best choice for yourself and your family. We provide the following tools to help you estimate your out-of-pocket costs. In compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations, hospitals are required to maintain a comprehensive list of standard charges for the items and services they provide. This includes payer-specific negotiated charges for the range of items and services delivered. You may view the list of NYU Langone’s standard charges in machine-readable files. It is important to remember that standard charges do not reflect or represent the actual out-of-pocket cost a patient pays for these services. Each patient and episode of care is unique, and the actual out-of-pocket cost a patient pays may vary depending on the clinical services provided; your specific insurance plan, if you have one; the location where you received services; and other factors. For this reason, the listing may not be a useful tool for accurately understanding what patients and insurers pay for care. The list of standard charges also does not explain how patient safety and quality are factored into the cost of services provided at NYU Langone. At NYU Langone, better care leads to better outcomes. Our commitment to delivering the highest quality of care lowers costs by reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions and complications. Another way for you to get information on potential out-of-pocket costs is by viewing NYU Langone’s list of shoppable services . NYU Langone provides a list of 300 shoppable services. A shoppable service is a service that a patient can schedule in advance. These services are routinely provided in nonurgent situations, allowing you to learn more about the costs for services before receiving them. Examples of common shoppable services include imaging and laboratory services, medical and surgical procedures, and outpatient doctor visits. Similar to the list of standard charges, the shoppable services list serves as a starting point. It is important to remember that the charges for the shoppable services do not reflect or represent the actual out-of-pocket cost a patient pays for these services. To obtain the most reliable out-of-pocket fee for a service at NYU Langone, it is important to speak with your insurance company. They will be able to assist you with information regarding deductibles, copayment, and coinsurance related to the services received and in accordance with your insurance policy. When you need emergency care or are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from being charged more than your insurance plan’s copayments, coinsurance, or deductible. Learn more about your rights and protections against surprise medical bills If you do not have health insurance, please call us at 212-263-1481 to get information about an out-of-pocket cost estimate, or to learn more about our Financial Assistance Policy and your eligibility for subsidized health insurance through programs such as Medicaid. Paying Your Hospital Bill and the will send you a bill for inpatient and outpatient services, listing the charges for the care you received. A “daily care charge” on the inpatient bill covers the basic everyday work of the hospital. It includes 24-hour nursing care, food, housekeeping, and other support services. Following the terms of your insurance plan, insurance covers most of these costs and you pay the remainder. “Optional personal charges” on an inpatient bill are for any extra services received. You may have requested a meal for a family member or a private room. Health insurance does not usually cover these extra items. To make payment as simple and straightforward as possible, we ask every insured patient to pay the deductible, coinsurance, or copayment at the time of any non-emergency service. You may pay by cash, check, or major credit card. This time-of-service payment is based on our estimate of your bill, but it is only an estimate. After discharge, we will send a final bill to your insurance company. They will send you an explanation of benefits (EOB) showing what we charged and what they paid. We will send you a final bill showing the balance you owe and how to pay it. This should match the information on the EOB. If you are in active labor or require emergency services, our first priority is to take care of you. We won’t ask about payment until the doctors have told us your condition is stable. You will be asked to pay for any charges not covered by your insurance after you are discharged.

Physicians often spend up to a decade in training after earning their medical degree, a timeline that only gets longer as medicine grows increasingly complex and collaborative. To address these challenges, we pioneered the first three-year medical degree program among top academic medical schools in 2013. The goal was simple yet bold: reduce the burden of educational debt while giving students a head start on their apprenticeships as residents. Our innovative curriculum prioritizes early clinical immersion and mentorship, equipping students with the skills and guidance needed to thrive in their chosen fields, all while maintaining the highest standards of medical education. In fact, the largest study of its kind confirmed that our three-year students achieve the same milestones and meet the same rigorous requirements as their peers in traditional four-year programs. The ultimate validation, however, is the clinic: our graduates consistently excel in prestigious residency programs and competitive fellowships, making a significant impact in their fields.

Researchers at have found that women experiencing chest pain wait 11 minutes longer to receive care in the emergency department than men with the same symptoms, highlighting a critical gap in heart attack diagnosis and treatment. To address this disparity, our cardiologists have developed a deep understanding of women’s heart health. We know that women who are experiencing a heart attack may describe their symptoms—especially chest pain—differently from men. We also use the latest diagnostic tools to determine the cause of women’s heart symptoms so that we can create the best possible treatment plans. This is one of the many ways our health system leverages the latest research to provide top-quality patient care. Women’s Heart Attacks Are Often Misdiagnosed.

Liver Transplant Program 212-263-8133 Living Liver Donation Experts at the Liver Transplant Program, a part of the , provide care for adults and children in need of a liver transplant. We also offer complete medical and surgical care for people who have a wide range of acute or chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B and C ; cholestatic liver disease; sclerosing cholangitis; acute fulminant liver failure; hepatocellular carcinoma, meaning liver cancer ; and biliary tract disorders. Leaders in Liver Transplant We are the No. 1 liver transplant program in New York State, based on the SRTR outcomes of fast transplant rates and high patient survival. According to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), which tracks data related to solid-organ transplants in the United States, we are the top liver transplant program in New York and have a 100-percent one-year survival rate for people who receive a liver from a living donor. We are also one of the top centers in New York for getting a deceased donor liver faster and for our one-year survival rate for recipients. Care for children with liver-related conditions is provided through our Pediatric Liver Transplant Program , part of . Through our Latino Liver Program , we provide the most medically advanced and culturally conscious care to Hispanic and Latino/a/x children and adults who need or may need a liver transplant or liver surgery. Your Liver The liver is the largest solid organ in the human body, located under the rib cage on the upper right side of the abdomen. It has many life-sustaining functions, making it one of the most important organs in the body. It aids digestion by breaking down and storing nutrients, including fats, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. It aids circulation by filtering and processing blood to remove harmful substances. The liver is also responsible for manufacturing proteins that enable blood to clot. Support the Liver Transplant Program Make a monetary donation to support our work in liver transplantation. Injury to the liver from conditions such as hepatitis, liver cancer, metabolic dysfunction liver disease, or drug toxicity, excessive alcohol consumption, or nutritional deficiencies can lead to acute liver failure or chronic scarring, known as cirrhosis. The damaged liver is unable to carry out its many functions. People with these conditions may experience progressively worsening symptoms. Our hepatology, transplant hepatology, and surgery teams provide diagnosis and treatment for all liver conditions. For some people with severe or advanced liver disease, a liver transplant may be their best treatment option. When a Liver Transplant Is Needed If you have been referred for a liver transplant evaluation, your physician has recognized these signs of liver failure, and a transplant may be your best option. There are two sources of liver donation: from a living donor , which is someone willing to donate a piece of their liver, and from a deceased donor, whose family has consented to donate the entire liver. In the United States, deceased donors are the most common source of livers for transplant. NYU Langone’s renowned liver and transplant specialists diagnose liver conditions and help you weigh your treatment options to determine whether a transplant is the best approach. We conduct liver transplant evaluations and provide pre- and post-transplant outpatient care at our Manhattan location and on Long Island. Other Types of Liver Surgery Our surgeons also specialize in the following procedures. Hepatobiliary Surgery Our specialists perform nontransplant to manage a variety of diseases affecting the liver, bile duct, and gallbladder. Advanced techniques, including minimally invasive and conventional surgery, are used to treat people with these conditions. Procedures include the following: surgical removal of benign and malignant diseases of the liver, including hepatocellular carcinoma surgical repair or removal of the gallbladder and bile duct to treat people with benign and malignant disease laparoscopic repair of bile duct injuries and bile duct stones laparoscopic gallbladder removal Surgery for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma involves removing the diseased portion of the liver. This usually includes the tumor and surrounding tissue. The patient’s liver is able to regenerate within a few weeks, depending on the size of the portion removed.

We are located in Manhattan. 646-501-4481 At NYU Langone’s Face Transplant Program, part of the and under the leadership of , our experts have performed multiple face transplants. These include the first face transplant in New York State the world’s first whole-eye and partial-face transplant We are pioneers in face transplant surgery, as one of only a handful of medical centers in the United States—and the only one in New York State—with a dedicated program for face transplants. Research Program We have a clinical research study open to selected patients who have sustained facial trauma or disfigurement, burns, and acquired malformations of the face. Pioneers in Face Transplant Surgery A face transplant is an incredibly complex procedure that requires the expertise of more than 100 physicians, nurses, medical staff, and support staff. This surgery involves the transplantation of facial tissue from a deceased donor to a person with a severe facial deformity. A face transplant has the potential to transform a person’s life by restoring function, appearance, and sensation in the face, as well as enhancing overall quality of life. VIDEO: Aaron James received a whole-eye and partial-face transplant. We use the most advanced three-dimensional (3D) imaging technology before and during the surgery to create a model of the donor’s face, map out the complex procedure for the recipient, develop a plan to achieve maximum aesthetic and functional results, and guide the entire operation. As innovators, our experts in the Face Transplant Program continue to perform research to improve all aspects of this procedure. Recently, our surgeons achieved the shortest wait time of approximately 18 months, from initial injury to the face transplant surgery, for a patient. This substantial reduction in wait time allows for better physical and emotional recovery for our patients. “I am very grateful to be given a second chance.” Joe, Age 22 Read All Face Transplant Patient Stories Our surgeons’ experience and expertise have also helped them reduce the length of the surgery itself, which lowers the risk of complications for patients. This reduced surgery time helps to decrease the amount of time a patient stays in the hospital after the procedure, allowing them to return home sooner. After our patients leave the hospital, they continue outpatient rehabilitation therapy through , which often involves a combination of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. They also take anti-rejection medications to help the body’s response to the new organ, and NYU Langone’s new anti-rejection therapies are helping to provide better outcomes for our patients. Groundbreaking Transplant Procedures Using the cutting-edge technology and expansive operating rooms found in NYU Langone’s , our highly skilled surgical teams simultaneously operate on donors and recipients to perform innovative transplant procedures. Whole-Eye and Partial-Face Transplant Building on the surgical expertise gained from our previous face transplant procedures, our team was the first to perform a whole-eye and partial-face transplant. Our surgeons transplanted the donor’s entire left eye and a portion of the face to the recipient, helping to restore appearance. This procedure demonstrates how our team continues to embrace innovation in the field of face transplantation. Face and Double Hand Transplant Our team was also the first in the world to successfully transplant both hands to the mid-forearm and the full face of a single donor to the same recipient. The groundbreaking success of this combination transplant procedure illustrates our team’s dedication to taking on new challenges and advancing the field of transplantation. If you are a physician or a patient who would like more information about our face transplant services, please contact us at 646-501-4481 or email FaceTransplant@NYULangone.org Whole-Eye & Partial-Face Transplant Is a World First Podcast: Rising Above the Challenges of COVID-19 Face & Double Hand Transplant at NYU Langone Is Successful Man Receives First Successful Face & Double Hand Transplant NYU Langone Performs First Successful Face & Hand Transplant 22-Year-Old Receives First Successful Face & Hand Transplant Podcast: Would You Risk It All for a New Face? A Novel Approach to Preventing Face Transplant Rejection A New Face & a Second Chance Imaging Services for Referring Physicians The board-certified radiologists at NYU Langone specialize in acquiring and interpreting images for specific parts of the body or specific diseases. We refine our clinical skills by collaborating with colleagues to review the care plans of patients and share clinical expertise at professional conferences. We are consistently adding new services, improving our imaging with state-of-the-art MRI and CT scanners, and enhancing the way we communicate with our referrers with new tools, such as the multimedia report, in order to better serve our physicians and patients. The multimedia report is a new way of communicating with our clinicians that we are currently working on and preparing for widespread use at NYU Langone. The multimedia report is an enhanced, easy-to-use imaging report that includes embedded images that link the report to a corresponding imaging study, making it easier to understand the study’s important findings.

Learn More About Our Expertise subspecialties, research, and training programs Lung Transplant Program 550 First Avenue View Location Details 866-838-5864 At the Lung Transplant Program, a part of the , we are dedicated to managing advanced lung diseases. We offer people 12 years of age and older effective treatment options and provide excellent care through every stage of the lung transplant process. Treatment for children is provided at the Pediatric Kidney Transplant Program through Excellent One-Year Survival One-year survival after lung transplantation is 94.19 percent. Our excellent 94.19 percent one-year survival rate in adults after transplantation—combined with our patients getting a transplant faster, low mortality on the transplant list, and the high volume of transplants we perform—makes us the top-ranked lung transplant center in the country, as calculated by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). Our doctors may recommend a single- or double-lung transplant for people with chronic, end-stage lung disease when maximum medical therapy offers no relief or when no effective therapy exists. In 2023, 97 percent of our lung transplants were bilateral, leading to better outcomes for our patients. People who have one of the following conditions may be candidates for a lung transplant: interstitial lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis sarcoidosis , hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pulmonary manifestations of collagen vascular disease, eosinophilic granuloma, and lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM) pulmonary vascular disorders, such as primary pulmonary hypertension obstructive lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , emphysema, and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency bronchiectasis , including cystic fibrosis other rare conditions that affect the lungs Your physician or pulmonologist may refer you to the NYU Langone Transplant Institute for evaluation, or you may contact us yourself. This does not mean automatic acceptance as a transplant candidate. Rather, it’s the beginning of an evaluation process that determines whether a lung transplant is the right choice for you, and whether you are a suitable candidate for the procedure. Your First Visit Support the Lung Transplant Program Make a monetary donation to support our leading lung transplant program. During your first visit, our lung transplant team meets with you to review your medical records and radiology films. You are asked to complete a six-minute walking test to determine how far you’re able to walk during that time and to measure your oxygen levels. You complete this test at every subsequent visit, and doctors measure the results each time against those from your first visit. Next, one of our transplant physicians meets with you to discuss your medical history and conduct a complete physical examination. If the physician determines that you’re a candidate to begin transplant evaluation testing, our transplant nurse coordinator schedules additional tests that begin approximately two weeks after your initial visit. Lung Transplant Evaluation Once our experts begin your lung transplant evaluation, our transplant nurse coordinator schedules tests and consultations with members of the lung transplant team, including the following: radiology tests cardiac catheterization and other cardiac tests, such as an echocardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) lab work, such as a blood test to check for antibodies in the blood, blood type test, chemistries, complete blood count (CBC), hepatitis panel, HIV test, and immunoglobulin panel meetings with a social worker, financial coordinator, dietitian, pharmacist, and lung transplant surgeon In addition to examining the results of the evaluation, our team considers the type and severity of lung disease, symptoms, and your age. Throughout the process, we continually consider whether you are a suitable candidate for a lung transplant and make sure that you and your family have all the necessary information to make an informed decision. If our team determines that you are a lung transplant candidate, we help you prepare for candidacy. Based on the results of your evaluation tests, you are assigned a Lung Composite Allocation Score, or CAS, and our transplant nurse coordinator places you on the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) national waiting list. Your place on the list is determined by your CAS and your blood type. Once you are on the waiting list, you must be prepared for surgery whenever donor lungs become available. We conduct lung transplant evaluations and provide pre- and post-transplant outpatient care at our Manhattan location. After Lung Transplant Surgery In the months after your transplant, you have frequent checkups with our team. At these checkups, our experts make sure you are doing well, adjust your medications if necessary, and monitor you for infections or other complications. Our lung transplant team pioneered the use of remote health monitoring after lung transplant and that reduce the need for checkups in person. Treatment for Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, or CTEPH, is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs caused by repeated blood clots or clots that do not dissolve. Our cardiothoracic surgeons perform the recommended treatment for CTEPH, which is a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. During this highly precise surgery, you are placed on a heart–lung machine—a device that pumps oxygenated blood to your body—as the surgeon carefully clears the blood vessels from the inside. This allows blood to again flow normally through the previously blocked areas.

What to Bring to Your Exam Please bring the following to your appointment: a list of your current medications your insurance card a form of identification with your picture on it a prescription or written request for the imaging exam, if provided by your physician Radiation safety is a top priority when you receive at NYU Langone. Small amounts of radiation are used in medical imaging, such as X-rays nuclear medicine studies, to produce detailed images of the human body. For example, a chest X-ray gives you about the same amount of radiation as you would get from taking four airplane flights from New York to Los Angeles. While the small amount of radiation used in medical imaging is unlikely to cause harm, we use the lowest amount of radiation necessary to produce diagnostic images because of the potential risk. We continually strive to find the right balance between producing high-quality images and minimizing the potential harm to patients. Latest Technology to Reduce Radiation Doses In our ongoing efforts to protect our patients, we invest in the latest technology that can deliver higher-quality images at lower radiation doses. We also continually monitor the radiation produced by our equipment, and submit these values to the American College of Radiology’s national database that tracks radiation doses from CT scanners across the country. We regularly compare our radiation doses against other institutions to ensure that we are exceeding the current radiation safety standards of the medical imaging community. Our CT scanners are equipped with software that monitors the amount of radiation you are exposed to during your exam. If there is a risk that the radiation exposure may increase beyond our threshold for safety, our CT technologists can modify the exam to ensure that only a safe level of radiation is emitted. During an X-ray, each study is focused on the area of the body that is of most interest to your doctor, to avoid any unnecessary radiation to other parts of your body. Our X-ray technologists also use radiation shields and aprons to protect areas that are sensitive to radiation and not necessary for the imaging tests, such as the breasts in women and reproductive organs in men and women. We also use tracking and monitoring systems to ensure that our nuclear medicine imaging equipment is working properly and that the radiation is controlled within safe, standard limits.

Some people at risk for stroke may receive intravenous drugs to dissolve a blood clot, or a procedure to remove the clot with a catheter. Some people with more serious injury may need the neurocritical care provided by specialty trained neuro-intensivists and nurses in our intensive care units. A patient care coordinator guides you through any lifestyle changes and medical care that may be recommended to prevent stroke and its complications. Advanced Surgical Care Our specialists provide a full range of advanced treatment approaches, including open microneurosurgery, in which tiny instruments and microscopes are used to perform procedures on the smallest blood vessels. They also perform endovascular surgery, which enables surgeons to use the blood vessels as direct pathways to the part of the body that needs treatment. Our doctors offer radiosurgery with Gamma Knife technology , which allows for the precise delivery of radiation when treating people with blood vessel conditions in the brain, such as brain arteriovenous malformations. Leaders in Stroke Research Experts at Rusk Rehabilitation’s Motor Recovery Research Lab conduct clinical trials to develop better treatment options and care for people who have had a stroke. Learn More About Stroke Research The highly skilled neurosurgeons at our also specialize in performing extracranial–intracranial bypass surgery—often called cranial bypass or cerebral bypass surgery—to improve blood flow to the brain and prevent strokes. Our team has years of experience performing this surgical technique for people who are at risk for recurrent stroke or bleeding inside the brain. Our world-class facilities include hybrid surgical suites that feature built-in three-dimensional and four-dimensional imaging technology and computer image guidance systems that our doctors use to treat the most complex conditions. This type of image-guided surgery aids your doctor in making important decisions such as determining the best place to make an incision, the optimal path to the targeted area, and the critical areas in the brain or spinal cord to avoid. The use of this technology has been shown to shorten the length of surgery, decrease the size of the incision, improve outcomes, and speed recovery.

With heart disease as the leading cause of death in women, our dedicated specialists provide the tools you need to prevent heart disease, and the compassion and support you need to navigate diagnosis and treatment. U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Hospitals” ranks NYU Langone the No. 2 hospital in the nation for cardiology and heart surgery. Women’s Heart Conditions We Treat Our cardiologists treat heart conditions that disproportionately affect women. We create a personalized care plan that may include medications and lifestyle changes such as incorporating heart healthy nutrition, exercise, and stress reduction into your daily routine for the following conditions: heart attack with no blockage , also known as myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), which is different from typical heart attack caused by severe blockage from cholesterol plaque chest pain or angina with no blockage , also known as ischemia (reduced blood flow), with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA); this condition can be caused by coronary microvascular dysfunction, or dysfunction of blood vessels feeding the heart that are too small to be seen on standard imaging tests, or coronary artery spasm, the sudden and temporary tightening of arteries that carry blood to the heart spontaneous coronary dissection (SCAD), a blood collection in a heart artery wall infection or inflammation of the blood vessels, which may temporarily block blood flow to the heart takotsubo syndrome (also known to some as broken heart syndrome), a sudden weakening of the heart muscle that arises with a mentally or physically stressful event such as the death of a loved one Our physicians also work with interventional cardiologists to manage blocked arteries caused by coronary artery disease cardiac surgeons for conditions such as aortic dissection , or a tear in the aorta, and specialists at the Heart Rhythm Center to manage AFib , or other irregular heartbeat disorders. We may refer you to doctors at our Heart Failure Advanced Care Center cardiomyopathy or diastolic heart failure (also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), a condition in which the heart does not relax properly between beats and pumps out less blood. In addition, our cardiologists also work with our cardiac team at our Heart Valve Center to manage heart valve disorders. Providers at the and physiatrists specializing in cardiac rehabilitation services may also be a part of your care team. Our Expertise in Women’s Heart Health Our cardiologists have a deep understanding of your health needs and use the latest technology to ensure an accurate diagnosis. We listen to ensure you feel heard and understand that women who have coronary artery disease or are experiencing a heart attack may describe their symptoms—especially chest pain—differently from men . The same is true for women who are experiencing or other cardiovascular conditions. Advanced Diagnostic Tools In addition to taking a thorough medical and family history, our cardiologists use the latest diagnostic tools to determine the cause of your symptoms. If we suspect a blockage is not the problem, we may order a special provocation test that is available at only a handful of other medical centers in the United States. During this test, we may also check for coronary microvascular dysfunction. We may refer you to our cardiac imaging and testing services to assess the heart and blood vessels. Testing in our cardiac catheterization laboratory may help us to detect blocked arteries. Our women’s cardiology specialists are also exploring new ways to image the heart and blood vessels through our innovative clinical trials. We have discovered that women may benefit from several types of imaging to accurately diagnose their condition. Preventive Care in Women A heart-healthy lifestyle that prioritizes diet, exercise, stress management, and getting enough sleep is one of the most effective ways to prevent heart disease, and we partner with you to help you realize these goals. Certain women are at higher risk of heart disease. Risk factors include or a history of pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes during . Our cardiologists may work with specialists at NYU Langone Heart’s Cardio-Obstetrics Program to manage heart health before, during, and after pregnancy. Hormonal changes that occur with menopause can also raise the risk of heart disease. If you are receiving cancer treatment, your risk for heart problems can increase. Our doctors may refer you to specialists in our Cardio-Oncology Program to support your cardiovascular health as you navigate cancer care. If you are at a high risk of developing a heart condition, we can refer you to our specialists at the Affiliated Programs and Centers Our specialists in women’s cardiology collaborate with a team of experts to manage your heart or vascular condition.

Our highly skilled neurosurgeons have years of experience performing this surgical technique in both adults and children. During this procedure, a blood vessel located outside the skull that flows in the scalp is diverted and connected to a blood vessel in the brain. Rerouting blood flow to the brain provides additional flow that reduces stress on the body’s circulation and lessens the risk of stroke or bleeding inside the brain. Cranial bypass can often be a treatment option for people with moyamoya disease—a rare condition in which the internal carotid arteries that supply blood to the brain become narrowed, limiting blood flow. Our neurosurgeons perform cranial bypass surgery in both adults with moyamoya disease and children with moyamoya disease. Care for children is provided through During your first visit, our doctors review your symptoms, imaging studies such as CT and MRI scans, and other test results to assess the best treatment approach for your condition. For those patients who have had a previous stroke, we work with your stroke neurologist to determine if you are a candidate for the procedure. Surgery is performed at our world-class facilities within NYU Langone’s , which includes two floors dedicated to neurosurgical care, including seven operating rooms (ORs) and a neuro-intensive care unit dedicated to neurosurgical recovery. Our “smart” ORs are digitally integrated and are equipped with the most advanced technology to ensure superior neurosurgical outcomes. Continuing Medical Education for Clinicians Join our experts as they discuss diagnosis, treatment, and management of moyamoya disease in this virtual webinar. After surgery, you are cared for by our multidisciplinary neurocritical care and neurosurgery teams that specialize in caring for patients after brain surgery. Most people who have cranial bypass surgery will have significantly reduced their risk for further strokes, and no additional treatment is needed. If rehabilitation is needed to address the effects of previous strokes, the specialists at can develop a treatment plan to help.

At NYU Langone’s Pituitary Center, our experts are leaders in advanced treatment for people with all types of pituitary tumors and disorders. Our doctors treat more than 300 patients each year and care for those with rare and complex pituitary conditions, such as Cushing disease, acromegaly, prolactinoma, cranial pharyngioma, and Rathke cleft cyst. We routinely see patients who have already had surgery elsewhere or have been told by physicians at other centers that their condition cannot be treated. We are also recognized as a center of excellence for the treatment of pituitary disorders by the Pituitary Network Association. We bring together a team that includes neurosurgeons; endocrinologists; otolaryngologists, also known as ear, nose, and throat specialists; neuro-ophthalmologists; radiologists; and pathologists. Our team ensures that people with pituitary conditions get the most effective treatment, using the latest technology and tools. Advanced Care for Pituitary Disorders For most patients, our endocrinologists strive to treat the hormonal changes associated with pituitary diseases through medication management. If surgery is needed, our neurosurgeons use innovative technology to perform fully endoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive technique that helps ensure a rapid recovery. We also offer Gamma Knife radiosurgery to manage small pituitary tumors in people who cannot have surgery or to treat small portions of tumors that are not completely removed after surgery. Our operating rooms are digitally integrated and are equipped with the most advanced technology, including Surgical Theater, a three-dimensional platform for planning and performing surgery, and Brainlab, integrated software for surgical planning, surgical navigation, and data management. NYU Langone is also home to two intraoperative MRI machines, which allow our neurosurgeons to make real-time decisions based on imaging results during surgery and also enable our surgeons to more thoroughly remove pituitary tumors in less time. Advanced intraoperative imaging helps clarify the boundary between normal gland tissue and tumor, which not only improves rates of tumor removal but also reduces the risk of gland dysfunction after surgery. Leaders in Pituitary Disorders Research As leaders in pituitary disorders research, our neurosurgeons and endocrinologists collaborate with neuroradiologists to better refine imaging techniques to find and treat pituitary tumors. To detect microadenomas—tumors less than 1 centimeter in diameter—NYU Langone neuroradiologists have pioneered the use of 2 types of state-of-the-art MRI: golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) and constructive interference in steady state (CISS). Both GRASP and CISS MRI scans offer ultra-high-resolution images and allow our doctors to better detect small, hard-to-find microadenomas and successfully remove them using noninvasive surgical techniques. In addition, neuroradiologists and nuclear medicine physicians combine these MRI sequences with PET scans to find rare ectopic tumors in people who have acromegaly or Cushing disease. Our team also is proud to collaborate with the North American Skull Base Society to conduct research on improving surgical outcomes on a national level. In collaborating with other large academic centers throughout the country, we help to develop the standards for pituitary surgical excellence.

View All Locations (4) 646-501-7200 Experts at the Endoscopic Spine Surgery Program, a part of NYU Langone’s , offer a groundbreaking approach to care of the neck and lower back. Using an endoscope—a narrow tube with a light and high-definition camera on the end—our surgeons can see the inside of the body on a screen in real time, which helps them perform highly precise spine surgery. This ultra-minimally invasive approach requires only one or two small incisions. Your Spine: An Operator’s Manual Everything you need to know about staying nimble and pain-free from our top-ranked spine experts. View the Book The Benefits of Endoscopic Spine Surgery Endoscopic spine surgery allows our surgeons to protect the surrounding tissues and structures of the spine. The surgery is safe and effective, restoring function and relieving pain from conditions such as degenerative disc disease herniated disc This type of surgery is similar to knee or shoulder arthroscopy. It is typically done on an outpatient basis, meaning you can go home the same day. Recovery time, ranging from one to two weeks, is faster than with open surgery, and you can quickly return to your daily activities, improving your quality of life. Our Surgical Expertise Our knowledge of the latest endoscopic treatments reflects NYU Langone’s excellence and innovation in spine surgery. While most endoscopic spine surgeries use a single incision, several of our surgeons specialize in a more advanced procedure—biportal endoscopic surgery—which uses two tiny incisions, less than one centimeter long. This procedure is only available at a few other medical centers in the United States. Biportal endoscopic surgery allows surgeons to use one incision for the endoscope and the other for the surgical instruments. This two-portal approach further improves surgical precision and protects the spine and surrounding tissues. Our Supportive, Team-Based Approach to Care In addition to our surgical expertise, our team of specialists provides you with the support you need as you make important treatment decisions about your spine health. Orthopedic and neurosurgery spine surgeons, rehabilitation doctors, pain management physicians, neurologists, advanced practice providers, and registered nurses work together to listen to your concerns and provide you with personalized care before, during, and after spine surgery. Physical and occupational therapists may also be a part of the care plan. Spine Conditions We Treat Our doctors can help determine whether you are a candidate for endoscopic spine surgery. We typically use this surgery to treat conditions of the lower back or lumbar spine, including these: spinal stenosis radiculopathy, which is pinching of the nerve near the root sciatica, or injury of the sciatic nerve that originates in the lower spine We may also use endoscopic spine surgery for conditions in the neck or cervical spine, such as disc degeneration, spinal stenosis, or a herniated disc. Endoscopic Spine Surgeries We Perform Our doctors may recommend one of the following surgeries as part of your spine care plan: endoscopic microdiscectomy: removes a piece of herniated disc or can relieve pain caused by radiculopathy or sciatica endoscopic laminectomy or decompression: removes a portion of the lamina, which is the bony arch of the vertebra, to treat spinal stenosis endoscopic fusion: connects bones of the spine to stabilize it to treat spondylolisthesis, severe disc degeneration, or herniated disc Our endoscopic spine surgery program leads the way in creating treatment guidelines that ensure the safe and responsible use of new endoscopic techniques for spine surgery. This work enables us to provide the highest quality of care and the best possible outcomes for our patients.

But surgery is just one part of what we do. At your first appointment, one of our specialists performs a thorough exam. We also discuss your treatment goals and expectations regarding recovery from surgery. We take into consideration your desired outcome when determining the treatment approach that is best for you. Our doctors treat people with peripheral nerve conditions related to entrapment, contraction, injury, and tumors. We perform conventional open surgery as well as minimally invasive procedures. During surgery, our intraoperative monitoring team enhances accuracy and safety by monitoring your motor skills and your body’s reaction to touch, pressure, and pain. We also use electromyography to check muscle and nerve health. If you have neurofibromatosis type 1 or neurofibromatosis type 2 , which are conditions that cause tumors to grow on the spine and nerves, we work closely with the neurologists, oncologists, and otolaryngologists—also known as ear, nose, and throat doctors—at NYU Langone’s Comprehensive Neurofibromatosis Center Neurosurgeons at the Peripheral Nerve Center are supported by a team of physician assistants and neurosurgical nurses who monitor you closely, starting before surgery and through your recovery. Our , including meditation and acupuncture, can help you cope with stress or anxiety before and after your treatment. Within a day of the procedure, you are evaluated by a physical therapist from NYU Langone’s . This specialist determines the type of rehabilitation therapy you require, if any, and if it should be completed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Our team of neurosurgeons meets weekly to discuss our patients. So, although you are cared for by one doctor, you benefit from the collective expertise of a group of neurosurgeons who collaborate to make the best decisions about your care. Our neurosurgeons specialize in surgery of the peripheral nervous system. Our Affiliated Programs NYU Langone neurosurgeons are sought by patients around the world for their skill and expertise. We are leaders in the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, and schwannomatosis. Our neuro-oncologists provide comprehensive care for people with cancer of the spine and nervous system. When you come to NYU Langone for treatment of a neurological condition that might require surgery, you may have had one or more of the following diagnostic tests so that doctors can pinpoint the cause of your condition and develop effective treatment strategies. As a new patient, please bring copies of any previous test results for your surgeon to review. Cerebral Angiogram Some diseases, such aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and vasculitis , affect the blood vessels of the brain. A cerebral angiogram is the gold standard for assessing these conditions. This test involves injecting dye into the blood vessels of the brain and then taking X-rays of these vessels. The patient lies flat on a table and a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin. The catheter is then passed through the arterial system to the head, where the dye can be injected. This is typically a painless procedure. CT Myelogram Some patients with implanted metal devices cannot undergo MRI scanning. In order to assess the spinal cord in these patients, a special type of CT called a CT myelogram can be done. In this test, contrast dye is not injected into the blood, but rather into the cerebrospinal fluid that coats our brain and spinal cord. This injection is done by means of a spinal tap or lumbar tap. Local anesthetic is given prior to the needle being placed in the lower back. CT scans allow surgeons to pinpoint the location of lesions in the brain or spinal cord. It is particularly useful in determining if there is bleeding in the brain, or bony destruction in the spinal column. For this test, you are asked to lie on a comfortable, open-air table while a series of special X-rays are taken. A simple head CT can take less than 30 seconds. Scans of other body parts may take up to 30 minutes. Some tests require that intravenous contrast dye be administered. People with kidney problems, allergies to shellfish, or previous reactions to contrast dye should make certain that their physician is aware of these conditions prior to receiving contrast dye. Nerve Conduction Studies If a person has weakness or twitching in a muscle, an electromyogram, or nerve conduction study, can help to distinguish between problems in muscles, in the nerves that support the muscles, or in the spinal cord itself. A sterile needle is placed into the muscle. From the needle, small electrical signals are recorded when the muscle is contracted and when it is relaxed. This process is repeated for each muscle to be tested. This is similar to acupuncture. Nerve Conduction Velocity Nerve conduction velocity tests assess peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the spinal cord with the muscles. Electrodes are placed over the nerve to be assessed as well as the muscles it stimulates. Small electric shocks are applied at one electrode. Physicians use the time it takes for these electrical pulses to reach the other electrode to determine if a disease of the peripheral nerves is the cause of pain, weakness, or numbness in the muscle. Lumbar Puncture Cerebrospinal fluid bathes and protects our brain and spinal cord. Examining this fluid can be important in determining if an infection or tumor has spread to this part of the body. The fluid is obtained by a lumbar puncture or spinal tap. The patient is placed on his or her side with the knees tucked to the chest in a fetal position. An area in the middle of the low back is numbed with local anesthetic. A needle is then inserted and fluid removed. The procedure generally takes less than a minute or two. In experienced hands, this procedure is minimally painful. While a CT scan is particularly useful for assessing bony anatomy, MRI is best for imaging soft tissues, such as the brain and spinal cord. The MRI works by assessing the alignment of hydrogen atom nuclei in a very powerful magnetic field. The use of a magnet rather than ionizing radiation is another advantage of MRI over CT. However, because of this magnet, people with heart pacemakers and some other implantable devices cannot undergo MRI testing. Additionally, some patients will find that the longer testing period of MRI, sometimes up to one hour, in a small confined space can induce feelings of claustrophobia and anxiety. Patients who are at risk for such feelings can be given appropriate sedating medication prior to the procedure. Neurological Examination The neurological examination is divided into five parts: mental status, cranial nerves, motor function, sensory function, and reflexes. In the mental status exam, you are asked questions designed to assess your level of alertness, orientation, mood, and cognition. The simplest form of this test requires that you state your name, where you are, and the month, year, and date. You may also be asked to follow commands, such as “Touch your right ear with your left index finger,” solve simple arithmetic problems, repeat a phrase, name an object and what it is used for, or write your name. Cranial nerves are responsible for strength and sensation in the head. Special senses, including vision, hearing, smell, and taste, are part of these tests. A light is shone in your eyes to assess pupil reactivity. Your peripheral vision or visual fields as well as visual acuity are assessed. Eye movements are assessed by having you follow the examiner's moving finger without turning your head. Facial muscles are tested by having you close your eyes tightly, raise your eyebrows, and smile widely. You are also asked to stick out your tongue, shrug your shoulders, and turn your head from side to side as part of the cranial nerve test. The motor function examination tests muscle strength. Individual muscles in both the upper and lower extremities on both sides are tested. Motor assessment will often start with the drift test. You will be asked to place your arms outstretched in front of you with your palms facing upward. You will then be told to close your eyes and count to 10 out loud without moving your outstretched arms. This test can often detect subtle weakness on one side of the body. The remainder of motor function testing is completed by having you bend or straighten a joint, such as the elbow, against resistance provided by the examiner. For example, in order to test the triceps muscle in the back of the arm, you will be told to keep your arm straight at the elbow while the examiner attempts to bend it. The sensory function examination tests your sense of touch. You are told to keep your eyes closed while the examiner lightly touches your skin with a safety pin. You are asked whether the sharp or dull end of the pin touched your skin. This can detect lesions in the spinal cord. Another important part of the sensory exam is assessment of proprioception, a measure of how well you can sense your body’s position and movements. Again with your eyes closed, your toe or your finger will be moved either up or down. You will then state which direction your finger was moved in. This ability to determine the relative position of body parts—without looking—can be compromised by certain neurological conditions. To test reflexes, a small rubber hammer is used to check response at the knee, elbow, wrist, and ankle. These reflexes may be exaggerated or absent in certain pathological conditions. Additionally, the bottom of the foot or the fingernail of the middle finger may be stroked to elicit certain abnormal reflexes. Depending on the suspected neurological condition, the examiner may do other tests as well. For example, the examiner may wish to observe you walking or have you slide the heel of one foot up and down the shin of the opposite leg. Shunt Series and Shuntogram A common neurosurgical operation involves the diversion of excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain. Most commonly, a tube called a shunt is tunneled under the skin from the brain to the abdomen. This implantable device generally stays in place for life. Problems with the shunt, including infection, obstruction, or disruption of the tubing, are occasionally encountered. Workup for a shunt problem includes several tests. A CT scan tells doctors how much CSF is in the brain. Excessive CSF can mean that the shunt is not working properly. A shunt series is a simple set of X-rays of the skull, chest, and abdomen that can reveal a break in the tubing. A shuntogram is a more sophisticated study that involves placing a radioactive isotope in the shunt reservoir in the head and measuring the speed with which it moves to the abdomen. Delayed movement of CSF to the abdomen may imply a problem with the shunt. Lastly, a shunt infection may be assessed by sterilely removing some spinal fluid from the shunt reservoir and sending it to the microbiology lab for culture. Swallow Study Certain neurological conditions can impair a person’s ability to swallow. If there is some question as to whether you can safely be allowed to eat, a swallow study can be done. This involves taking X-rays while you eat food and liquids mixed with barium. This test is done under the supervision of a speech pathologist who determines how well you are able to swallow foods of various consistencies. Simple X-rays are often useful in assessing the bones of the skull and spine. X-rays of the spine can be used to evaluate fractures or misalignment. X-rays are also particularly useful in determining the stability of the spine. This is achieved by taking X-rays of the cervical or lumbar spine both in flexion, bent forward at the neck or hips, and extension, straightened at the neck or hips. The surgeon or radiologist looks for abnormal movement of the bones of the spine on these dynamic images. 317 East 34th Street, 8th Floor 855-698-9998 Transplant Institute Heart Transplant Program Kidney Transplant Program Living Kidney Donation Pancreas Transplant Program Pediatric Transplant Surgery Transplant Institute Patient Stories Top Program in New York We are the premier transplant center in New York, performing one of the highest volumes of transplants with top quality outcomes.

Fastest Transplant Rate in the Northeast We provide rapid medical evaluation to determine whether a transplant is right for you. Here are some of the most important ways in which our program stands out: Support the Heart Transplant Program Make a monetary donation to support our work in heart transplantation. Our heart program continues to have the highest patient survival in the nation amongst programs who performed more than 35 transplants a year, and the best one-year patient survival in New York State. Additionally, the heart program also has the fastest transplant rate in the Northeast. In 2023, our heart transplant program performed the highest number of heart transplants in the Northeast. Nader Moazami, MD , surgical director of heart transplantation, brings more than two decades of experience to the NYU Langone Transplant Institute. He has performed more than 1,000 heart transplants. When a Heart Transplant Is Needed People who are candidates for a heart transplant typically have heart failure, and other treatments for it have been unsuccessful. They may experience shortness of breath during very light levels of activity or have severe and frequent chest pain. Doctors at our can help you explore all your treatment options. Some of the most common causes of heart failure include the following conditions: (genetic, hypertrophic, idiopathic, infectious, postpregnancy, postviral, or restrictive) congenital heart defects heart damage caused by a heart attack First, your doctor explores all nontransplant treatment options for heart failure. If those methods are unsuccessful, your doctor may refer you to the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, or you may call us directly to schedule an appointment. Our doctors review your medical records and sometimes order additional cardiac tests, such as right and left heart catheterization, an echocardiogram, or a cardiopulmonary exercise stress test. After any preliminary tests are complete, a doctor meets with you to discuss your medical history and conduct a complete physical exam. If the doctor determines that you’re a suitable candidate for transplant evaluation testing, the transplant nurse coordinator schedules additional tests that begin approximately two weeks after your first visit. In addition to our transplant care for adults, we also care for children through the Pediatric Heart Failure and Transplant Program Heart Transplant Evaluation When you come to NYU Langone for heart transplant evaluation, our team conducts several different types of tests: lab tests not conducted during your first visit a pulmonary function test tests to check for blockages in the carotid arteries in your neck a test to measure blood flow in the veins and arteries of your legs During the evaluation, you also meet with our heart transplant cardiologist and surgeon, as well as a transplant nurse coordinator, dietitian, financial coordinator, pharmacist, and social worker. Throughout this process, our team evaluates whether a heart transplant is the best option for you, and keeps you and your family up to date so that you can make an informed decision. We conduct heart transplant evaluations and provide pre- and post-transplant outpatient care at our Manhattan location and on Long Island at NYU Langone Cardiology Associates—Mineola and in partnership with the Heart Success program at Morristown Medical Center, part of the Atlantic Health System. Bridge to Transplant Therapies For some people, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or a total artificial heart can help maintain or improve your overall health while you wait for a donor heart. These “bridge to transplant” therapies are provided by our transplant surgeons and doctors from NYU Langone’s Heart Failure Advanced Care Center. Left Ventricular Assist Device Before a transplant, our cardiac experts may recommend that you receive an LVAD, a small electric pump that is connected to your heart to help it pump blood. If you are considered ineligible for a heart transplant, our team may recommend using an LVAD as a destination, or lifelong, therapy. The process to qualify for destination therapy is similar to the evaluation process for a heart transplant. Total Artificial Heart A total artificial heart can be another treatment option for people with advanced heart failure. Unlike an LVAD, which supports only the heart’s left ventricle, a total artificial heart replaces both ventricles and takes over all the work of pumping blood to the lungs and then out to the body. The device is connected to a portable external console, which can be used outside of the hospital. Heart Transplant Candidacy If our team determines that a heart transplant is the best treatment option for you, we help you prepare for candidacy. Our transplant nurse coordinator places you on the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) national waiting list. You are then assigned a heart transplant status, which is based on how urgently you need a heart. After you have been placed on the waiting list for a donor heart, you need to be prepared for surgery whenever a heart becomes available. The wait time for a heart varies and depends on your blood type, body size, medical urgency, and other factors. When a suitable heart becomes available, you are admitted to the hospital if you have been waiting at home and prepared for heart transplant surgery. After Heart Transplant Surgery In the months after your transplant, you have frequent checkups with our team. At these checkups, our experts make sure you are doing well, adjust your medications as needed, and monitor you for infections or other complications. After your transplant, you also have heart biopsies—more frequent in the beginning and then gradually less often—so that our team can make sure your new heart is not being rejected. Our team is dedicated to your success and support after your heart transplant. Your care team continues to see you regularly after surgery for as long as needed. Our doctors are leaders in the field of heart transplantation. Nader Moazami Heart Transplant Surgical Director Alex Reyentovich Heart Transplant Medical Director AA Amit H.

We provide care for children at the When a Kidney Transplant Is Needed People are born with two kidneys, one on each side of the spine. Kidneys are responsible for filtering blood and removing excess fluid and waste products from the body, which then leave the body as urine. Support the Kidney Transplant Program Make a monetary donation to support our work in kidney transplantation. The kidneys also regulate blood pressure, ensure electrolyte and acid–base balance, and aid in the production of new bone tissue and red blood cells. When kidney function is impaired, as in acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease , the kidney can no longer perform these activities. This puts a person at risk for medical complications that can include , swelling, life-threatening electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and bone loss. Kidney disease may progress to the point where dialysis, a treatment that uses a machine to remove fluid and waste from the blood, is needed. While on dialysis or even before dialysis is started, your doctor may recommend a transplant. While you wait for a donor kidney, you have regular appointments at our transplant clinic with our doctors, who collaborate with your referring physician to ensure continuity in your medical care. Forms of Kidney Transplant Kidney donations come from either living donors , who consent to the donation, or from deceased persons, whose families consent to donate the person’s organs. Deceased donors are the most common source of kidneys for transplant. VIDEO: Patient Milissa Rocker Klotz and Dr. Bruce Gelb talk about Milissa’s living donor kidney transplant. In either situation, the organ is removed from the donor and placed into the recipient by our team of highly skilled transplant specialists. Our medical team supervises the recovery of living donors to ensure they can quickly return to an active lifestyle. After transplant, all patients are followed closely in our outpatient transplant clinic. Our doctors are leaders in the field of kidney transplantation. Nicole M.

Lee Pablo Loarte-Campos Bonnie E. Lonze Aprajita Mattoo Irfana Soomro Vasishta Tatapudi 10 We provide specialized care for children who have kidney disease and may need a transplant. Living Kidney Donor Information A kidney donation may come from a living donor, who provides one of their two kidneys for a transplant. The New York Blood Center collects blood donations for patients having surgery or those receiving blood transfusions at NYU Langone. We encourage people to donate blood for themselves or for family members and friends through the autologous and directed blood donation programs at the NYU Langone Blood Bank. Please call the NYU Langone Blood Bank at 212-263-5440 if you are interested in donating blood for use at NYU Langone. Patients and directed donors can choose from a list of New York Blood Center locations in New York and New Jersey to complete the donation process, if you are eligible. Donor Eligibility In New York State, most people older than age 17 and in good health can donate blood. However, there are factors related to your medical, social, or travel history that can disqualify you as a blood donor. These include a history of hepatitis, jaundice, and heart disease. In addition, you cannot be a blood donor if it’s possible you’ve been exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or if you have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Travel to areas of the world affected by malaria or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which is more commonly known as mad cow disease, may also disqualify you. Although some of these factors may prevent you donating blood to others, you may still be able to store blood for your own use, known as autologous donation. If you have questions about your eligibility as a donor, contact the NYU Langone Blood Bank at or the New York Blood Center Donating Blood for Use at NYU Langone To donate blood for use at NYU Langone, you need a medical order signed by your doctor. You must also complete several forms to register with the New York Blood Center and the NYU Langone Blood Bank. Read our physician office instructions You must register and schedule an appointment with the New York Blood Center prior to your donation. Walk-in donors are not accepted. For help scheduling an appointment, please call the NYU Langone Blood Bank at Collection, processing, testing and shipping of blood to NYU Langone requires a minimum of five business days for autologous donations and seven business days for directed donation. For blood coming from New Jersey, please allow a minimum of 10 business days for processing. Autologous Blood Donation Autologous blood donation is the process of giving and storing blood for your own use, prior to a scheduled surgery or other anticipated need. If you have an upcoming surgery that is likely to require a blood transfusion, you can discuss autologous blood donation with your doctor. He or she can determine whether autologous donation is appropriate. Directed Blood Donation If you are likely to require a blood transfusion, which may be necessary after surgery or chemotherapy, family and friends can donate blood specifically for your use through the process of directed donation. All donated blood must be tested for infectious disease, and only blood that is compatible with your blood can be used. The Day of Your Donation On the day of your donation: Make sure that you are registered and have a scheduled appointment with the New York Blood Center. Drink plenty of fluids and eat at your regular mealtimes. Be prepared to present an official form of identification with a signature, proof of age, and a photo at the time of your donation. We have doctors in Manhattan and on Long Island. The cardio-oncologists at create personalized care plans for people who are newly diagnosed with cancer, are receiving cancer treatment, or have successfully completed cancer treatment. We protect your heart while you are receiving cancer treatment and help you maintain and improve your cardiac health once treatment is complete. Recognizing our expertise, the Cardio-Oncology Program at NYU Langone has been designated as a Gold Center of Excellence by the International Cardio-Oncology Society. Managing Cardiovascular Health During Cancer Treatment Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and other approaches can increase the risk of developing conditions such as these: cardiomyopathy or heart failure heart attack heart rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation (AFib) and atrial flutter heart valve disease, including mitral valve aortic valve disease lipid disorders (e.g., high cholesterol) Our cardio-oncologists work with cancer specialists at NYU Langone’s to identify whether you may be at risk of developing any of these cardiovascular complications. To do this, our specialists assess your history of cardiovascular disease, screen for underlying risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes , and use advanced cardiac testing and imaging to examine the overall health of your heart and blood vessels. We then create a tailored preventive care plan. This may include lifestyle changes, such as nutrition and exercise, or medication. During treatment, we partner with your oncologist to ensure you receive cancer treatment that optimizes your survival and quality of life, all while protecting your heart health. Cardiac Care for Cancer Survivors Cardiovascular complications can develop years after cancer treatments are over, so we may monitor your heart health with ongoing checkups. If you are an adult survivor of childhood cancer, we can create a surveillance program that considers the increased risk of cardiovascular complications, such as coronary artery disease, valve disease, or heart failure. We also work with specialists at the Cancer Survivorship Program at Perlmutter Cancer Center to support your health throughout your lifetime. Our doctors are pioneers in the field of cardio-oncology.

Support Our Center Cardiologists Present at AHA’s Scientific Sessions 2024 Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk for Common Arrythmia Platelet Score Detects Risk of Future Cardiovascular Disease Preventing Heart Disease in Pregnant & Postpartum Patients ACC 2024: NYU Langone Cardiologists Present Research At NYU Langone’s Center for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases, our specialists use the most advanced medical technology to identify the treatment that best matches your needs. Among the most common medical issues we manage are cerebral aneurysms, which are caused by a weak area in the wall of an artery that supplies the brain. This weak spot bulges or balloons. The larger it becomes, the greater the risk of a dangerous or even fatal rupture. We are also highly experienced at managing , abnormal tangles of arteries and veins in the brain or spinal cord that can cause headaches seizures , and, in extreme situations, bleeding or hemorrhage. Endovascular techniques are commonly used to diagnose these conditions and for treatment. During an endovascular procedure, our surgeons access the part of the vascular system that needs to be treated through a large blood vessel. Diagnosis Through Angiogram During an angiogram, a contrast dye is injected through a catheter that has been inserted into a blood vessel. The dye creates a visual outline of the inside of your blood vessels, allowing doctors to see how blood flows through arteries in the neck, head, brain, and spinal cord. A digital X-ray machine is used to take a picture. This helps us diagnose a host of conditions, including venous malformations and aneurysms. Treatments for Aneurysms Three endovascular techniques are most commonly used to treat people with aneurysms: balloon remodeling, intracranial stents, and flow diverters. NYU Langone experts helped pioneer the development of both intracranial stents and flow diverters. During balloon remodeling, surgeons thread a small balloon through your blood vessels to the base of the aneurysm, which is also called the neck. The balloon creates space and gives surgeons access to the aneurysm. They then fill the bulging part of the artery with tiny metal coils. These coils fortify the walls of the aneurysm, thus reducing the chance of a dangerous rupture. After the protective coils have been placed, the balloon and catheter are removed. Our specialists may use an intracranial stent, which is a metal tube, to treat people with aneurysms that have a complex shape. The stent provides structural support, enabling the protective coils to better strengthen the site of the aneurysm so it doesn’t burst. A newer type of stent, called a flow diverter, is helpful in treating people with larger aneurysms. A flow diverter is a dense stent that can be used with or without coils. It provides the necessary support to reduce the risk of rupture. Sometimes, endovascular treatment is not the best approach. Instead, direct surgical management of the aneurysm using microneurosurgery is a more appropriate option. For this procedure, doctors perform a microcraniotomy, using the most advanced interoperative imaging procedures. Microneurosurgery provides a permanent cure for this condition. Treatment for Arteriovenous Malformation The optimal treatment for arteriovenous malformation is direct microneurosurgery. This provides an immediate and permanent cure for this condition. This surgery is performed with the assistance of imaging guidance to specify the location and extent of the arteriovenous malformation. Endovascular techniques are also used to treat people with arteriovenous malformations. A catheter is used to deliver a special glue to the arteriovenous malformation. This reduces blood flow through the malformation, causing it to shrink. A smaller malformation may then be managed through open microneurosurgery, performed with tiny magnifying glasses and surgical instruments, or radiosurgery. In , precise, high-energy beams of radiation are used to treat people with arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulas, which are abnormal pathways between arteries and veins. The goal is to completely eliminate the abnormal blood flow through the malformation, thus reducing the risk of hemorrhage, or bleeding. Radiosurgery is of particular value to people who aren’t eligible for microsurgical tumor removal, based on the location of the arteriovenous malformation or arteriovenous fistula in the brain, other medical problems, or possible risks associated with the procedure. Treatment for Vessel Blockage Intracranial bypass is used when a stroke or vessel blockage results in insufficient blood supply to a region of the brain. This procedure can also be used to supply blood to the brain when a major vessel is blocked by a tumor or needs to be sacrificed in order to remove the tumor. In this procedure, similar to heart bypass surgery, small arteries or veins are used to create a new pathway for blood to flow around the blockage or tumor. It can also be a treatment option for people with moyamoya disease—a rare condition in which the internal carotid arteries that supply blood to the brain become narrowed, limiting blood flow. Experts at our have years of experience performing this surgical technique in both adults and children. We have locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island. Stroke Treatment Outcomes Certified as a Comprehensive Stroke Center We provide the most advanced stroke care, as recognized by The Joint Commission and New York State Department of Health.

Radiographs, commonly called X-rays, are medical images taken with invisible beams of radiation that create a picture on film, based on the different densities of the body’s structures. X-rays give a low dose of radiation and are limited to the area of interest, making this an extremely safe diagnostic tool to evaluate many parts of the body. If your doctor has ordered an imaging exam through your NYU Langone Health MyChart account, you can schedule most imaging exams using the NYU Langone Health app. Expert radiologists at NYU Langone’s review and interpret your X-rays to diagnose a variety of different conditions, including: arthritis bone cancer bowel obstruction broken bones emphysema gallstones joint dislocations kidney stones lung cancer pneumonia tuberculosis Preparing for an X-Ray When you book your appointment, please tell our office staff if there is a possibility that you are pregnant. Please bring your prescription and any previous imaging reports, films, or CD-ROMs from tests including X-ray, MRI scans, and CT scans, if available. Appointments are required for: arthrogram barium enema “Hypaque enema” for colostomy closure esophogram or barium swallow test hysterosalpingogram intravenous pyelogram (IVP) skeletal survey small bowel study upper GI or upper GI with small bowel cystogram voiding cystourethrogram Several of the above examinations require certain pre-test preparation, including: Barium enema: Requires bowel preparation 24 hours prior to the study. Upper GI, upper GI with small bowel, and small bowel series: Nothing by mouth for 12 hours prior to study. However, you can take your medications with as little water as possible. Esophagram: No preparation necessary, although it is preferred that you do not eat solid food for three hours before the study. IVP, cystogram, voiding cystourethrogram: No preparation necessary, although it is preferred that you do not eat solid food for three hours before study. No preparation is required for a skeletal survey or arthrogram. For hysterosalpingogram, patients should abstain from intercourse from the time that menstruation ends, and the test should be scheduled on day 5 to 10 after bleeding ceases. Patients who need X-rays are welcome to come to NYU Langone Radiology—Faculty Practice Radiology by appointment only, Monday through Friday from 8:00AM to 6:00PM. During an X-Ray Depending on the body part imaged, several images may be obtained to provide a complete evaluation. The average X-ray study takes 15 to 20 minutes. Fluoroscopy is a safe imaging technique that takes live X-ray images of the body by passing a continuous X-ray beam through the structure being studied. The X-ray images appear on a video screen in real time, which allows the radiologist to see how well the structure is functioning. Fluoroscopy is especially useful in diagnosing problems of the digestive tract, kidneys, and gallbladder. C-arm fluoroscopy is also used in pain management procedures and radiological intervention to observe the action of the instrument being used to either diagnose or treat the patient. A fluoroscopy exam often takes between 30 and 40 minutes. A contrast agent, given orally, by rectum, or by injection, is sometimes used for these studies. After an X-Ray The technologist transfers the images from your exam to a radiologist who specializes in the body part you had imaged. For instance, if you had a wrist X-ray, a musculoskeletal radiologist reviews the images. The radiologist creates a diagnostic report. The results are faxed, mailed, or transmitted electronically to your physician, who contacts you with your results.

The amount given is very small. The pharmaceutical part of the radiopharmaceutical goes to a specific place in the body where there could be disease. The radioactive part emits radiation known as gamma rays, which is detected with a gamma camera. A gamma camera allows a nuclear medicine physician to see what is happening inside your body. During this imaging procedure, the patient lies on a bed with the gamma camera positioned a few inches above his or her body. Images are taken over the next few minutes. These images allow our radiologists to diagnose a patient’s condition. Preparing for a Nuclear Medicine Scan The way you prepare for a nuclear medicine procedure depends on the type of exam you are having, such as a bone scan, hepatobiliary scan, renogram, or thyroid scan. To ensure accurate test results, follow the preparation instructions given when scheduling your appointment. When making your appointment, please indicate any medications you are taking or if you have any special needs. Please bring any previous imaging studies and reports with you if they were performed at another institution. You also need your identification card, insurance card, scan prescription, labs, and related forms. During a Nuclear Medicine Scan When you arrive for your appointment, you need to change into a gown if you are wearing any clothing with metal in it. Please advise the technologist if there is a chance that you may be pregnant. After you change, a technologist escorts you to the injection room or procedure room depending on the exam being performed. The technologist interviews you to take a detailed medical history before administering a radiopharmaceutical. The exam type determines if images are taken shortly after, several hours later, or the next day. The scan length depends on the type of exam. During the scan, you are visible to and can communicate with the technologist, who is present in the room at all times. After a Nuclear Medicine Scan At the end of the scan, the nuclear medicine physician on duty reviews your images. The results of the scan are interpreted by our nuclear medicine physicians and sent immediately to your referring physician, who contacts you with the results. Nuclear Cardiology Stress Testing A specialized type of nuclear imaging is nuclear cardiology stress testing. Experts at NYU Langone’s nuclear cardiology stress testing laboratory perform a range of tests that help cardiologists diagnose and assess many forms of heart disease. Testing is performed daily under the supervision of a board-certified cardiologist, and studies are interpreted by cardiologists and radiologists with advanced training in nuclear cardiology and cardiac imaging. Patients are referred to our laboratory for a variety of reasons. Many patients with cardiac risk factors, such as smoking, high cholesterol, family history of heart disease, , are referred to our experts to be evaluated for the likelihood of In addition, patients with chest pain or other high-risk symptoms are referred to us to find out whether heart disease is the cause of these symptoms. Patients with a known history of heart disease are often sent to us for an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of their medications. Finally, nuclear imaging of the heart is also used to provide information on the strength of the heart muscle. Stress testing most commonly involves exercise on the treadmill. For patients who are unable to exercise, pharmacologic substitutes can be used, including dipyridamole, adenosine, regadenoson, and dobutamine.

MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses, and a computer to produce detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and other internal structures of the body. X-rays are not used as part of this technology. Images can be displayed and examined on a computer monitor, transmitted electronically, printed, or copied to a CD. Radiologists at NYU Langone review and interpret your MRI results to diagnose a variety of different diseases, including abdominal, cardiac, musculoskeletal, neurological, and spine-related conditions. NYU Langone MRI scanners have short bore technology, which makes for a more comfortable scanning experience. Short bore means that the length of the tube you're in during the scan is shorter than usual. Your head and neck may be outside the tube, unless that is the area you are having scanned. If you are claustrophobic, please discuss this with your doctor prior to your MRI appointment. If sedation is prescribed by your doctor, notify the front desk when you arrive that you are taking prescribed medication for your exam. Why Doctors Order an MRI Scan NYU Langone doctors use detailed MRI images to better evaluate various parts of the body in order to determine the presence of certain diseases that may not be adequately assessed with other imaging methods, such as ultrasound However, MRI takes longer than a CT scan, and may not be ideal for all parts of the body. For example, air-filled structures, such as the lungs, are not well evaluated with MRI and may be better evaluated using CT. Depending on what information your doctor needs, the MRI scan may require the use of a contrast agent given through a vein to assist doctors in seeing certain anatomical structures within your body. For Those with Implanted Devices Because MRI technology involves the use of a magnetic field, our schedulers need to ask if you have any metal implanted devices, as well as the make and model of those devices. The reason for these questions is that certain implants may prevent you from having your exam for safety reasons. Asking as much information up front helps us make your experience at the time of the scan as efficient and as fast as possible. Examples of problematic implants include: cardiac pacemakers or old pacemaker wires brain aneurysm clips middle ear prostheses neurostimulators Please tell the intake personnel and your technologist if you have a prosthetic device, such as a hip or knee replacement. In most cases, the presence of this type of replacement does not exclude you from having an imaging exam performed. This information is helpful, though, in terms of modifying the type of MRI study performed. Patients should not wear any eye makeup or hairspray. Believe it or not, they contain metal and can cause problems in a MRI scanner. What to Bring to Your MRI Scan Please bring any previous imaging study results, such as reports, films, or CD-ROMs, from tests that may include X-rays, MRI scans, and CT scans, if they are available. On the day of your exam, bring your prescription, insurance card, and any related insurance forms or pre-approvals. We are able to play a variety of music during your MRI—if you have a preference, simply bring a CD or iPod. Preparing for an MRI Scan Preparation for your MRI depends on the type of exam you are having. If you are having a cholangiogram, or a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, you need to fast for four hours prior to your exam. If you are having an MR-enterography exam, you are required to drink oral contrast. If your doctor has ordered an MRI with contrast using gadolinium, and you have a history of diabetes, kidney problems, or high blood pressure, you must have your creatinine level checked prior to your MRI. The blood test must be taken within six weeks of your exam. If you have had or will be having a liver transplant, the bloodwork must be performed within one week of the exam. During the MRI Scan When you schedule your appointment, our scheduling associate lets you know how early to arrive. Depending on the exam, it may be 30 to 60 minutes before your appointment. This allows you enough time to register and complete all necessary paperwork, forms, or questionnaires. Please indicate any possibility of pregnancy to your physician and the scheduling office when you book the appointment. When you arrive, inform the MRI technologist as well. Gowns are provided for your exam. We have private dressing rooms with lockers for your clothes and valuables, although we recommend that you leave your valuables at home. Please remove all body piercings, jewelry, watches, eyeglasses, hairpins, wallets, and other metallic objects prior to your exam. After you have removed all metal objects, our MRI technologist positions you on the table of the scanner. Your head is placed in a padded plastic cradle or on a pillow, and the table slides into the scanner. An intercom system allows you and the technologist to communicate with each other at all times. In order to obtain clear pictures, you are asked to hold very still and to relax. You may be asked to hold your breath for up to 20 seconds. Any movement during the scan, especially of your head or back—even moving your jaw to talk—can blur and degrade the pictures. The machine makes rapid, loud thumping noises as it takes images. During this time, you should breathe quietly and normally and refrain from moving, coughing, or wiggling. There are multiple series of image acquisitions, each with its own particular noises. When the thumping noise stops, you must be still and maintain your position in the scanner. The entire exam typically takes between 30 and 60 minutes depending on exam type. After an MRI Scan After your procedure, you are escorted back to the dressing room. You are typically able to leave and resume your regular diet and activities. Occasionally, a procedure requires that you stay to be monitored afterward. If you brought prior images for comparison, you can pick them up at the front desk when you leave. Our specialized radiologists read the MRI images and dictate a report that is sent immediately to your referring physician, who contacts you with the results.

To make an appointment, call If you and your doctor decide that spinal surgery is the best treatment for your spine condition, the renowned orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons at the work together to create a personalized treatment plan for you. Whenever appropriate, we use minimally invasive approaches, many of which NYU Langone experts helped pioneer. These techniques allow for smaller incisions, a shorter recovery time, and a quicker return to the activities you enjoy. We use the most advanced navigation and surgical technologies available. For example, our surgeons use Precision Virtual Reality for procedures treating spinal deformities. Developed and refined by NYU Langone neuroradiologists, this technology turns MRI images into three-dimensional virtual reality landscapes, allowing surgeons to view a patient’s anatomy from any angle to improve the accuracy of the procedure. Dr. Anthony Frempong-Boadu performs surgery using advanced, real-time spinal navigation. Our intraoperative monitoring team helps ensure your safety during the procedure by observing your motor skills, checking muscle and nerve health, and monitoring your reaction to touch, pressure, and pain. Our surgeons are supported by a team of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and neurosurgical nurses who monitor your progress and care for you with compassion, starting before surgery and continuing through recovery. Conditions We Treat with Spine Surgery We treat a broad range of conditions that affect the spine: degenerative conditions, such as osteoarthritis of the spine complex spinal problems associated with a previous failed surgery scoliosis and kyphosis in in children adults cervical and lumbar herniated discs neuromuscular diseases spinal cord and spinal column tumors all spinal fractures, including spine compression fractures spine trauma intradural and extradural spinal pathologies vascular lesions of the spinal cord and spinal column congenital conditions such as , tethered cord syndrome, diastematomyelia, Chiari malformations, and hemivertebrae Spine Procedures We Perform Our surgeons have expertise in a range of surgical procedures, some of which can be performed on an outpatient basis, allowing you to return home the same day. Discectomy or Microdiscectomy Discectomy and microdiscectomy both refer to decompression surgeries to remove the portion of a disc that is herniated and pressing on a nerve. These procedures preserve mobility. Cervical Laminoplasty and Laminectomy During this decompression procedure, a surgeon enlarges the spinal canal, the space through which the spinal cord passes, to alleviate stenosis and preserve mobility. Foraminotomy Foraminotomy is a decompression procedure in which surgeons enlarge the space through which a nerve passes out of the spinal canal. These spaces, called foramina, can become partially blocked with bone or other tissue. Surgeons remove the obstruction to free the nerve and preserve mobility. Laminectomy and Laminotomy During a laminectomy, a surgeon removes the back part of a vertebra, called the lamina, to provide more space to a nerve or a portion of the spinal cord that is being compressed. If only a portion of the lamina is affecting the nerve, the surgeon may remove some of the tissue in a procedure called laminotomy. Both procedures preserve mobility. Disc Replacement In a disc replacement, which is performed to decompress nerves or part of the spinal cord in the cervical or lumbar spine, surgeons replace a worn or damaged disc between two vertebrae with an artificial disc, or “spacer.” No plates or fusion is needed for this procedure, which preserves mobility. Your doctor may recommend disc replacement rather than spinal fusion if you have a herniated disc in your neck and are younger than 65. Spine Fusion Surgery Spine fusion surgery is performed to stabilize the spine or to straighten a crooked spine. During the procedure, a surgeon permanently joins, or fuses, two or more vertebrae in the spine. As the vertebrae heal, they become one solid bone. This prevents the vertebrae from moving in a way that compresses or irritates the nerve. Spinal fusion is performed to treat some spinal degenerative conditions and spinal deformities such as scoliosis or kyphosis, as well as broken or unstable vertebrae and conditions including spondylolisthesis. Vertebral Body Tethering Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is a minimally invasive spine surgery to treat children with scoliosis. During this procedure, a surgeon places a flexible cord, or tether, to pull the spine into alignment as the child grows. VBT is one alternative to traditional surgical techniques such as spinal fusion surgery Dedicated Spine and Neurosurgery Operating Rooms Many of our spine surgeries are performed at NYU Langone’s in dedicated spine and neurosurgery operating rooms—which feature the most advanced technology available, including navigation, robotics, intraoperative CT, and MRI scanning—on dedicated neuroscience floors, where all team members specialize in caring for people who have spine conditions. We have Spine Center locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as on Long Island. To make an appointment, call Become a Living Kidney Donor Support the Living Kidney Donor Program Make a monetary donation to support our living kidney donor program. Although the number of patients added to the national kidney transplant waiting list increases each year, the number of available donors stays roughly the same. This means potential kidney recipients must often wait to receive lifesaving care for , a part of the , our doctors perform kidney transplants from living donors. This approach allows for shorter wait times and timely treatment of kidney disease, which can improve the outcomes of recipients. Organ Donation by Living Kidney Donors For living kidney donation, donors provide one of their two kidneys for a transplant. The remaining kidney is fully functioning and ensures that the donor remains healthy and has a good quality of life. Surgical techniques, including minimally invasive kidney removal, have made it easier for family members and others to donate a kidney to a loved one in need. Patient Milissa Rocker Klotz and Dr. Bruce Gelb talk about Milissa’s living donor kidney transplant. There is no financial or medical benefit to donating a kidney. However, many people find helping another person to live longer with a better quality of life and no need for dialysis is incredibly rewarding. Any healthy individual can be a donor, not only immediate family members. Nondirected donation involves donating to a stranger. Paired kidney exchange, also called paired donation, matches incompatible pairs for transplants. These options allow anyone to become a living donor.Our experts complete an extensive evaluation process to minimize the risks to the donor. Benefits of Living Kidney Donation Kidneys from living donors typically last longer in recipients than kidneys from deceased donors. When a kidney is received from a deceased donor, organ transplant surgery must occur within a short timeframe. A living donor kidney provides the recipient with the ability to prepare for surgery. The date of the procedure can be planned around the donor’s schedule, as well as the schedule of the medical team and the recipient. Doctors can also schedule kidney transplant surgery at a time when the kidney recipient is doing well medically. The healthier the recipient is before transplant, the better. We aim to perform transplant early enough in the disease process, before other organs and systems are affected. This allows for a safer procedure, helps with the recovery process, and improves surgical outcomes. Living Kidney Donor Consultation Kidney donor candidates must complete a series of medical examinations and interviews with our transplant team to determine whether they are appropriate candidates for living donation surgery. The consultation may include the following: blood tests to check kidney function and to determine donor blood type and tissue type, which ensures compatibility for a recipient urine tests to help screen for kidney disease and for urinary tract infection imaging tests such as X-rays and MRI or CT scans to check the structure and function of the kidneys evaluation by a cardiologist to ensure any is controlled, an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check the heart’s electrical activity, and a possible echocardiogram, an imaging test to evaluate the heart’s structure and function pulmonary tests to check lung function a meeting with a social worker or psychologist to ensure the donor is prepared for the organ donation process a discussion with a transplant surgeon and nephrologist, which is a kidney specialist a meeting with an independent living donor advocate, who ensures that the donor’s interests are represented When this evaluation is complete, our transplant team meets with the potential donor to discuss test results and candidacy. If the team agrees, the surgery is planned around the donor’s and recipient’s schedules. What to Expect from Kidney Donor Surgery Our doctors are experts in kidney transplantation . For living donor kidney surgery, doctors perform a nephrectomy, which is the surgical removal of a healthy kidney. Surgeons typically use laparoscopy, a minimally invasive approach that requires making a small incision in the lower abdomen. After surgery, the donor may remain in the hospital for a couple days for observation and can typically return to regular activities after six weeks.

Valve Preservation We specialize in preserving aortic valve tissue to ensure longer-lasting valve repair and a return to an active life. Rapid Recovery Most of our patients are out of bed within four hours of open heart surgery and go home within four days. The aorta is the body’s largest and most important artery, supplying blood to the head, neck, arms, chest, and abdominal organs. At NYU Langone’s Aortic Center, our renowned experts bring together decades of expertise to keep your aorta healthy. Our team, which includes cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons, and genetic counselors, offers a complete approach to treating aortic disease. We provide genetic and family screening, medical therapy, specialized imaging surveillance, and the latest approaches to surgery . Our goal is to allow patients to return to a full, active life. Our doctors manage a full array of aortic conditions, including all types of the following: , which is a bulge in the aortic wall , or a life-threatening tear in the aortic wall, which can be caused by an aneurysm in which the aortic valve, the gateway between the largest chamber of the heart and the aorta, stiffens or does not function properly; aortic valve disease includes stenosis, regurgitation, and bicuspid aortic valve disease Other forms of aortic disease that we diagnose and treat include: aortic intramural hematomas, in which blood leaks through the innermost layer of the aortic wall and flows between the inner and outer walls penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers, which cause the formation of plaque that damages the aortic wall connective tissue diseases in which the aorta is sensitive to injury, such as Marfan syndrome , Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Whatever your condition, we offer a personalized care plan that meets your health needs and goals. Comprehensive Work-Up and Expedited Consultations Providers at our Aortic Center offer you a thorough evaluation that includes dedicated aortic disease imaging and visits with our aortic cardiologist, aortic surgeon, and nurse practitioner. We discuss your care options and answer any questions you may have about the treatment process. Aortic aneurysms are often found due to an unrelated procedure or imaging test for patients who do not have any symptoms. Being told you have an aneurysm and need to meet with a surgeon can be overwhelming, so we offer an expedited consultation. At our Aortic Center, we make sure patients are seen within two weeks of referral. We arrange all imaging before your consultation if needed. Experts in Surgery Our cardiothoracic surgeons offer a full array of innovative surgeries for the aorta. These include open procedures, minimally invasive procedures, and a combination of both, known as a hybrid procedure. We are experts at repairing all areas of the aorta to manage aneurysm and offer the latest surgical approaches to treating aortic valve disease. In addition, we offer care to people who were told elsewhere that surgery was not suitable for them. Faster Recovery and Enhanced Rehabilitation Patients we care for get home faster than those who have surgery at other hospitals. The majority of our patients are out of bed within four hours of open heart surgery. We offer enhanced and early physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation to allow patients to recover faster. Surveillance Monitoring When you come to the Aortic Center, we partner with you to provide care after your initial treatment. We work with your cardiologist to build a customized long-term monitoring plan. In addition, we create a schedule for serial imaging scans to monitor your aorta. We also provide guidance on living an active and full lifestyle while also staying safe. Some medications can reduce the risk of a worsening aortic disease. Certain types of aortic dissection may also benefit from medical therapy Genetic Testing Our doctors offer comprehensive evaluations that include genetic testing. Many people are unaware that they have a genetically inherited connective tissue disorder such as Marfan syndrome until they receive testing. If someone is confirmed to have one of these disorders, we adapt our strategy to provide the treatment that is most likely to heal the aneurysm with the least risk of adverse effects. We may also recommend genetic screening for immediate family members. Leaders in Aneurysm Research NYU Langone continues to lead the way in research to find the best treatment for aortic aneurysms, as well as the role growth factors, cellular mechanisms, genetics, and inflammation play in causing aneurysms and other artery diseases.

NYU Langone Experts Perform Complex Aortic Repair Enhancing Vascular Access & Treatment for Vascular Disease Adult ECMO Program We are located at Tisch Hospital and Kimmel Pavilion. Treatment Support When a severe illness or medical procedure affects breathing or heart function, patients might need mechanical circulatory support from medical devices that take over the work of the lungs or heart, allowing them to heal. NYU Langone has received the Platinum Level Center of Excellence Award from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). Mechanical circulatory support, which includes temporary ventricular assist devices , helps the heart circulate blood through the body. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, is a type of mechanical circulatory support device that, in addition to pumping blood, also takes over the work of the lungs. These types of treatments, provided through NYU Langone’s Adult ECMO Program, can last for a few hours or up to a few weeks. Excellence in ECMO and Mechanical Circulatory Support Experts at use mechanical circulatory support devices can be used to treat , heart attack, or acute respiratory failure, often as a temporary therapy before long-term treatment such as a ventricular assist device, ECMO is also used to treat people who have severe, life-threatening COVID-19, and our success rates exceed the national average. In the first two calendar years of the pandemic, our overall survival rate for people on ECMO support was 84 percent. The nationwide average during this time, reported by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, was 48 percent. In recognition of our excellent patient outcomes and survival rates, NYU Langone has received the Platinum Level Center of Excellence Award from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). Specialized Care and Support for Patients and Families Specialized care is provided at by our team of doctors, surgeons, nurses, and perfusionists, the specialists who operate the ECMO machines. Treatment includes surgery to connect mechanical circulatory support devices to blood vessels, as well as ongoing monitoring and care. ECMO care for children is provided through the Pediatric ECMO Program We provide resources to support you and your loved one undergoing treatment, including integrative health programs that promote stress relief, emotional support from our spiritual care team palliative and supportive care to ease the side effects of mechanical circulatory support and ECMO care.

Highly Experienced Surgeons Our team is among the most experienced in New York City, performing over 5,000 repair procedures over the last 40 years. Highly Successful Outcomes We are a Mitral Valve Repair Reference Center, awarded by the American Heart Association for our nearly 100 percent mitral valve repair success rate. Cardiac surgeons at NYU Langone’s Mitral Valve Repair Program are leaders in treating , a condition that can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and, if left untreated, Mitral valve repair reconstructs and reinforces existing parts of the valve so that they close properly. It is safer, has fewer complications, and lasts longer than mitral valve replacement with an artificial or donor valve, which can harden or wear out over time. Dr. Didier F. Loulmet is director of the Robotic Mitral Valve Program. Leaders in Mitral Valve Repair Our surgeons have a nearly 100 percent success rate in using robotically assisted and minimally invasive techniques to repair even the most complex mitral valves. This distinction has earned us recognition as a Mitral Valve Repair Reference Center from the American Heart Association and the Mitral Foundation. Our doctors have performed more than 5,000 mitral valve repair procedures since our program began in 1980, making our surgeons among the most experienced and skilled in the world at mitral valve repair. Both robotically assisted and minimally invasive approaches allow for smaller incisions and a quicker recovery time. People from around the country travel to NYU Langone for minimally invasive and robotic mitral valve repair to treat complex conditions that are often deemed inoperable by other centers. Our long-term clinical follow-up studies have shown that our mitral valve repair techniques restore normal valve function and help our patients achieve lasting symptom relief. As part of NYU Langone’s , we also partner with interventional cardiologists at the , who provide mitral valve repair using MitraClip™. Your doctor helps you decide which mitral valve repair technique is the best treatment for your condition. All of our procedures take place at , which features the latest surgical technology and single-bedded rooms. VIDEO: NYU Langone cardiac surgeons use robotic techniques to treat mitral valve disease. Our doctors are pioneers in robotically assisted mitral valve repair , which requires only five pencil-sized incisions placed between the ribs through the right chest wall. Using robotic instruments and a small camera, your surgeon directs the movements of a surgical robot inside the heart. This allows for a range of motion the human hand is incapable of performing. Our doctors have performed more than 1,000 of these procedures. Robotically assisted mitral valve repair typically involves less blood loss, less pain after surgery, and less chance of infection, and it requires a shorter recovery time than traditional open heart surgery. Most people require only a two- to three-day stay in the hospital, followed by a few weeks of recovery at home. Minimally Invasive Direct Vision Mitral Repair Minimally invasive direct vision mitral valve repair techniques allow our cardiac surgeons to access the heart and valve with only a small incision on the right side of the chest. Miniature surgical tools provide light and magnification that allow the surgeon to repair the valve using direct vision, without the need for X-ray imaging. Our surgeons have used this approach in more than 1,500 mitral valve repair procedures. The average hospital stay is three days, followed by a two- to three-week recovery at home. This technique yields excellent long-term results, with research showing that the repaired valve continues to function well up to 20 years after the initial surgery. Our cardiac surgeons specialize in robotically assisted and minimally invasive mitral valve repair. Didier F. Loulmet Robotic Mitral Valve Repair Program Director Eugene A.

Leaders in Medical and Surgical Care We have treated more than 2,500 people and are the largest and most experienced program in New York. At NYU Langone’s Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program, our heart surgeons and cardiologists are world-renowned leaders in the treatment of people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) , which causes the heart muscle to become thick and stiff, creating obstructions that limit the heart’s ability to pump blood through the body. Our program is led by cardiologist Dr. Mark V. Sherrid and cardiac surgeon Dr. Daniel G. Swistel , who each have more than 40 years of experience and have together treated more than 2,500 people who have HCM. Our team specializes in treatments for people with the most complex and severe forms of HCM. We develop targeted treatment plans that start with finding the right medications to control your symptoms and improve your quality of life, and then move on to surgery when needed. Under the care of our doctors, our patients experience a greatly improved quality of life and can expect to have a normal lifespan. VIDEO: Dr. Mark V. Sherrid, director of NYU Langone's Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program, explains the five-point approach used to diagnosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and create an effective treatment plan. We are innovators in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy surgery . The surgical procedures widely used to treat forms of HCM that involve the mitral valve were developed by Dr. Swistel and are performed regularly by our team. For people with severe disease that does not respond to standard medical and surgical care, we work with the , which is home to the nation’s top Advanced Treatment for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy If it is not treated, HCM can cause and dangerous, irregular heart rhythm, especially during physical exertion. Although infrequent, HCM can lead to ventricular arrhythmia that can cause sudden death. We provide the early diagnosis and targeted symptom management that are vital to managing this condition. Our cardiologists use imaging tests such as electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and to diagnose HCM and understand its impact on the heart. Because HCM can be an inherited condition, we also offer genetic screening, DNA analysis, and counseling for family members who are at increased risk of developing HCM. Treatment for HCM may include medications , surgery, or less invasive treatments, including alcohol septal ablation Innovative Medication Therapy Treatment for HCM includes medications that decrease heart rate and prevent blood clots and abnormal heart rhythms. Dr. Sherrid is an innovator in the use of disopyramide, a medication used to treat obstructive HCM that does not respond to beta blocker therapy. Disopyramide prevents the heart from overcontracting, which occurs in some patients with obstructive HCM. By relaxing the force of each heartbeat, this medication helps to reduce the amount of obstruction and relieve symptoms. For people with nonobstructive HCM, we use other medications including beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics when needed. Our program participates in research into new medications for treatment of obstructive HCM, and select patients might be candidates for these investigational therapies. Septal myectomy is the most common surgery for HCM, and our surgeons have performed more than 600 of these procedures. Septal myectomy reduces obstructions in the heart by thinning the septum, which is the wall between the left and right sides of the heart. For some people with HCM, the heart’s mitral valve is the source of the obstruction. Dr. Swistel specializes in mitral valve treatment for people with HCM, and invented several surgical techniques now used to preserve the mitral valve in people with HCM, including horizontal plication and residual leaflet excision, or ReLex. Both procedures correct complex structural abnormalities in the mitral valve that obstruct blood flow. VIDEO: At NYU Langone's Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program, our team has more than 30 years of experience providing medical and surgical treatment that improves symptoms and reduces the risk of related cardiac disease such as heart failure. In addition, we are one of only two centers in the country that provide surgical treatment for midventricular and apical HCM, which affect different areas of the heart. This procedure reduces a person’s symptoms of heart failure and the need for a future heart transplant. Our team includes cardiac surgeons from the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, who are available to perform a heart transplant when conventional therapies are not adequate to control your symptoms. Minimally Invasive Treatments We also work with electrophysiologists from our , who use cardiac devices such as the implantable cardiac defibrillator and pacemaker to correct irregular heart rhythms. Our electrophysiologists also perform catheter ablation to treat atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. We also work with interventional cardiologists who perform alcohol septal ablation, a minimally invasive procedure that uses highly concentrated alcohol to remove obstructions and improve blood flow. Leaders in HCM Research Our doctors have a long history of participation in research. We participate in clinical trials for medications that relieve symptoms in people with obstructive HCM. Dr. Swistel has led research into novel surgical repairs to the mitral valve for treatment of obstructive HCM. Our research also includes the role of weight loss in HCM treatment, the causes of apical aneurysm in people with HCM, and the role of mitral annular calcification in left ventricular outflow obstruction. Our participation in HCM research allows our patients access to medications and treatments that are not yet widely available. Our cardiologists and heart surgeons are innovators in the treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mark V. Sherrid Daniel G. Swistel Program Surgical Director Joshua A.

Our goal is to individualize care for patients and their families to promote lifelong health and empower them to live their lives to the fullest. As the first program in New York State to be nationally accredited as an Adult Congenital Heart Disease Comprehensive Care Center, we are widely recognized for our commitment and dedication to our patients and our success in providing the highest quality of care to all people with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) We care for people with all forms of ACHD, whether they were diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. Our team partners with experts in the to help people transition to adult treatment. This collaboration allows us to determine the most appropriate treatment path for each person, based on their individual medical history and diagnosis. Expertise in Adult Congenital Heart Disease Treatment We help our patients understand congenital heart disease and its impact on their future cardiac health. There are many types of congenital heart disease, but they all result from defects in the way the heart developed before birth. These abnormalities, which prevent blood from flowing normally through the heart, include atrial and ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, valve regurgitation or stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, Ebstein anomaly, anomalous coronary arteries, anomalous pulmonary veins, transposition of the great arteries, Fontan circulation, and Eisenmenger syndrome. Managing Adult Congenital Heart Disease Our cardiac experts provide ongoing monitoring of congenital heart defects and help manage the risk of long-term complications. Learn About Our Treatment Approach Congenital heart disease can also lead to secondary conditions, including valve disease, arrhythmias, , pulmonary hypertension, and liver disease. For people who need procedures to improve or correct previous interventions, or surgery to treat new complications, we coordinate with NYU Langone’s congenital cardiothoracic surgeons. Treatments for these conditions include that maintain heart rhythm and manage heart failure, catheter-based treatments to repair valves and correct abnormal heart rhythm, implanted devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators, and surgery to repair defects in the heart and its vessels. When these treatments are no longer enough to maintain healthy cardiac function, we work with the team at to prepare you for a successful transplant and recovery. Maintaining Heart Health We encourage anyone treated for heart disease in childhood to schedule a visit with our adult congenital cardiologists. Even if it’s been years since you had surgery and have no current symptoms, you benefit from regular monitoring to prevent future complications. Pregnancy and Congenital Heart Disease People with congenital heart disease should see an adult congenital cardiologist when considering pregnancy or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Pregnancy can present additional risks for those with a congenital heart defect. We partner with experts in maternal–fetal medicine to provide medical guidance and treatment before, during, and after pregnancy. Transitioning to Adult Care Many of our patients come to us through NYU Langone’s Congenital Heart Transition Program , where we help teenagers move to adult care. We understand that you have a long and personal relationship with your pediatric cardiology team, and we work closely with them to understand your treatment plan and consult on future treatment. We also foster the same long-term relationships with our patients, getting to know you personally and providing care that is aligned with your health goals and future plans.

Ultrasound is a real-time imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to evaluate tissues and organs throughout the body. This type of imaging is known to be safer than because it does not use ionizing radiation. At NYU Langone, our subspecialized expert radiologists offer abdominal ultrasounds of organs including: babies in the womb bowel and appendix female pelvic ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries in a variety of situations, including pain, abnormal bleeding, and irregular menstruation gallbladder kidneys male pelvic ultrasound of the bladder and prostate musculoskeletal ultrasound of soft tissue within and around your joints including muscles, ligaments, and tendons spleen ultrasounds of newborns and children, including evaluations of the abdomen, pelvis, brain, spine, and hips Preparing for an Ultrasound Preparation for your ultrasound depends on the type of exam—our scheduling associate reviews this with you when you schedule your appointment. Some ultrasounds require fasting for several hours before the study. You should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to your exam. Certain exams may require you to wear a gown, which we provide. We have private dressing rooms with lockers for your clothes and valuables, although we suggest you leave your valuables at home if possible. Bring your prescription, insurance card, and any related insurance forms or pre-approvals. Please bring previous imaging study results, such as X-ray, ultrasound, MRI scans, and CT scans, including reports, films, or CD-ROMs, if available and related to your ultrasound examination. When you schedule your appointment, our scheduling associate lets you know how early to arrive. Depending on the type of exam, this may be 30 to 60 minutes before your scheduled appointment. This allows time for registration and to complete all necessary paperwork, forms, and questionnaires. During an Ultrasound Ultrasound examinations are performed by one of our highly trained staff of sonologists or board-certified radiologists at NYU Langone. During the exam, you lie on a table or sit in a chair in one of our dedicated ultrasound rooms. First, a clear gel is applied to the area of interest, which improves the image quality of the study. Then the sonologist places an ultrasound transducer on the area of interest and saves important images. The sonologist often reviews his or her findings with the radiologist, who may do additional imaging to guarantee a complete study. A written report is sent to your referring doctor. Copies of this report should be available at your referring doctor’s office. If fluid was aspirated or a mass was biopsied, the samples are sent to our laboratory for analysis. These results are also sent to your doctor. After an Ultrasound If you are scheduled for a diagnostic study and no needles are used, then you should be able to leave without assistance immediately after the study is completed, and resume your regular daily activities without limitation. If you undergo an interventional or therapeutic ultrasound that entails an injection, aspiration, or biopsy, you are monitored for a short time after the study is completed by one of our nurses. You should be able to leave our department without assistance, although this may vary depending on the procedure you undergo. You should be able to resume your regular daily activities within one to two days. Your final instructions are given to you, including an information sheet with clear directions, at the time of your ultrasound.

Understanding Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Of the 6.7 million annual cases of that occur in the United States, HFpEF accounts for nearly half. By 2030, these cases are expected to go up to 8.3 million. People with HFpEF are at high risk of being hospitalized both for cardiac and non-cardiac causes. The prevalence of HFpEF is higher in women than in men, and risk increases with age. When we talk about heart failure, we often refer to ejection fraction. This is a measure of how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. In the case of HFpEF, the ejection fraction is normal, which means the heart is pumping as it should. However, the heart muscle becomes thicker and stiffer, making it hard for the heart to relax. HFpEF may present with the following symptoms: abdominal swelling exercise intolerance fatigue shortness of breath, while upright or lying flat swelling in the lower extremities Our Comprehensive Approach , we provide comprehensive, evidence-based care for people with HFpEF. Our approach focuses on improving your symptoms, enhancing your quality of life, and minimizing the need for hospital visits. To ensure you receive the most individualized and effective care, our diverse team of experts includes pulmonologists, pulmonary hypertension specialists, weight management experts, endocrinologists, nephrologists, and cardiology subspecialists including electrophysiologists and interventional cardiologists. We also offer a dedicated program that helps people with HFpEF participate in ongoing clinical trials and research studies for novel treatments and devices. We specialize in diagnosing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and collaborate with a diverse team of experts to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.

Surgeons from have performed more than 1,200 procedures to date, including mitral valve repair , cardiac tumor removal, and Robotically assisted heart surgery is performed through five small incisions placed between the ribs on the side of the chest. Your doctor uses the incisions to guide small surgical tools and a high-definition camera into the chest. A robotic approach allows for a quicker, easier recovery because there is less blood loss, less scarring, less pain, and a lower risk of infection than traditional surgical techniques. Robotic Mitral Valve Repair Techniques Cardiac surgeons at NYU Langone’s are worldwide leaders in robotic mitral valve repair, which is a procedure to repair a valve that has been weakened by mitral valve disease. VIDEO: Robotic mitral valve repair Robotic Cardiac Tumor Removal Robotically assisted surgery can be used to treat cardiac tumors, also known as myxoma. Most cardiac tumors are small, non-cancerous, and do not cause symptoms. However they have to be removed because they can grow and affect how blood flows through the heart and lead to . Using a robotic approach to tumor removal allows for an extremely precise excision technique that targets all of the existing tumor cells without the need for open heart surgery. Robotic Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Our surgeons have made great strides in improving minimally invasive approaches to , including robotically assisted procedures. Our robotic cardiac surgeons partner with our interventional cardiologists to perform a hybrid procedure that combines noninvasive angioplasty, used to open blocked arteries, with a minimally invasive coronary bypass procedure. VIDEO: When Jay Potter was diagnosed with a severe heart murmur, Dr. Didier Loulmet treated him using minimally invasive robotic heart surgery. This approach restores blood flow to a patient’s heart through previously clogged arteries without having to cut through the chest bone or place the patient on a heart–lung machine. Our robotic surgical team includes Dr. Didier F. Loulmet Dr. Eugene A. Grossi Dr. Loulmet performed, along with Professor Alain Carpentier, the first robotic mitral valve repair procedure in 1998. He also performed the first totally endoscopic robotic coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He is a pioneer in the development of robotic cardiac procedures. Dr. Grossi is a leader in the development of minimally invasive mitral valve repair and one of the earliest investigators of robotically assisted mitral valve repair techniques.

Within four and a half hours of the first symptoms, people who have a blood clot in an artery supplying blood to the brain may receive a clot-busting medication , also known as thrombolytic therapy. This is administered through a vein. Our experts from NYU Langone’s can also begin more advanced treatment, such as removal of a brain clot, as needed. Learn more about stroke treatment and outcomes at NYU Langone, which is certified by The Joint Commission as a Comprehensive Stroke Center. Rate of Treatment with Thrombolytic Therapy More people are treated with thrombolytic therapy at NYU Langone when compared with other hospitals as a whole in New York State and other hospitals that are certified as comprehensive stroke centers by The Joint Commission. Time to Treatment with Thrombolytic Therapy For every minute the brain is deprived of blood due to a blockage, 2 million brain cells are lost. Therefore, it is best for patients to receive thrombolytic therapy as quickly as possible—ideally less than 60 minutes after arriving at the emergency room. The average time to treatment for patients at NYU Langone is 35 minutes. Time to Treatment with Clot Retrieval Several randomized trials have demonstrated improved neurological outcomes when patients receive thrombolytic therapy in combination with a clot retrieval procedure , in which the clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain is removed. This is done using a series of catheters that are inserted into an artery with X-ray guidance. It is best to start treatment as soon as possible—ideally less than 90 minutes after arriving at the emergency room. The median time to treatment, meaning an artery is punctured to begin the clot retrieval, at NYU Langone is 71 minutes. Restoration of Blood Flow from a Blockage Successfully removing a blood clot through clot retrieval restores blood flow to the brain. Clinical trials have shown that patients who have blood flow restored have better outcomes and less disability after a stroke. NYU Langone experts have successfully restored blood flow in more patients when compared with other hospitals in  New York State as a whole, and other hospitals certified as comprehensive stroke centers by The Joint Commission. 212-263-7149 Family & Lifestyle Support If you or a relative has been diagnosed with a heart rhythm condition that runs in the family, doctors at NYU Langone’s Inherited Arrhythmia Program can provide treatment and VIDEO: Doctors at the Inherited Arrhythmia Program provide treatment and support for patients and their families. A genetic heart rhythm disorder, also known as an inherited arrhythmia, can be diagnosed at any age. Some people first learn of their condition after experiencing the symptoms of an irregular heartbeat, which include heart palpitations, fainting, and heart attack. Others are diagnosed after genetic testing confirms they carry the same gene that caused a relative’s abnormal heart rhythm. can also be a sign of an inherited arrhythmia, especially in people who do not have coronary artery disease. Our program, part of the , is one of the most established and experienced programs for people with inherited arrhythmias. Our electrophysiologists, genetic counselors, genetic researchers, and nurse practitioners coordinate with teams throughout NYU Langone to ensure you receive the highest level of cardiovascular care. We provide skilled, advanced care for people with all forms of arrhythmia. Diagnosing Inherited Arrhythmia There are many types of inherited arrhythmias, and they generally fall into two categories: channelopathies and cardiomyopathies. Channelopathies are conditions that can lead to potentially life-threatening heart rhythms. The following are some examples of channelopathies: QT-related syndromes, including long or short QT, that trigger arrhythmia when the heart speeds up, such as during emotional stress, exercise, and extreme surprise, or during sleep when the heart rate slows Brugada syndrome, in which arrhythmia is typically triggered during sleep or rest catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which causes abnormally fast and irregular heart rhythm in response to physical activity such as exercise or sports idiopathic ventricular fibrillation that occurs spontaneously and has no known cause Cardiomyopathies, including , arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), and dilated cardiomyopathy, cause the heart muscle to thicken or dilate and be less effective at pumping blood through the body. Many times, the first presentation of a cardiomyopathy is an abnormal heart rhythm. Proper diagnosis of inherited heart disorders requires clinical expertise, skilled imaging technology, and advanced genetic testing. After we identify the genetic cause of your condition, we determine the best treatment based on your symptoms, age, and lifestyle. Treatment for Inherited Arrhythmia After you are diagnosed with an inherited arrhythmia, our team determines the treatment best suited for your particular type. For some, lifestyle changes, medication, and routine follow-up appointments are sufficient to maintain heart health. Others require intervention such as a catheter ablation, in which heat is used to eliminate cells in the heart that are triggering an abnormal heart rhythm, or an implantable device. This can be a pacemaker, through which gentle electrical pulses are used to maintain regular heart rhythm, or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, which instantly delivers a dose of electric current to revert the heart to normal rhythm and may be required for protection against sudden cardiac arrest. If your condition is best treated with a , we coordinate with specialists at NYU Langone’s Our team of electrophysiologists and genetic specialists pinpoint the cause of your arrhythmia and provide the necessary treatment.

What is the link between cholesterol and heart disease? Many years of scientific studies have shown a close relationship between cardiovascular disease and cholesterol levels. Your doctor may request a lipid profile—a test that shows the levels of LDL (bad cholesterol), HDL (good cholesterol), and triglycerides in your blood—to assess your risk for developing If my body makes its own cholesterol, why does my diet matter? When we measure cholesterol levels in your blood, what we see is a combination of what your body makes and what you eat. Because you cannot control how much cholesterol your body produces, other than with medications, restricting saturated fat in your diet can have a major impact on lowering your cholesterol. Should I focus on lowering my dietary cholesterol or saturated fat? Limiting saturated and trans fats in your diet has the biggest impact on lowering your cholesterol. Restricting fatty meats, choosing low-fat or nonfat dairy products, and avoiding butter and margarine play a major role in helping to maintain healthy cholesterol levels. In addition, a diet high in fiber, particularly soluble fiber, can lower cholesterol levels significantly. Weight loss also can be an important part of your overall strategy to lower your cholesterol, including triglycerides, which should stay low, too. If my cholesterol is less than 200mg/dl, should I worry about heart disease? Even though you have low total cholesterol levels you can still be at an increased risk for heart disease, especially if you have a family history of vascular disease that begins at an early age. Your risk also increases if you have metabolic syndrome, which is defined by having three or more of the following: abdominal obesity, meaning your waist is more than 40 inches for men or 34 inches for women blood pressure over 130/85 triglycerides over 150 HDL less than 50 in a woman or less than 40 in a man high blood sugar levels Can taking fish oil capsules lower my cholesterol? No. Fish oil has the ability to lower triglycerides, but not LDL cholesterol. However, there may be other potentially protective effects from fish oil, such as making your blood less likely to clot. After you have a heart attack, is it too late to benefit from cholesterol-lowering drugs? No, it’s never too late to benefit from cholesterol-lowering drugs. After you’ve had a heart attack, using cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins may significantly lower your chances of having another heart attack or . If you have not had a heart attack, but are at increased risk of heart disease or show early evidence of plaque in your arteries, a cholesterol-lowering drug may help prevent a heart attack or stroke. If I don't smoke and my cholesterol is within normal limits, what impact does my family history of heart attack have on my risk? Having a family history of a first-degree relative—your mother, father, or sibling—with a heart attack before age 55 for a man or 65 for a woman is a major risk factor for developing heart disease and stroke. Keep in mind that low cholesterol levels may not be what they seem—low HDL, the “protective” cholesterol, may keep your overall levels down, but that is not beneficial. Other factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking are also of significant importance to those with a family history of heart disease. If I am on a statin, should I worry about a high-fat diet? Yes. Although statins lower your cholesterol and reduce your risk of a heart attack, studies have shown that the amount of saturated fat you eat correlates with the progression of plaque buildup in your arteries, which can cause a heart attack or stroke. There is also evidence that high fat levels in your blood after eating a meal high in saturated fat can interfere with some of the protective function of the cells that line your arteries. Should I worry about possible liver damage from taking statin medications? The frequency of liver problems with statin therapy is actually quite low. Less than 1 percent of people have to stop taking statins because they develop liver problems. Long-term trials have confirmed the safety of statins—the latest guidelines do not suggest a need to monitor people on statins who have normal liver function. In addition, in some cases where there is evidence of fat deposits in the liver, statin therapy may actually improve liver function tests. Doctors at the Postpartum Cardiovascular Health Program use early detection to identify people who are at high risk of developing hypertension , heart disease, and after childbirth. Make an Appointment To make an appointment with the Postpartum Cardiovascular Health Program, please call Your chance of developing a cardiovascular condition rises after having a high-risk . A high-risk pregnancy can include complications such as gestational diabetes , high blood pressure, or preeclampsia. Our preventive cardiologists and maternal–fetal medicine doctors can create a care plan for you that uses prevention strategies and personalized treatments to support your heart health after pregnancy. High-Risk Pregnancy and Cardiovascular Risk After Childbirth Pregnancy offers insights into a person’s long-term cardiovascular health. Despite having no other risk factors for heart disease, people who are pregnant and have complications are at a higher risk of developing postpartum cardiovascular disease. U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Hospitals” ranks NYU Langone among the top 20 hospitals in the nation for obstetrics and gynecology and the No. 2 hospital in the nation for cardiology and heart surgery. In the United States, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death during pregnancy and following childbirth. Between 10 and 15 percent of pregnancies have at least one complication linked to developing heart disease after childbirth. High blood pressure alone during pregnancy puts a person at increased risk for chronic high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions during the postpartum period and at an earlier age than expected. These complications can arise within a decade of having a baby. These risks are even higher in Black people, and our doctors are committed to creating a supportive care environment to address these challenges. Personalized Cardiovascular Care After Pregnancy At the Postpartum Cardiovascular Health Program, our doctors develop a personalized treatment plan to support your heart health after pregnancy. Patients are referred to our program three months after delivering a baby. At this point, elevated cholesterol, increased blood volume, and other biological factors unique to pregnancy are no longer present. Our doctors monitor and manage high blood pressure and lipid disorders, such as high cholesterol , that contribute to early and stroke. We also treat postpartum cardiomyopathy, or weakening of the heart muscle, which is a rare complication that can develop in the last month of pregnancy and up to five months after delivery. Our care plans for postpartum cardiovascular conditions may include the following strategies: stress reduction weight management nutritional counseling physical activity getting enough sleep taking medication If you are planning to conceive again, we offer consultations beforehand to optimize your cardiovascular health. In addition, we partner with doctors at NYU Langone’s Cardio-Obstetrics Program to provide education about heart health and create preventive care plans for people who are currently pregnant or want to become pregnant for the first time. To make an appointment with a provider at the Postpartum Cardiovascular Health Program, please call The care team from the Cardio-Rheumatology Program helps people who are living with and rheumatic conditions lower their risk of , heart attack, and U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Hospitals” ranks NYU Langone among the top 10 hospitals in the nation for rheumatology. Psoriasis, an autoimmune condition that affects the skin, and rheumatic conditions such as psoriatic arthritis rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus can lead to inflammation throughout the body, including the cardiovascular system. This inflammation can contribute to , abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, called atherosclerosis. As plaque forms, these vessels narrow, increasing a person’s cardiovascular risk. Doctors from the Cardio-Rheumatology Program, part of the , provide personalized risk assessments and encourage evaluation even for people who believe they are too young to develop heart disease. People with psoriasis and rheumatic conditions can have up to a five-fold increased risk of heart disease compared to people without these diseases, and they tend to develop atherosclerosis at earlier ages than the general population. During your cardiovascular risk assessment, we perform cholesterol blood pressure blood sugar testing and, when needed, cardiac imaging. This includes carotid artery ultrasound cardiac calcium scoring to evaluate plaque buildup in the carotid and coronary arteries, respectively. We also talk with you about your lifestyle, including the role and exercise play in improving your heart health. Based on our conversations, the testing and imaging results, and understanding of your underlying condition, we develop a plan that is focused on reducing your risk of heart disease. To schedule an appointment at the Cardio-Rheumatology Program, please call us at For general information, please email program director Dr. Michael S. Garshick CVDPrevention@NYULangone.org Prospective and existing suppliers can learn more about conducting business with NYU Langone Health.

If necessary, contractors must contact their employer to seek a medical exemption. NYU Langone reserves the right to review any approved exemption to ensure that we can accommodate that exemption. Any contractor who is not fully vaccinated is required to take a biweekly nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test . If a contractor does not take their biweekly PCR test, they will be removed from the premises. Information for Prospective Suppliers Any payee by NYU Langone is considered a supplier. NYU Langone only pays approved suppliers. Approved suppliers are those companies NYU Langone wishes to do business with that: have completed an electronic New Supplier Application have provided a current Form W-8BEN or W-9 during that process are not under federal indictment or under other financial sanctions If an individual passes the requirements of an independent contractor, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, and is not engaging in services that may be considered employment, he or she may complete an Independent Contractor Questionnaire that will be approved and evaluated by NYU Langone. Payee Registration and Management All suppliers and service providers, also referred to as payees, must be invited to register with PaymentWorks. Existing payees who do not have a PaymentWorks account must request an invitation from their contact at NYU Langone. PaymentWorks invitations are reviewed by the appropriate parties within the organization, which are dependent upon the type of goods or services provided. PaymentWorks registration requires tax ID information, banking information, and any other key data that is necessary to validate the identity of the payee. It is critical that payees complete the registration process accurately and in a timely fashion. PaymentWorks validation specialists review all payee registrations. After registration is approved, payees can manage their account information as needed. For PaymentWorks support, email Support@PaymentWorks.com Terms and Conditions Purchase Orders Even when a contract is signed, NYU Langone requires a purchase order (PO) in order to facilitate payment of invoices. Purchase orders must be referenced on every invoice. Orders for goods and services must be made via PO, or a contract supported by a PO, and placed by our purchasing department. Department personnel may only place orders provided they have a standing PO for services. Purchase Order Acknowledgements NYU Langone requires that suppliers acknowledge POs, including POs for services to be used for billing. Suppliers not having accurate PO numbers will result in delay of processing of invoices and payment. Payment Terms NYU Langone’s standard payment terms are 45 days for new suppliers, unless consideration is offered in the form of contract pricing, in which both consideration and payment terms shall be agreed upon upfront in the contract. It is permissible to have standard payment terms established for a supplier and subsequent contracts, depending on the goods and or services provided, may carry nonstandard payment terms. Vendormate NYU Langone’s supplier credentialing program is a mandatory program designed to ensure the safety of our patients and staff while conducting business with outside companies. This also insures that the companies that NYU Langone does business with are not a risk to the financial well-being of the institution and that NYU Langone Health meets its obligations to the regulatory and compliance laws of the industry. Vendormate is a company that is responsible for gathering, compiling, reviewing, and storing data from suppliers to ensure they meet the criteria to maintain the ability to do business with NYU Langone. We request that all suppliers register with Vendormate. Even if the vendor does not come on site, we request that the vendor register and be compliant with the program, which carries an annual fee, none of which is paid to NYU Langone. Invoices NYU Langone requires goods and services be billed on unique invoices, in a manner that does not lead to duplicate invoicing. The following key fields must be present on an invoice in order for it to be applied to a PO for payment: company name unique invoice/document number invoice date PO number a description of services or the quantity and price of goods delivered remittance address, even required when payment is by Automated Clearing House (ACH) Invoice Submission Invoices, with a PO number referenced, should be submitted electronically. Based upon the anticipated volume of activities, we ask that you either participate in one of our established programs for submitting invoices or that you email PDF images, with each invoice being its own PDF document, to NYU Langone Health at NYULMC@DigiScribe.info . Suppliers should not send invoices to individual departments within the respective organizations or their satellite offices, as that will further delay processing and payments. Payments NYU Langone issues payments for invoices based on vendor net terms, or when applicable, net terms specified in a contract as evident on an NYU Langone-issued PO. In support of go-green initiatives and in an effort to reduce the risk of lost checks, we encourage our vendors to take advantage of electronic payments via the United States American Bankers Association ACH. A remittance notification is emailed for every disbursement detailing the invoices paid on the ACH payment. Environmental and Socially Responsible Procurement NYU Langone prides itself on efforts to be as environmentally and socially responsible as possible. View our full Noninvasive Cardiac Imaging & Testing 212-263-5664 212-263-8461 Our cardiologists at specialize in using two- and three-dimensional echocardiography to diagnose and manage conditions that affect the way blood moves through your heart. We provide care to patients hospitalized for treatment as well as to those being cared for as outpatients. Using these advanced imaging techniques, our cardiologists perform noninvasive and minimally invasive procedures, such as cardiac catheterization and open heart surgery, to diagnose and help manage heart conditions that previously would have required invasive techniques. These conditions include atrial fibrillation congenital heart defects in adults We also provide noninvasive diagnostic testing when you experience symptoms related to coronary heart disease, such as , atherosclerosis, and blood clots. Our specialists at NYU Langone Heart help to manage symptoms related to coronary artery disease. Types of Echocardiography Our cardiologists use three forms of echocardiography: Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), the most common form, is performed by moving a transducer across your chest to create a two- or three-dimensional picture of the beating heart. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is an internal exam performed with mild sedation, in which a scope with a tiny camera at the end is moved down the throat. This provides our doctors with clearer pictures of the aorta and structures at the back of the heart than can be obtained with transthoracic echocardiogram. Stress echocardiography compares pictures of your heart at rest with pictures of your heart after moderate exercise. Echocardiograms are available to both inpatients and outpatients. Additional Noninvasive Cardiac Tests We also provide the following noninvasive cardiac tests: Vascular ultrasound allows doctors to detect blood clots and blockages in the arteries and veins throughout the body, including in the aorta, carotid, and renal arteries, and in vessels in the legs and arms. Holter monitoring is performed by placing on your chest painless electronic leads, which are connected to a monitor you carry for 24 to 48 hours. The monitor collects information about your heart’s electrical activity and can detect conditions affecting the speed and rhythm of your heartbeat. Echocardiogram strain imaging allows doctors to evaluate how well the heart muscle is functioning. It is most commonly performed to monitor heart health in people receiving chemotherapy, as well as in those with cardiomyopathy or heart failure. When performed on an outpatient basis, most echocardiography procedures take about one hour. Because mild sedation is necessary with a transesophageal echocardiogram, this procedure requires an additional two hour recovery time. Our testing facilities have received echocardiography accreditation from the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission and are accredited by the American College of Radiology. Our cardiologists are specially trained in noninvasive cardiac techniques. Edward J. Bernaski John A. Dodson Robert M. Donnino RF Robin S. Freedberg Albert S. Jung Eugene E. Kim AN Ambika C.

Innovation in Heart Disease Care Our doctors lead research into next-generation stent technology and improving our understanding and management of heart disease. Learn About Our Cardiology Research Our researchers continually work to improve how we treat heart diseases, helping us provide the most innovative diagnostic and interventional cardiac catheterization techniques in our laboratory. Our interventional cardiologists provide treatment for the most complex, high-risk blockages. During cardiac catheterization, our specialists guide a long, hollow tube called a catheter through a vessel in the groin or the arm to reach the vessels of the heart. The catheter allows interventional cardiologists to use special tools to look for blocked arteries through a coronary angiogram or other diagnostic tests, and when necessary, perform procedures such as stenting to restore healthy blood flow. Your doctor will discuss with you how to prepare for cardiac catheterization and what to expect during and after the procedure. Based on the diagnosis, your doctor may recommend specific treatment or interventional procedures such as stenting to open blockages. As soon as a diagnosis is made, our doctors explain treatment options to you and begin the interventional procedure. Our Locations We provide cardiac catheterization at the following laboratory locations: in Manhattan We care for patients who are experiencing heart attacks or other cardiac events at the emergency departments at Routine and scheduled catheterizations are coordinated by your referring physician, who helps you make an appointment.

Leading the Nation with Lowest Heart Attack Mortality Family Travel Clinic Prepares College Students for Travel Health Safety Tips for Summer Travel from NYU Winthrop Support During ECMO It can be stressful when your loved one is receiving mechanical circulatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment. ECMO is used after other treatments for the heart and lungs, including medications, extra oxygen, or a mechanical ventilator, have not been enough to help the body heal. ECMO is a heart–lung support device that takes over the work of those organs, so they can heal. Tubing, monitors, and machines are part of the treatment, and your loved one might look different due to swelling related to the treatment. These physical changes usually go away after ECMO treatment is complete. How the ECMO Procedure Works A surgeon threads plastic tubes, called cannulas, through blood vessels in the patient’s neck, chest, or leg, connecting them to the heart. One tube brings blood to the ECMO machine, where it receives oxygen. The other tube returns blood to the body. Often another small tube goes from the mouth or nose to the stomach to provide nutrition to patients who are unable to eat solid food during ECMO care. Throughout treatment, an intensive care unit nurse monitors the patient at all times. Some patients may be unconscious, because they have received a medication that makes them sleep. This reduces the amount of oxygen they need, which helps in the healing process. However, some patients may be able to participate in physical therapy while on ECMO support. Any procedures or tests the patient may need are often done at the bedside. If that is not possible, the ECMO team travels with the patient to ensure their safe care. The amount of time that patients receive ECMO support depends on the extent of their illness. To ease your concerns about ECMO care, we encourage you to participate in daily rounds, where you can meet your loved one’s care team. The care team is made up of highly trained specialists, including doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, and perfusionists, who operate the ECMO machines. Feel free to ask questions and share with us any information you think might be important for your loved one’s care. Supporting Patients and Families During ECMO We encourage you to visit your loved one in accordance with our visitor guidelines . When patients are sleeping, you can still talk to them, play music, or simply sit and be a calming presence. We also offer that ease stress, and guidance from . It is also important to remember to take care of your own needs, making sure you get the rest and proper meals you need to stay healthy and strong during this stressful time. After our medical team transitions your loved one from the treatment, ongoing care is often required, including additional mechanical circulatory support devices or a ventilator to assist the heart and lungs as your loved one regains strength. The length of this process is unique to each person. We encourage you to talk to our medical team for more information. Treatment at the Adult ECMO Program , our team uses mechanical circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to take over the work of a person’s heart and lungs, allowing them to heal. Mechanical circulatory support and ECMO can help treat people experiencing cardiogenic shock related to or heart attack, or acute respiratory failure related to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung failure, pneumonia, or . These types of treatments can last a few hours or for up to a few weeks. Our medical team at transitions patients from the treatment as soon as it is safe to do so. There are two main types of ECMO devices: venoarterial ECMO, which supports both the heart and lungs, and venovenous ECMO, which mainly supports the lungs. A mechanical circulatory support device only supports the heart. ECMO and other support devices are used after other remedies, such as medications, extra oxygen, or a mechanical ventilator, prove insufficient to keep oxygenated blood circulating through the body. These treatments are initiated via a surgical procedure that requires anesthesia. The surgeon places plastic tubes called cannulas into blood vessels in the patient’s neck, chest, or leg. These tubes connect to the heart, transporting blood to the ECMO machine, where it is enriched with oxygen and then returned to the body. ECMO Treatment for Acute Respiratory Failure Venovenous ECMO aids recovery in a person who has severely injured lungs and is experiencing acute respiratory failure. This treatment is most often used to care for people experiencing severe lung infections, such as COVID-19, pneumonia, and influenza; inflammatory diseases of the lung, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome; and severe airway disease conditions, such as status asthmaticus, a severe form of asthma. Our team selects the most appropriate approach for each patient, which can include venovenous ECMO and other treatments. Some people with severe lung disease may benefit from venovenous ECMO before a Mechanical Circulatory Support and ECMO for Cardiogenic Shock During acute heart failure following cardiogenic shock, a mechanical circulatory support device helps the heart function. Our experts may use this device as a temporary treatment that could lead to recovery, a treatment before a long-term device is implanted, such as a ventricular assist device , or as a treatment before a or lung transplant. Devices used by our team include the following: temporary biventricular assist device (BiVAD), to support both of the heart’s ventricles temporary left ventricular assist device, to support the heart’s left ventricle temporary right ventricular assist device, to support the heart’s right ventricle venoarterial ECMO (VA ECMO), to support the lungs and the heart’s two ventricles Our team works with you to select the appropriate device for your particular condition.

Conditions We Manage with Robotic Surgery We treat people who have certain types of cancer, including kidney cancer prostate cancer bladder cancer , ureteral cancer, and adrenal cancer —in collaboration with experts at Experts at NYU Langone’s Robotic Surgery Center also manage benign conditions. These include the following: benign kidney tumors bladder diverticula Conn’s syndrome Cushing syndrome cystocele, or bladder prolapse enterocele, or prolapse of the vagina and intestines after hysterectomy functional adrenal adenoma pelvic organ prolapse , including uterine prolapse renal cyst retroperitoneal fibrosis ureteral stricture ureteropelvic junction obstruction urinary tract reconstruction following cancer surgery Our surgeons have pioneered many of the robotic surgical techniques used to manage these conditions, and we have some of the best outcomes in the world. Our research has been commended by the World Congress of Endourology. Our surgeons have been performing robotic procedures to treat women with urinary incontinence and uterine prolapse for close to a decade, and we’ve taught these techniques to doctors around the world. We perform robotic pelvic organ prolapse repair , a procedure that allows for greater surgical visibility through magnification, which results in more precise movements than with conventional surgical techniques. NYU Langone’s robotic surgery program has one of the largest number of published articles in robotic pyeloplasty and urinary reconstruction procedures in the world. These treatments involve removing a blockage of the ureteropelvic junction—which is where the kidney meets the ureter, a tube that connects the bladder and kidneys—and using robotic surgery to manage ureteral reconstruction. Among the strategies we have developed is the use of tissue from inside a patient’s mouth to rebuild the ureter. We have also developed enhanced imaging techniques using near-infrared fluorescence, known as NIRF, to confirm blood flow to the tissue. Our doctors were the first to perform a robotic-assisted ureterolysis, in which the ureter is freed from surrounding fibrous tissue, and a ureterocalicostomy, which is used rarely to treat people with a refractory proximal ureteral stricture or a ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Leaders in Robotic Surgery Education In addition to caring for patients and performing research, experts at the Robotic Surgery Center are also committed to training robotic surgeons in new techniques. Each year, more than 100 surgeons come to NYU Langone to observe our advanced robotic urologic techniques. The Robotic Surgery Center hosts an annual course in robotic surgery across various disciplines. More than 400 attendees from all over the country as well as 11 countries attend the conference each year. our research and educational programs Robotic surgery for kidney and urinary conditions is performed by the following doctors: Benjamin M. Brucker, MD James F. Borin, MD Frederick A. Gulmi, MD William C. Huang, MD Nirit Rosenblum, MD Samir Taneja, MD James S. Wysock, MD Lee C. Zhao, MD To make an appointment or learn more about our services, call 877-ROBO-NYU ( 877-762-6698 At NYU Langone’s Robotic Surgery Center, our specially trained, highly experienced surgeons are at the forefront of robotic surgery for both benign and cancerous gastrointestinal and digestive diseases. Minimally invasive surgery has long been a cornerstone in the treatment of people who have gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. For certain people, a minimally invasive approach decreases recovery time, so you can move on to the next phase of your care as quickly as possible. Our gastrointestinal surgical oncologists and colorectal surgeons were among the first in the United States to use robotic techniques in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. We work with experts at NYU Langone’s to manage many types of cancer, including bile duct cancer, colorectal cancer esophageal cancer pancreatic cancer , primary peritoneal cancer, and stomach cancer . Other tumors that can be removed with robotic-assisted surgery include tumors of the adrenal gland , spleen, small intestine , and retroperitoneum. Robotic surgery can also be used to manage benign conditions, including the following: achalasia acid reflux, which is also called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD Crohn’s disease diverticulitis esophageal diverticulum fistulas between the colon and bladder fistulas between the rectum and urethra fistulas between the rectum and vagina hiatal hernia rectal prolapse ulcerative colitis Robotic surgery to manage digestive and gastrointestinal conditions is performed by the following doctors: Mitchell A. Bernstein, MD Brian P. Harlin, MD Jamie Levine, MD Josef Shehebar, MD ). Learn more about The gynecologic robotic surgery team at NYU Langone’s Robotic Surgery Center offers procedures for a wide range of conditions, including advanced endometriosis uterine fibroids pelvic pain , and heavy bleeding, as well as cancer-staging procedures. The robotic platform has enabled us to perform various complex procedures, including the removal of large fibroid tumors through tiny incisions. This allows for much speedier recovery, significantly less pain and bleeding, and quicker return to normal activities. We use one of the world’s most experienced advanced MRI imaging programs to maximize outcomes during robotic-assisted treatment of endometriosis. Our goal is to manage the condition and alleviate the pain and suffering of our patients while preserving fertility. In addition, our sophisticated technology allows us to perform “single site” robotic-assisted gynecologic procedures for certain women. This means surgery can be performed through a single incision in the navel that leaves a nearly invisible, hidden scar. Our gynecology robotic surgery team routinely ranks among the highest volume centers in the country. Physicians from around the nation and world travel here to observe our surgeons use the most-advanced techniques and minimally invasive approaches to managing complicated gynecologic conditions including uterine fibroids, endometriosis and gynecologic cancer. Our surgeons collaborate with experts at NYU Langone’s for people who require further cancer treatment after surgery. The gynecologic conditions for which we offer robotic surgery include the following: adenomyosis cancer risk reduction for women at high risk of developing ovarian cancer endometrial cancer chronic pelvic pain endometriosis, through NYU Langone’s Endometriosis Center hysterectomy hysterectomy for rectocele robotic adnexal procedures robotic myomectomy sacrocolpopexy sacrohysteropexy supracervical hysterectomy uterine bleeding uterine prolapse vaginal prolapse after hysterectomy Robotic surgery for female reproductive and sexual health conditions is performed by the following doctors: Robert Berg, MD Leslie R. Boyd, MD Kathy Huang, MD Linda M. Nicoll, MD Bhavana Pothuri, MD Elizabeth Poynor, MD, PhD Ruth Tessler, MD Preparing for Your Catheterization Procedure Interventional cardiologists at NYU Langone’s perform a variety of catheter-based diagnostic and therapeutic treatments, including coronary artery stenting Our doctors use imaging results from an angiogram to diagnose blockages in the heart as well as in the legs and neck. Cardiac catheterization takes place at the . An angiogram, which uses X-ray images to look for blocked blood vessels, is the most common procedure we perform. We use the imaging results from the angiogram to diagnose blockages in the heart as well as in the legs and neck. If a blockage is found, your doctor might use a stent to open up your artery. Stenting is a catheter-based treatment. Our specialists guide a long, hollow tube called a catheter through an artery or vein to the procedure site. The location of the incision depends on the type of procedure you are having. In most cases, you are awake for the procedure and can go home the same day. Here is what you need to know before, during, and after the procedure. Preparing for the Catheterization Procedure Expect a phone call the day before the procedure from a physician assistant or nurse practitioner telling you what to expect the day of your visit, including what time to arrive. Someone must be available to take you home after the procedure, so please arrange for a family member or friend to pick you up. Learn more about our visitor policies and who can accompany you for the procedure. Talk with your doctor about whether you should take your medications in the morning, especially if you are taking blood thinners or anticlotting medicines or if you have . Otherwise, do not eat or drink anything in the morning unless your doctor or nurse tells you to do so. Please bring the following items with you: all medications in their bottles or a list of all medications with dosages insurance card(s) photo identification such as a driver’s license or state identification card It is best to leave all valuables, including money and jewelry, at home. Please tell the admitting nurse if you have , any allergies to medications, or an allergy to or have had a reaction to intravenous (IV) dye. During the Catheterization Procedure When you arrive in the catheterization lab, the nurse may perform a blood test or take you for a chest X-ray. Your doctor places an IV line to deliver any necessary medicine during the procedure. A mild anesthetic is used on the site where the catheter is to be inserted. The procedure should be pain-free. After the Catheterization Procedure After the procedure, you stay in our recovery area for two to eight hours before being discharged. Your doctor bandages the incision site, and you are asked to rest and lie still until a member of your medical team says you are ready to leave. We encourage you to bring reading materials or other activities to keep you busy while you wait. Most people go home the same day, but some procedures require that you be monitored in the hospital overnight. When you are ready to leave, you are given instructions about your medication. This may include new prescriptions that your doctor has given you. You are advised not to lift heavy objects or participate in strenuous activity for two weeks. You can shower the day after the procedure, but please wait one week before taking a bath. You are also told when to follow up with your doctor. Diagnosis & Treatment for Blocked Arteries Our interventional cardiologists use evidence-based diagnostic procedures and techniques to assess blood circulation and look for narrowed or blocked vessels. Depending on the results of these tests and scans, your doctor may recommend an interventional procedure or other therapies to open these blocked arteries and restore normal blood flow. Diagnostic Procedures to Detect Blocked Arteries During cardiac catheterization, our specialists use special tools to look for blocked arteries and, when necessary, perform procedures to restore healthy blood flow. Coronary Angiogram Coronary angiography, also known as a , is a diagnostic test to look for blocked arteries or structural problems in the heart, such as valve disease. This is often done in response to symptoms such as chest pain or abnormal stress test results. During an angiogram, your doctor uses a catheter to introduce a dye into the bloodstream. An X-ray machine detects the dye and creates a series of images that allow your doctor to look for blockages or other abnormalities. Doctors may also perform an angiogram to identify narrowed or blocked arteries in the leg, leading to lower extremity peripheral artery disease, also known as lower extremity arterial disease Other Diagnostic Tests to Detect Heart Disease Doctors in our cardiac catheterization laboratory may also use the following diagnostic tests to detect other forms of heart disease: Right heart catheterization can diagnose high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries using a catheter passed through an artery on the right side of the heart. Hemodynamic assessment is a procedure that checks blood flow and heart function and helps diagnose valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, and , also known as a cardiac shunt. Physiological testing uses specialized wires to measure blood pressure and blood flow across a blockage which can help determine if it needs to be treated. Intravascular imaging, including intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography, allows interventional cardiologists to look for narrowing or blockages of blood vessels and the extent of blockage, which can also help prepare for coronary artery stenting. As soon as a diagnosis is made, our doctors discuss treatment options with you and begin the interventional procedure. Interventional Procedures to Open Blocked Arteries Our interventional cardiology team performs all procedures and techniques to open blocked arteries. We are also known for providing effective therapy for people with complex and complete blockages, including chronic total occlusion (CTO), and those who have been told they are not candidates for treatment at other catheterization laboratories. Coronary artery stenting is a technique used to treat blocked arteries. During the stenting procedure, also known as percutaneous coronary intervention , a tiny incision is made in the wrist or groin, and then a thin catheter is inserted through the incision into the artery.  A balloon catheter is inflated at the location of the blockage, opening the artery and allowing blood to flow normally. This is followed by placement of a stent, which is a medicated, scaffold-like mesh tube that reduces the risk of the blockage recurring. Coronary stenting is also done in emergency situations such as a heart attack. Complex Coronary Interventions Our interventional cardiologists provide treatment for the most complex, high-risk blockages. This includes chronic total occlusion, or CTO, when arteries have been completely blocked for three months or longer, and complex coronary artery disease, meaning heart disease in people who have complex cases or high-risk factors. We use the most-advanced tools and technology to treat challenging blockages, including atherectomy, which uses a small tool to cut through blockages; excimer laser coronary angioplasty, which uses laser mechanisms to break up plaque; and intravascular lithotripsy, which uses shock waves to treat the most-resistant blockages. is a catheter-based treatment for thinning the muscular wall between the heart’s left and right ventricles. This can help improve blood flow from the heart in people with , a condition that causes thickening of the walls of the heart’s main pumping chamber. Peripheral Angioplasty, Atherectomy, and Stenting Our doctors also use catheterization techniques to look for blockages in the peripheral arteries. These blood vessels provide blood flow outside the heart, such as in the legs, intestines, kidney, and neck. The peripheral arteries bring blood to internal organs and extremities. When their blood flow is restricted, the loss of circulation causes pain, sores, and, in some cases, life-threatening conditions. To treat these blockages, our doctors may use techniques such as peripheral angioplasty, where the arteries are stretched with an inflated balloon and a stent may be placed to keep the artery open. Atherectomy, which uses a small rotational tool, is another technique that may be used to remove calcified blockages that are difficult to remove using angioplasty. These techniques are used to treat chronic caused by kidney blockages; erectile dysfunction caused by limited arterial blood flow; carotid artery disease that increases the risk of , which limits circulation in the legs and increases the risk of gangrene, when tissue dies due to lack of oxygen and blood flow. Structural Heart Procedures Doctors in our Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory also perform structural heart procedures in partnership with cardiac surgeons at NYU Langone’s in Manhattan and on . We use catheterization techniques for aortic valve replacement mitral valve repair and replacement , in which our doctors guide a new valve through a catheter to the heart without requiring open surgery. We offer patients 6 months and older the COVID-19 vaccine, including updated boosters. Vaccine Information for Patients NYU Langone offers the COVID-19 vaccine to our patients age 6 months and older. To learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine safety, read our COVID-19 vaccine information for patients Important Vaccine Information and Considerations We ask that you first contact your doctor before making a vaccination appointment if any of these categories apply to you: You had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past. You have a condition that affects your immune system. You are getting radiation therapy or chemotherapy. If you recently had COVID-19, we recommend waiting to receive your next vaccine dose—primary or booster—by about 3 months from when your symptoms started, or if you had no symptoms, when you first received a positive test. This allows your immune system time to recover and fully respond to the vaccine. Please do not schedule a vaccination or come to NYU Langone to be vaccinated if any of the following statements apply to you: You are currently feeling sick. You have an active COVID-19 infection. The CDC provides detailed information about the COVID-19 vaccine . NYU Langone also provides If you have specific questions about the vaccine related to your health, please contact your NYU Langone doctor.

Robotic surgical procedures for benign and malignant head and neck conditions are performed through the mouth. This approach allows doctors to make smaller incisions that are better visualized, more precise, and may heal more quickly and with less pain. This technique also is less likely than open surgery, which is performed through the neck, to affect speech, swallowing, sense of taste, and breathing. Most patients are able to resume eating solid foods immediately after surgery, and most procedures do not require a hospital stay. Robotic surgery is best suited for people who have early head and neck cancer , in which small, visible tumors and lesions are found on the tonsils, base of the tongue, or supraglottic larynx. Robotic techniques are also useful in discovering otherwise invisible malignancies. Doctors can perform surgery on these same areas—the tonsils, base of the tongue, and supraglottic larynx—to correct benign conditions that contribute to snoring and sleep disordered breathing. A robotic approach can also be used when doctors perform epiglottidectomy, simple or extended tonsillectomy, and pharyngectomy. Robotic head and neck surgery is performed by the following experts: Adam Jacobson, MD Michael J. Persky, MD NYU Langone’s Robotic Surgery Center is one of the few sites in the United States that offers robotic thoracic surgery. Physicians from around the nation travel here to observe our surgeons use the newest and most-advanced techniques and minimally invasive approaches to managing complicated airway, breathing, and lung conditions. Conditions we treat include: bronchogenic cysts esophageal duplication cysts lung nodules mediastinal cysts non-small cell lung cancer small cell lung cancer thymus cysts Our robotic lung surgery program has grown from our surgeons’ pioneering work with the minimally invasive thoracic surgical technique known as VATS, or video-assisted thoracic surgery, for lung cancer. In addition, we perform robotic biopsies of suspicious lung nodules to assess whether they are benign or cancerous. Robotic surgery for airway, breathing, and lung conditions is performed by the following doctors: Robert Cerfolio, MD Stephanie H. Chang, MD Travis C. Geraci, MD Amie J.

COVID-19 Testing for Children If you are concerned you may have COVID-19 or want to find out if you had the virus, NYU Langone offers diagnostic and antibody testing through our laboratories. COVID-19 Update Our doctors are available for in-person appointments. If you have questions about whether an office appointment or video visit is the best option for you, please call your doctor’s office. Learn More About Our Safety Measures We also provide COVID-19 diagnostic testing for children . This includes a rapid COVID-19 test, also known as an antigen test, that provides results within 20 minutes and is available at select NYU Langone locations. COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing If you have COVID-19 symptoms—including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell—you can schedule a video visit with your NYU Langone doctor to discuss your symptoms and potentially receive a COVID-19 diagnostic test. You can also schedule a visit to have one of our care providers order the test for you. After you complete your visit, your doctor orders the test, and you can then schedule at one of our testing centers through your account. Our testing centers are located at select outpatient locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island. Please schedule an appointment in order to be tested. Walk-ins are not accepted. For minor medical concerns that need care today, schedule a Virtual Urgent Care video visit to video chat with an NYU Langone Health provider. Schedule a Visit During a test, a clinician uses a nasal swab to take a fluid sample from deep inside your nose. PCR testing detects viral genetic material if it is present in your sample. If you receive your test from NYU Langone, then results are available within one to two business days in your NYU Langone MyChart account, or by calling your doctor’s office. COVID-19 Antibody Testing An antibody test can help determine if you were previously infected with COVID-19 or have produced antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination. The test is conducted by drawing a small amount of blood, which is analyzed for the presence of antibodies—specific proteins made by the immune system in response to an infection or vaccination. An antibody test does not detect the virus itself and is not used to diagnose a current COVID-19 infection. There are many types of antibody tests available, and it is important to know which test should be ordered. These tests look for antibodies to specific virus proteins. If a person has received a COVID-19 vaccine containing the spike (S) protein but has not been infected with the virus, they would have antibodies to only the S protein. If they were infected with the virus, they would have antibodies to the S protein and another called the nucleoprotein, or N. Our laboratory offers tests for antibodies to the S and N proteins. It is not known at this time if having antibodies means a person is immune to the virus, or for how long they may be immune. Not having antibodies does not mean a person was never infected or exposed to the virus.

There were little symptoms that were adding up. I was having headaches and I was feeling tired all the time, but I passed it off as just exhaustion because I was doing a bunch of extracurricular activities like theater and activities that would help me academically. It turned out it was cancer. I ended up at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital, where I initially stayed for over a month. I’m such a family-oriented person, and the family is so close, that it affected a bunch of people. I think definitely it’s something that took a lot of getting used to. I went from being “yay, I’m independent” to “wow, I have to be dependent on all these things and all these people.” Being in the hospital, it was definitely hard, but—even though I was going through this really difficult thing—there was still a positive energy there that I would never expect to get from a hospital. I wasn’t just a patient, I was a person first—and I still had a life. If I was stuck in the room, not doing anything, there were child life specialists and music therapists coming in and doing projects with me, and all that contributed to my mental health and to making sure that I was at a good place, even if my physical health couldn’t make up for that. Sara Damour, Sala Institute Youth Advisory Council Member It really helped that the doctors spoke to me, as opposed to just my parents, because at the end of the day I felt like I was the one who was getting the treatment, I was the one who was receiving the medication, and so I should be spoken to. I’ve been in remission for three years now. For a lot of that time, I’ve been on the Youth Advisory Council—I’m one of the original members. We discuss really important things in our meetings. We teach doctors how to best build relationships with patients. And we talk about things like hospital safety and how to keep people from falling, from our own perspective. I start college soon, where I’ll study to be a social worker. I found I connected with many social workers through the Youth Advisory Council and my time working with Sala Institute. It really changed me, and I want to do that for other kids and families.

The Education Revolution Novel technologies and big data enhance medical practice and education. Building Resilience How Sala specialists help patients and families learn new coping skills. NYU Grossman School of Medicine is prepping practitioners and students for medicine’s tech evolution. “You get an adrenaline rush racing against the clock,” says Alicia Cowley ’15, Res.’18, MBA ’15 (STERN), about how she spent a weekend last May. Dr. Cowley didn’t run a marathon or take a timed exam, however. The hospitalist participated in New York City’s first-ever Digital Health Datathon, hosted by NYU Langone Health. The intense 48-hour competition started by defining and building the new interdisciplinary team for the digital era:  clinicians and data scientists working side by side. Colleagues from NYU Langone, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Google worked in groups. Once the teams were established, providers posed clinical questions that the data scientists turned into computer queries on a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset. Dr. Cowley’s team asked: Do higher daily diuresis (urination) goals decrease ICU patients’ length of stay for heart failure exacerbation? “Our team broke down what the question meant and the variables that led to the diuresis goal,” Dr. Cowley explains. “Then, we came up with assumptions and criteria. The pharmacists chose patients from the dataset based on medications, and the hospitalist physicians utilized admitting diagnoses. Data scientists then wrote queries to input the values we wanted and used statistics to better determine which patients were more ill or less ill.” According to Dr. Cowley, the Datathon was a unique opportunity to develop knowledge and skills at the growing interface between technology and medicine. “I got a 10,000-foot view and started asking why we do something the way we do it, by analyzing massive amounts of patient data,” she says. Diffusing Innovation According to Sarah MacArthur, MD, Res. ’11, ’15, director of digital health innovation for Medical Center Information Technology (MCIT) and the Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science (CHIDS) at NYU Langone, the benefits Dr. Cowley reaped from the Datathon are exactly what NYU Langone aims for when exposing medical professionals and students to data science and digital health. “Physicians increasingly receive diagnosis and management suggestions from automatically triggered clinical decision support tools,” says Dr. MacArthur. “While these suggestions are often enormously helpful, it’s essential to understand how these tools are built to fully appreciate their promise and pitfalls. In medical school and residency, we’re taught how to tear apart a New England Journal of Medicine article, look at its methodology, and understand where it might be flawed—but we haven’t yet been taught how to analyze the new knowledge created by data scientists’ analyses of EHRs.” Enter events like Datathon and, immediately following that event, the NYU Langone Health Tech Symposium supported by MCIT and CHIDS. The symposium provided a survey course on artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare to more than 500 NYU Langone Health clinicians and medical professionals. “At NYU Langone, we’re enormously fortunate to have an abundance of national experts in healthcare delivery design, predictive analytics, and clinical informatics—most dual trained,” Dr. MacArthur notes. “How do we diffuse their knowledge and skills throughout our entire institution? We’re empowering the average physician to partner with data scientists to generate new knowledge and think about it critically.” Understanding Virtual Health The school’s commitment to teaching innovation can also be found in a two-week elective at NYU Grossman School of Medicine that exposes medical students to the burgeoning field of virtual health and empowers them to educate NYU Langone’s leadership about new ideas for potential implementation. As one of the nation’s first electives in virtual health, Telehealth—Technology Transforming Healthcare Delivery introduces undergraduate and graduate medical students to NYU Langone’s current virtual health practices, including video urgent care visits and online follow-up patient appointments for the Medical Weight Management Program. But Dr. MacArthur, who created the course, notes that its core purpose is not merely to observe; ultimately, it’s to help drive a technology-enabled redesign of healthcare delivery. “We give the learners several questions that come straight from administrative leaders, or they may choose their own question—and they present their findings and recommendations directly to hospital leaders,” she says. One such leader, Viraj Lakdawala, MD, clinical associate professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine, medical director of Virtual Urgent Care, and system chief for Emergency Medicine Telehealth at NYU Langone, recalls how his team harnessed information that virtual health elective students shared. “One of the presentations we acted upon was about determining provider competency when it comes to telemedicine visits,” he explains. “Seeing a patient via telemedicine is a much different skill set from seeing a patient in person. We are working with our colleagues in internal medicine who have expertise in using simulations with standardized patients [actors] to develop a program to measure and determine competency in certain core telemedicine skills.” In this way, the virtual health elective ends up benefiting both the student and the institution. Dr. Sarah MacArthur, Res. '11, '15, speaking at the 2019 Health Tech Symposium “The students’ efforts get embedded because they’ve worked on something that the institution would like to understand more deeply,” Dr. MacArthur says. “This is all about novel delivery design. We are driving forward and we want to create new models to generate knowledge.” Advancing the Three-Pronged Mission Although embedding innovation across NYU Langone may sound daunting, Dr. MacArthur frames it clearly through the lens of the institution’s mission. “When I give talks at digital health conferences, I note that our core tripartite mission is still to serve, teach, and discover—but we seek to reimagine it for the digital era,” she explains. “The NYU Langone virtual health program advances how we serve our patients, bringing healthcare to them where they are. The ways we’re trying to reimagine education—through programs like the Datathon, the Health Tech Symposium, and the virtual health elective—impact teaching as well as discovery, since learners create new knowledge that benefits all of us in our work.” To make sure that NYU Langone remains at the forefront of advancing technology across all three prongs of its mission, the institution and MCIT support multiple collaborative endeavors that foster a robust digital health ecosystem: The Institute for Innovations in Medical Education (IIME) is one of the country’s largest medical education innovation groups. It applies the science of education and informatics to transform teaching, learning, evaluation, and assessment at every level of NYU Langone. CHIDS aims to improve patient outcomes by fostering the development of effective, efficient, and patient-centered learning healthcare systems at NYU Langone and nationally. The Digital Design Lab partners with researchers and clinicians to develop digital health innovations, supporting them from early ideation through product creation. NYU Health Tech Connect tracks potentially disruptive trends, technologies, and companies, channeling their assets to drive institutional objectives. While helping various constituents find their place in digital health, Dr. MacArthur also feels strongly that NYU Langone must continue to seek out the best ideas from wherever they originate. “We’re on the brink of the next golden era of medicine,” she says. “As an institution, we’ve worked very hard to build a robust technologic backbone by deploying Epic. While we lead in the nation, complacency is anathema to the NYU Langone spirit, and we have only just begun to unlock the promise that EHRs hold to generate new knowledge, care for patients, and educate. To that end, it’s critical to remain open and awake to what others can teach us, including medical students and the next generation of leaders.” Written by Sarah M. Jackson NYU Grossman School of Medicine is reimagining teaching and learning. As co-director of NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s Educator Community within the Institute for Innovations in Medical Education (IIME), Michael Poles ’92, Res. ’96, PhD, is uniquely positioned to support his fellow faculty and inspire them to embrace, and even help dream up, technology that enhances teaching and learning. He has been actively involved in curriculum reform and understands that NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s curriculum and education methods must respond to and help shape changing times. Dr. Poles is also assistant dean for medical education in the preclinical sciences; associate professor of medicine and of pathology, specializing in gastroenterology; and a popular teacher. He has received medical school awards for both basic science and clinical teaching, including VA Teacher of the Year in 2010 and Gastroenterology Teacher of the Year five times. Grapevine’s Deborah Schupack recently met with him to learn more about how faculty are harnessing technology to innovate in education. Q. When the newly formed IIME put out a call for faculty partners, you were one of the first to reply.  What was your interest? We deliver the vast majority of our education in the classroom, yet there was a yearning to be able to deliver more content in novel and better ways. With the immensity of medical information to teach students, it is increasingly difficult to impart to them all of the facts that they need to know as physicians. In addition, medical knowledge evolves, which makes it more important to teach them to be flexible thinkers, able to adapt to the mercurial nature of science. I became particularly interested in finding an asynchronous way of delivering key information that could supplement classroom teaching, and I turned to IIME and its precursor, the Division of Educational Informatics, to find or develop e-learning modules for this purpose. Dr. Michael Poles '92, Res. 96, co-director of NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Educator Community within the IIME We could facilitate more active learning by “flipping the classroom”—having students access foundational content at home, then engage in group discussions at a higher level in class with an instructor. This change in format promotes a deeper understanding. We believe it is important to get faculty comfortable and engaged in the process of pedagogical and curricular innovation. Most of our faculty themselves have experienced the traditional, didactic method of teaching. They sat in a classroom, people spoke to them about a medical topic, they took notes, and they studied from those notes. Now, we are asking faculty to consider other ways of delivering that content, potentially involving the use of home grown or outside resources. We are not looking to replace faculty—that’s very important to understand. Our faculty are experts in their fields and can deliver content better than any outside resource. Obviously, the primary way our students will continue to learn is from our faculty. But we can also help them by delivering top-quality resources outside the classroom, so the students enter the room with a deeper level of understanding—and we can take our education to the next level. Q. Are the faculty experiencing a culture shift? The best teachers are typically the best learners, who understand that their own education should be a continuous process. As committed lifelong learners, they are well positioned to promote that drive within our students. The best teachers also want to help others improve their teaching ability. We developed the NYU Grossman School of Medicine Educator Community to bring these inspirational faculty together to work collaboratively, push us to imagine new ways forward in education, and promote best practices. You learn about what’s being developed by others within the community to improve education and you think, “Wow, that’s amazing. I can definitely use that to teach my students or trainees.” Our faculty have all these ambitious ideas for teaching and learning that they want to bring to life. If they tap into the Educator Community, we can help them bring an amazing idea to fruition. Q. How are the IIME and the Educator Community using evidence-based innovations to continually improve teaching and learning? We believe that providing individualized performance data is the key to enhancing learner performance in both undergraduate and graduate medical education [GME], in the same way that it is being used to improve the performance of practicing physicians. In GME, we are now increasing our focus on collation of clinical practice data and delivery of that data back to the trainee to identify, in real time, where gaps in knowledge or practice exist, so that we may react more rapidly in performance improvement. The same way that there’s a continuous quality improvement, or CQI, process for everything else in the institution, there’s a CQI process for students, young doctors, and even faculty educators to help them constantly improve. I will provide an example from my specialty, gastroenterology. When we perform colorectal cancer screening using colonoscopy, it is vital that we identify and remove adenomatous colon polyps that have the potential to develop into a cancer. The data suggests that endoscopists should identify these polyps in approximately 25 to 35 percent of all screening exams. In this new world, we keep track of every fellow’s adenomatous polyp detection rate—meaning, in what percentage of patients does the fellow identify an adenomatous polyp that can potentially develop into a cancer? We’ve collected this data for 10 years now, so every fellow knows how many polyps they’re identifying—essentially, how many cancers they’re preventing—compared with the last 10 years’ worth of fellows. In real time, they can explore this, and other performance data, against expectations and against anonymized data from their peers. If they’re far lower than the norm, we can intervene immediately and identify specific steps to improve their performance and make sure they are meeting benchmarks. Just as we are using just-in-time feedback for students and trainees to improve their performance, we’ve started just-in-time evaluation of lecturers in undergraduate medical education. Before this new initiative, faculty wouldn’t get performance feedback until months after their teaching was provided, when it might no longer be relevant. Now we can deliver that performance data in real time. We can provide lecturers feedback before their next lecture in a module, so they can already be thinking about how they can deliver content better and therefore do a better job at teaching the physicians of tomorrow. The best teachers are typically the best learners, who understand that their own education should be a continuous process. As committed lifelong learners, they are well positioned to promote that drive within our students. Dr. Michael Poles Q. What are you hearing from faculty about the feedback? We hear that for many, this is the first time they’ve gotten specific, actionable feedback, and they are incredibly happy about it. Some are a little daunted by the process, since they are not used to being evaluated immediately after they have completed a task. Still, the best teachers are always seeking to improve, and, just as we use feedback to improve our students’ and trainees’ performance, we have to be open to feedback as teachers—because we should all be involved in practice-based learning and improvement. Q. Your son, Jordan, is a medical student here on the accelerated three-year MD pathway in internal medicine. How do innovation and technology play a role in his medical school experience? Like most of his classmates, he has been steeped in technology for his entire life. Anything that we can envision, this generation of students can bring to life using technology. For example, during his preclinical medical education, Jordan felt that he and his classmates could use more opportunities to reason through difficult clinical cases and grow their clinical reasoning skills. So he developed an app that gives learners access to a communal library of clinical scenarios to help them advance their abilities in a low-stakes learning environment. He’s now working on a second app to help learners better understand arterial blood gas analysis and gain more confidence in their interpretation. Today’s students are full of amazing ideas, and more importantly, they know how to harness technology to deliver those ideas. We get the best medical students in the world, and we must continue to advance how we educate them. Q. You’ve been at NYU Langone for your whole career, except for a five-year stint at UCLA to obtain your PhD. What keeps you here? It’s the NYU Langone vortex. You can only stay away for so long before you get drawn back. When I walked back into Bellevue after five years in LA, all the love that I had for this institution came flooding back. It’s not just a place where you come to work and care for patients. It really is home, where everyone feels like family. Taking care of patients in the modern medical environment can be difficult. But it’s that much easier and more rewarding when you know you can count on everyone around you to be committed to excellence and committed to creating a comfortable, supportive environment that allows you to do your best work. That is what epitomizes this place, and I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. Written by Deborah Schupack Announcing a new Campaign for Sala Institute to meet the needs of children and families when they need it most Recently we launched an annual campaign to ensure children and their families receive Sala Institute’s vitally important supportive services and resilience programs at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone. We met up with Nell Shanahan, Sala Campaign Cabinet chair and the parent of a former patient at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital to learn more about the campaign. What is the Sala Campaign and why is it launching now? The Sala Campaign – what I have described as a kind of “shared commitment,” if you will—is really an effort to both sustain and bolster Sala Institute’s important work—work that exists across four primary domains: safety & quality initiatives, partnerships with families, resiliency programs, and support services. So many of these services are not wholly covered by insurance, and they are the services on which patients and families rely for their healing and wellbeing. This is why we are aiming to raise $1.5 million this year. Hopefully more, actually. As for why we need this campaign right now, I think there are three primary reasons, though I could certainly list a dozen, at least! First, there are greater numbers of patients and families coming to Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital than we have seen previously. Second, our patients and families’ needs are far more complex today and the procedures far more involved. And third, given the increasing rates of anxiety and depression in children and families, Sala’s services are more vital now than ever. Nell Shanahan, Sala Campaign Cabinet Chair, with her family. How did you first become acquainted with Sala Institute? Well, it all started when I first met Trudy and Bob Gottesman over 20 years ago, before Sala was even created, but when they were both already very much involved in supporting NYU Langone and the children and families served both in and outside of the hospital. It was a time in my life where I was not as focused on philanthropy as, perhaps, I should have been. My early twenties! My profession and my personal relationships were at the forefront. But that wouldn’t remain the case for long. Trudy was an incredible role model for me, and her work at the hospital had a profound effect on helping me recognize the importance of looking beyond your profession and your family and taking part in giving back and, in a way, seeking to heal the world.  So that’s the background. Fast forward to the founding of Sala almost 10 years ago now, I knew it was an institute I believed in and wanted to commit my time and resources to help. Little did I know then that my six-year-old daughter Hannah would be hospitalized at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital only a few short months after I joined the Sala Circle. She had a seizure in a pool and required monitoring for several days on one of the inpatient units. What was it like to engage with Sala Institute as a parent, as compared to a donor? It was a profound experience, to say the least. Although it was understandably scary for Hannah and pretty overwhelming for me, the services that I knew came from Sala, and the clinicians who had participated in so many of Sala’s programs, created a space for Hannah to find joy in her days and comfort in mine, knowing we were both being held emotionally, so carefully and, in a way, lovingly too. I recall the first morning after our admission when we were waiting for the doctors to round. We were both not quite sure how the day would unfold. We heard a knock and there in the doorway was a child life specialist offering to make some glittery slime with Hannah. You should have seen Hannah’s face! Overjoyed. Later, we turned on the hospital’s TV channel and Hannah had the opportunity to take a ballet lesson from a principal at the New York City Ballet. Later in the day, we walked down the hallway and found a huge interactive board for doodling to your heart’s content. And that was just the first day. Seeing the kind of work happen live and experiencing the support we received by these clinicians and specialists made me realize how much more I wanted to focus my time and attention on the Institute and all it does for children and families. It was then that I accepted the role of the Sala Campaign Cabinet chair. Why should others consider donating what they can to the Sala Campaign? I touched on earlier this idea of what I see as the importance of seeking to heal the world, wherever that piece of the world is. The idea comes from the Jewish tradition and is described as Tikkun Olam- uniting to heal the world. I love the idea that we can each choose to help others heal beyond our own circles. And I think we all have a responsibility to do just that. I love the idea that we can each choose to help others heal beyond our own circles. And I think we all have a responsibility to do just that. Nell Shanahan Sala Campaign Cabinet Chair Support the Campaign for Sala Five tips to help kids and parents feel better during vaccinations. “Will it hurt?” is an age-old question that children ask when getting a shot. Since the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was recently approved for children 5 to 11, care teams at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital have been hearing this question a lot. And teams from Sala Institute have worked hard to make getting this vaccine, and other needles and procedures, as pain free as possible for children. One of the care teams’ priorities is making sure that children are able to successfully manage the experience, says Chris Brown, director, Therapeutic Recreation, Child Life & Creative Arts Therapies, part of Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care. Brown and her team have expertise in providing age-appropriate information and helping to keep children distracted during the procedure. “We always consider what we can do to make the experience positive,” she says. Tucker, age five, is comforted by sitting on his mother’s lap while receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, part of Sala’s Comfort 5 Plan “When you think of going to a hospital, it’s rarely something you look forward to, but when it came to getting my kids vaccinated at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital, the experience couldn’t have been any more pleasant,” says David, who brought his daughter and son to Hassenfeld from their home in Hoboken, NJ, to be vaccinated. Lessening anxiety before it builds The COVID-19 vaccination needle is very thin and the vaccine is given very quickly, but of course, some children still get anxious, says Brown. Anxiety can build while waiting. Since the Vaccine Center is located in the lobby of Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital, Brown and her team use the giant wall mural of Manhattan sights to entertain children, asking them to find different landmarks. Inside the treatment bays where vaccines are administered, kids can play with bubble guns, glitter wands, toys, and other fun items. “They couldn’t wait to get behind the curtain the instant they saw the bubbles floating,” says David. “When all was done, it was the bubbles, the stickers, and the staff’s distractions that they recalled. They seemed to have missed that a needle was used at all.” “Once a child is upset, they usually can’t calm down easily,” says Brown, “so it’s best to distract them and give them an alternative to focus on besides the needle.” Distractions also include counting games and singing, according to Brown, who worked with the nurses in the vaccine center on several techniques. Five steps to maximize comfort Distraction is one technique in the Comfort 5 Plan, a protocol implemented by the Sala team to decrease pain and increase comfort consistently for all pediatric patients during an invasive procedure. The Comfort 5 Plan includes five steps: Partnership with patient/family Positioning the child for comfort Numbing Distraction Sucrose/Breastfeeding When the COVID-19 vaccine was approved for children, Ashley Kydes, MD, medical director of Sala’s Pediatric Pain Management Program, collaborated with the nursing staff on a refresher program on comfort measures while giving an injection. A big part of the process is giving children control, Dr. Kydes says. “A lot of pain and anxiety management rests on letting a child decide how they want to be treated,” she adds “First, we partner with the patient and the family, asking them if there’s anything we can do to make it better for them. “We ask if the child would like to sit on a parent’s or caregiver’s lap, or sit alone,” she says. “We let them decide if they want to be distracted by a toy or a song, and give them the option of what will make it better. Sometimes the parent will help guide them in a decision.” Dr. Kydes also suggests that parents begin preparing children beforehand for any type of shot by discussing the benefits. “Explain that it’ll only pinch for a second, but that the lasting effects will protect them from getting sick and prevent future pain,” she says. The comfort and distraction measures are working, according to the clinicians, who say the COVID-19 vaccine program is going very well. A Manhattan mother says her children had a very good experience getting vaccinated recently at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. “It was an excellent experience with amazing nurses who were kind, caring, and gentle. They provided activities to distract the children that helped pass the time,” she says. “It was great to be scheduled so quickly, easily, and conveniently.” Fetal Diagnosis & Treatment Program We have doctors in New York City and on Long Island. 844-698-4636 Many conditions that can affect the health of your unborn baby can be diagnosed prior to birth, thanks to advances in medical technology.

Learn More About the Congenital Cardiovascular Care Unit Care for Newborns A Clinical Collaboration Helps Mothers & Their Babies Sala partners with NYU Grossman School of Medicine to provide lessons in family-centered care and communications to pediatric residents. Since its inception, has collaborated with the Pediatric Residency Program at NYU Grossman School of Medicine to teach trainees best practices in family-centered care and communication. The cornerstone of this partnership is the Pediatric Residency Communication Curriculum, in which residents benefit from the expertise of both experienced clinicians and Sala’s Patient and Family Faculty members. Patient and Family Faculty are teens or parents of children who are receiving or recently received care at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone. “Effective physician-parent communication skills are foundational in Pediatrics,” says Heather B. Howell, MD, director of the Pediatric Residency Program. “The objective of the communications curriculum program is to provide the residents with tools to optimize their communication skills.” Over 100 pediatric residents have participated in Sala’s Pediatric Residency Communication Curriculum developed in partnership with the Pediatric Residency Program at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Building skills over three years The curriculum’s challenging, real-life scenarios take place over the course of the trainee’s three-year residency. Each scenario involves role-plays with an actor and are observed by an experienced clinician and a family faculty member. “The simulations we provide to residents allows them to learn about and practice family communication in a very hands-on way,” says Rachel Ramsey, MHA, administrative director at Sala Institute. “They receive direct, actionable feedback from Sala Family Faculty members and experienced physicians that they can apply in their everyday interactions with patients and families.” Practicing increasingly difficult conversations In year one, the focus is on learning to deliver relationship-centered care. An actor plays the family member while the resident goes through a simulation disclosing a minor medical error to the family. After the simulation, the resident, actor, family faculty, and physician debrief using Sala’s patient and family-centered core competencies as their guide. In year two, residents learn skills to handle challenging conversations with patients or parents. This time, the simulation involves a baby who is unintentionally not receiving enough food at home. The resident must make the actor parent aware of the child’s failure to thrive while maintaining rapport. Debriefs review how to have conversations with families in challenging circumstances that impact their child’s health and wellbeing. “Recently, I had to tell a mother that her premature infant was not responding to the therapies used to treat his illness. The mother had been suffering and experiencing significant distress,” says Dr. Dr. Jenna Berson, a recent graduate of the Pediatric Residency Program. “I could feel myself wanting to jump in and reassure her, but I was guided by the discussion with the Sala family advisor and spent more time quietly listening to this mother share what she was feeling without offering her blanket statements of reassurance.” In their final year, residents learn to manage difficult conversations in three simulated discussions: expressing concern for the family’s intentional physical harm to a child, a conversation in the emergency room about a possible new cancer diagnosis after what was supposed to be a routine well baby visit, and disclosing a serious medical error. The third year closes with an interactive session co-led by Family Faculty members and the residency program director. Family faculty offer their personal perspectives on doctor-family communication during some of the most pivotal moments in their children’s lives. Lasting impact on graduates “What families shared was often directly applicable to the next conversation I was having with a parent and the feedback has stayed with me during my residency and now into my fellowship,” says Dr. Berson. To date, more than 100 pediatric residents have participated in at least one year of the program, which began in 2019. In June 2022, all 20 graduating residents were the first cohort to experience all three years of the curriculum. Sala Institute provides vital supportive services and resilience programs to children and families and partners with healthcare providers to deliver the safest, highest quality care possible at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone. This powerful combination of services helps children heal and families feel supported. This type of care is absolutely essential, and it is made possible with generous philanthropic support.

You can receive life-changing news, go from healthy to hospital-bound, and make new connections that will stay with you for a lifetime. For me, 2022 was a year I could have never imagined. In February, I was diagnosed with gastric cancer. In March, I had surgery. In the summer, chemo. The winter, immunotherapy. As a PhD student studying epidemiology at NYU School of Global Public Health and research coordinator in NYU Langone Health’s Department of Population Health, I was used to viewing health in terms of statistics and scientific research, so when my diagnosis came in, I was scared about my own health and future—and where I would land among the numbers. The challenges piled up from there, and during each setback and success, I had supporters by my side: my husband and parents, but also my surgeon, my gastroenterologist, my oncologist, nurses, technicians, therapists, and staff in all corners of NYU Langone and its Perlmutter Cancer Center. I found it was the people in my life—old and new—that got me through the toughest moments. It started as heartburn. At least I thought it was. Like most early 30-somethings, I was hopeful Tums and some light diet changes would solve my issues. Everyone gets heartburn. Why would an otherwise healthy young person need to see a doctor about it? But when my heartburn transformed into debilitating stomach pains, my family urged me to seek help. After an emergency room visit and appointments with different doctors, I ended up at NYU Langone with GI specialist Bart Kummer, MD. My first endoscopy revealed a large peptic ulcer. A follow-up uncovered something more drastic: behind the ulcer was a cancerous tumor. From there, Dr. Kummer and a team of other outstanding specialists helped me navigate my immediate future. Paul Oberstein, MD, met with me about my cancer outlook, Elizabeth Fino, MD, consulted with me about my husband’s and my family planning, and Paresh Shah, MD, met with me to discuss my surgery options. About a week after my initial diagnosis, we had a plan in place for my next steps. Mahathi and Dr. Paresh Shah My surgeon became like an uncle to me. From Day 1, I felt very connected to Dr. Paresh Shah. He seemed like an incredibly kind person, and I trusted him immediately. I think that’s critical for a patient, especially for someone who’s never had surgery before in her life. The surgery was no easy task either. Dr. Shah, with the help of a robot, laparoscopically removed 80 percent of my stomach and 100 percent of the tumor. He cared not just about doing the surgery right and doing the surgery well but also about my quality of life after the surgery. It didn’t feel like he was focused only on getting the job done and moving on to the next patient. It felt like he was really invested in me as a patient and my well-being, and my parents felt the same way. My parents were essential to my recovery, and they also built deep connections with my NYU Langone care team. When my dad had three pages of questions following my surgery, Dr. Shah patiently answered every single one and gave my dad time out of his very busy schedule. When I suffered a terrifying episode weeks after the surgery and fainted in the shower, my parents took me all the way from their home in Princeton, New Jersey, where I was recovering, to NYU Langone’s Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services in Manhattan. Everyone stepped up to help me through my journey. Four weeks after surgery and a frightening bout with COVID-19, I received pathology results showing my journey was not yet complete. I needed chemotherapy. Dr. Oberstein at Perlmutter Cancer Center is truly the nicest person that I have ever met. He’s so calm and kind, and I think being an oncologist is the perfect profession for him because when you meet him, your worries just dissipate. They just go away. My bonds within NYU Langone deepened over the next few months. My weekly chemotherapy visits, while exhausting, turned into social meetups with the nurses. I looked forward to seeing the people who cared for me, formed real friendships with them, and even requested to see certain nurses on a regular basis. We connected and got to know each other, and I got the chance to talk about something other than my health, like discussing the latest Beyoncé album with Ginelle and Adiel. I never felt scared or alone there. I always felt like I could ask questions and be heard. I look to the future with hope. A year after receiving my cancer diagnosis, I’m continuing immunotherapy and looking forward with hope and positivity. I faced challenges I certainly hadn’t expected, but after surgery, chemotherapy, and countless visits to NYU Langone’s clinics, I’m trying to resume a part of my old life: completing my PhD, working, spending time with friends and family, and planning to start a family of my own. For me as a researcher, it’s important to know that my doctors are keeping up with the current literature and incorporating the latest innovations into their practice. I could see how much my providers were doing behind the scenes to make sure they were on the front lines of their work. My experience as a patient at NYU Langone has had an impact on my work for my PhD as well: I’ve decided to alter my research topic to focus on adults who smoke cigarettes and vape e-cigarettes with gastric ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastric cancer. I have tremendous gratitude for my new NYU Langone family. I never knew the extent to which my colleagues and community would go to support me as well as the other thousands of people facing cancer in New York. When I asked Dr. Shah what I could do to repay him for his lifesaving care, he simply replied, “I just want you to finish your PhD. Send me a photo of you at graduation. That’s what I want to see.” That’s something my dad would have said to me. The kind of care NYU Langone provides—it really does make you feel like you’re part of the family. Our doctors see patients in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Endometriosis Symptom Questionnaire At NYU Langone’s Endometriosis Center, we understand the profound impact that can have on various aspects of your life. The condition, which occurs when tissue from the uterine lining spreads and attaches to other pelvic areas, goes beyond mere physical discomfort—it can cause profound pelvic pain, especially during menstruation and sexual intercourse. Endometriosis can also impact fertility, sexual health, and overall quality of life. Endometriosis Center Webinar Series Our experts host live webinars on topics related to endometriosis, including pain, fertility, and treatment options. Learn More About Our Webinars At NYU Langone, our team understands these challenges. We know that the success of any treatment plan lies in focusing on you. Our treatment strategies address your symptoms and prioritize your personal health goals. Diagnosing Endometriosis When you first meet with us, we want to learn as much as we can about your medical history, including how long you have experienced symptoms and when they occur. We also perform a targeted physical examination to better understand the source of your pelvic pain. This thorough assessment forms the foundation of your treatment plan. VIDEO: Gynecologist Dr. Kathy Huang talks about her team of medical experts at the Endometriosis Center who specialize in treating women who have endometriosis. In advanced cases, endometriosis can spread to surrounding areas, such as the bowel or bladder. If this is suspected, we may recommend additional diagnostic measures. Our skilled radiologists, who specialize in endometriosis imaging, may conduct an MRI scan or targeted pelvic ultrasound to better understand the best treatment approach, which may include surgery. Our Treatment Approach If you prefer nonsurgical options and are not actively trying to conceive, our specialists can work with you to determine the most suitable medical treatment . This may include oral contraceptives, hormone therapy, and pain medication. When surgical treatment is the best option for relieving your symptoms, you are matched with the surgeon best suited to your treatment needs. Our surgeons use minimally invasive techniques, including laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgical techniques , to remove endometrial growths and scar tissue. These techniques rely on very small incisions, which result in faster recovery time and less discomfort. These procedures can increase the ability to conceive. If endometriosis has spread to surrounding organs, we bring together a team of surgeons who ensure that every aspect of your condition is addressed with expertise and precision. Our commitment is to provide you with a holistic and personalized treatment journey that leads to a reduction or elimination of symptoms, promoting your wellbeing at every step. Recognizing the debilitating impact of pain on both physical and emotional health, we offer advanced pain relief therapies, including nerve blocks and trigger point injections, to alleviate pain and reduce swelling and inflammation. Additionally, we can connect you with who provide rehabilitation therapies to ease pelvic pain. Our Support Programs and Services At NYU Langone, our mental health providers, including our sexual health therapist, address concerns involving intimacy and the emotions that can accompany life with endometriosis. The Leveraging Integrative Health in the Treatment of Endometriosis (LIGHTE) Program offers resources to help you manage the physical and emotional effects of endometriosis treatment. Our weekly meditation group, held in partnership with NYU Langone’s , promotes improved sleep, stress reduction, and overall wellbeing. Patients can also benefit from other integrative health services, including the Mind–Body Patient Bedside Care Program during a hospital stay and outpatient services such as acupuncture treatment. In this free series, our diverse team of experts covers topics such as pain management, fertility, and sexual wellness. Visit NYU Langone’s YouTube channel for an archive of all our videos.

Sadock Psychiatrist 212-545-5400 At age 60, I ran my first marathon for NYU Langone As a palliative care social work manager, it’s my job to reach beyond medicine to comfort people with serious illnesses. I supervise a team of social workers at NYU Langone Health who have dedicated their careers to understanding the needs of patients and giving them fulfilling experiences in the face of health crises. Sometimes it’s a simple gesture like helping a family member with parking. Other times, it’s coordinating a wedding in our hospital so terminally ill parents can see their adult children get married. Our days our often not easy, but having the ability to bring people together during a time of need can be a very beautiful thing. I find it a privilege to be able to enter the lives of patients and families and witness their most tender moments. Over the years, my brother Brian has led a life dedicated to helping others as well. As the executive director for sales for the New England Patriots and a passionate sports fan, Brian started the nonprofit Golf Fights Cancer alongside his longtime friend Jay Monahan, who is now the commissioner of the PGA Tour. Their goal was to harness the philanthropic power of the sports community and raise funds for cancer-related charities in honor of a friend who died from cancer. Brian has run more than 25 Boston Marathons in association with Golf Fights Cancer, fundraising for cancer-based organizations in the Boston area and beyond. At age 60, I thought it was time to start catching up with Brian and decided to run my first marathon in support of NYU Langone’s palliative care team. Doing the hard work with a mission to help When I got the idea to run the Boston Marathon, I knew it was now or never because I’m getting older. After a trip to Boston’s famous Heartbreak Hill early on in my training, I experienced the strain of how difficult this feat would be. There was definitely some heartbreak involved during that day of training, but my brother and I laugh about it now knowing what we ended up achieving. From January to April, I took advantage of the mild winter and ran through the neighborhoods near my new home in Westchester and visited the NYU Langone running clinic to get some tips on how to maximize my potential as a runner. Throughout these months, I also reached out to the people in my life to help with my fundraising goal. The support I got from friends and family was totally overwhelming and heartwarming. Across the board, everyone has been touched by cancer—either themselves or with a family member. It’s a cause so universal that everyone has a story to tell and a personal reason to give. Together, we ended up raising $226,200, a fitting and symbolic number for the race’s 26.2 miles. Across the board, everyone has been touched by cancer—either themselves or with a family member. It’s a cause so universal that everyone has a story to tell and a personal reason to give. The funds raised will help my colleagues on the palliative care team continue to go above and beyond for their patients. A windfall of new possibilities for palliative care There are many services we’ll be able to offer with the funds raised. We can be as creative as possible to provide patients care beyond their expectations. While the marathon was a gut-wrenching multi-hour event, bringing my loved ones together and awarding my team at NYU Langone with the ability to change lives was 100 percent worth it. I’ve still got more than 25 marathons to go to catch up with Brian, but this one meant the world to me—and to the cancer patients in the palliative care unit where an everyday gesture can change one’s outlook forever. Thank you to everyone who helped me and donated to this life-changing work. And if you’ve ever thought about running a marathon in support of a cause that is meaningful to you, go for it! Samara Sweig shares her experience of having twin girls prematurely and how she’s giving back today through Sala Institute In the fall of 2013, Samara Sweig gave birth to twin girls, Tilly and Ivy, at just 28 weeks. During the many weeks that followed, specialists at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital cared for the twins around the clock in the KiDS of NYU Langone Foundation Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and tended to the needs of Samara and Louis, her husband. Today, Tilly and Ivy are thriving—and Samara participates in the Sala Family Advisory Council to pay forward her family’s transformational experience. What was it like to give birth to twins at just 28 weeks? Samara: It was frightening. There were so many unknowns and fears that came along with their birth. We didn’t know if they would be born alive, or if they would be able to breathe, because they were born so early and were so small. It was overwhelming and scary. How did you manage this fear when Tilly and Ivy were brought to the NICU after they were born? For the first 24 hours, I was really afraid to see them. But once I did, as any mother would feel, I wanted to do anything I could for them. In the NICU, babies have so many medical needs that parents can sometimes feel like bystanders. In time and with the help of the NICU staff, my husband and I learned of the different ways that we could participate in their care. I pumped around the clock so they could have Mamma’s milk. We provided them kangaroo care for hours every day. We talked to them, held their hands, and were eventually able to bottle-feed and change them. Samara, Louis and ten-year-old twins, Tilly and Ivy How are Tilly and Ivy doing now? They’re our little miracles. They’re nine years old. They’re fierce, smart, and kind. They’re tall, like their father, and beautiful. They’re strong; Ivy recently completed a 5K run and Tilly just finished the soccer season. They truly amaze us, and I constantly remind them that they can do anything—because they’ve already done the hard part. Babies born at 28 weeks don’t always thrive the way that Tilly and Ivy did, so I count my blessings every day. Receiving the care and support of this amazing children’s hospital was a huge part of their really hard and miraculous journey. The support that we got from the hospital didn’t just end the day that the girls were discharged from the NICU. It continued as we met with an interdisciplinary care team every six months for the first two years to see if they’d need any extra support during those early times. Tell us about the Sala Institute Family Advisory Council. Why did you join and what is your role? After our last visit with the NICU follow-up team eight years ago, the woman running the program told me about the Sala Family Advisory Council and asked if I might be interested in joining. It sounded exactly like something I wanted to do. After spending so much time in a hospital, you have so many thoughts on what worked well and what could have been better. It’s remarkable to be included in an opportunity where feedback from families is sought after with the goal of providing exceptional care to patients and their families. I’ve been a part of the Family Advisory Council for eight years. As council members, we’ve weighed in on unbelievable initiatives and met with the heads of most departments. We’re asked what we think of new projects and we share ideas for how to make them better. This work sounds really unique. It really is. It’s best in class. We’re very fortunate to have this caliber of children’s hospital in the New York area—one that exceeds medical standards and puts children and families at the center of its work thanks to Sala Institute. I thought I had 90 days to live. Now I’m a national powerlifting champion and training for the 2025 Senior Games in pole vault. At 70 years old, I had lived an accomplished life. I was a husband and the father of three, and had a successful career as a New York Times advertising executive. However, many of my greatest feats were yet to come: tackling cancer, dedicating my life to physical fitness, launching a championship-winning weight-lifting career, and becoming a role model for anyone who’s looking to make a change. Over Thanksgiving weekend in 2019, I was diagnosed with stage four liver cancer. I was staying with family in our country home in Upstate New York when I received the diagnosis from a local hospital and quickly made my way to New York City and NYU Langone, where I had long received care. I was shocked and stunned. After some initial research, I assumed I had about 90 days to live. But after a biopsy, NYU Langone oncologist Paul Oberstein, MD, and his team reassured me that the cancer was slow-growing and that I had every chance to live, with the caveat that I must improve my physical health, change my diet, and exercise more. “You don’t have to tell me twice,” I told Dr. Oberstein. “I’m going to be the most physically fit patient you’ve ever seen in your entire life!” What may have seemed like a joke turned into a deeply committed personal declaration. At that point, I wasn’t super active. I had quit smoking 15 years prior, but no one told me the downside of alcohol during my days entertaining international clients in the advertising world! I needed to create a regimen that would improve my fitness and help me beat this disease. From there, I was determined to be as fit as I could possibly be. I started by walking 30 minutes a day. Then I ran. I lifted weights. Then heavier weights. I changed how I ate and virtually quit drinking. I watched hours of YouTube tutorials on abdominal workouts, push-pull-legs workouts, and everything in between. My wife, Juliana, and I built a fully equipped home gym in our three-car garage during COVID to safely work out; our cars became relegated to the driveway. I logged sub-nine-minute mile times and bench-pressed my weight. Then, this past year, after five years of health progress, a minor skin cancer scare, and hours upon hours of working out and getting stronger, I entered the American Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation National Competition. Embodying my rallying cry of being the most physically fit patient ever, I won my age/weight class and was crowned over-75 champion. As Juliana put it, “If we’re going to drive five and a half hours for this, you better win…No pressure!!” Over the course of my health journey, I’ve been lucky to serve as an inspiration to my family and loved ones. My son, Paris, and daughter Tiffany now compete in body-building competitions, and my daughter Caroline has started her fitness program as well. All have developed an affinity for fitness. Having been forced to make changes myself, I now love helping others reach their health goals. “Just move!” I say. No matter your age or your fitness level, you can start with walking and simple exercises like jumping jacks to get on a path to better health. NYU Langone’s care changed my life. Although it took immense self-motivation to become a powerlifting champion, my doctors and nurses were the expert guides I needed to take on cancer. Every time you go into NYU Langone, you feel like you’re somebody special. You feel like people care for you and they bend over backward to give you the best experience they can. Another reason I love my care at NYU Langone is the online MyChart app. I can contact all my doctors, ask questions, make appointments, review all my test results, and check my medications all in one place, online 24/7. I don’t feel like a number or an ID when I’m there. I feel like I’m Paul Perkins, and they’ve done their research; they know who I am. I learned their stories, too, and have been inspired by who my doctors and nurse practitioners are as people. It took a team of healthcare professionals to get my health on course and give me the strength (no pun intended) to achieve my goals. A special thank you to Paul E. Oberstein, MD, Shantal Ginsberg, RN, Zefie Kanos, NP, Kent P. Friedman, MD, and Irvine Lee for my liver cancer treatment; Jennifer Ann Stein, MD, and Maressa C. Criscito, MD, for my skin cancer treatment; Kenneth Vera, MD, my primary care physician; and Gregory M. Katz, MD, for my heart health. Next year, 2025, my goal is to compete in the National Senior Games in powerlifting, as well as the pole vault, long jump, and high jump. My philosophy is to just strengthen my core as much as possible and build my muscles. I will then concentrate on the jumping techniques as I continue to grow the jumping muscles. I think it is important to continuously challenge yourself to keep your interest in exercising at a high level. Set tough goals. In the meantime, I’ll remain close to NYU Langone, getting tests done when needed and keeping my care team in my thoughts as I conquer more fitness challenges and try to inspire more people. Thanks to NYU Langone, I had a wake-up call and the support I needed to transform my life. I learned that when you have a chance to get healthy, you can’t give up. You just have to do it. Just move! We loved understanding what was important to Paul and tailoring his treatment as much as possible to accommodate him achieving his goals . . . On our team, we particularly love connecting with people and knowing things about their personal lives that will guide them accomplishing their goals with therapy. Instead of thinking about how to treat the cancer, we ask, ‘How do we treat the person? Paul E. Oberstein, MD Service Chief, Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology Program Celebrate the FACES Community Date Location FACES (Finding A Cure for Epilepsy and Seizures) and the NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center are incredibly grateful for the tremendous generosity displayed for FACES Gala 2024. The evening was a testament to the resilience and unity of the FACES community, including individuals with epilepsy, their families and friends, volunteers, physicians, and researchers. The remarkable success of the gala is a testament to the collective efforts of attendees, donors, sponsors, auction participants, and volunteers, numbering over 700 strong. Together, we raised an impressive $5.5 million! These funds will directly benefit innovative research, enhance patient care, and bolster vital programs that ease the challenges faced by epilepsy patients and their families. They will support initiatives such as the Parent Network, FACES Apartments, Dr. Blanca Vazquez Summer Camp Scholarship, and FACES College Scholarship, along with offering annual free events like Game Day, the Peace of Mind Lecture series, and the Epilepsy Conference. Our sincerest gratitude goes to the whole FACES community for their unwavering commitment in advancing our shared mission.

D10 Training Camp 2024 brings together an invite-only audience of investors, operators, and policymakers. These “teams of rivals” come together for spirited, athletic competition and debate, catalyzed by a collective goal to accelerate clinical trials at NYU Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center that could transform the way cancer is treated. D10 Training Camp’s curated community uses its collective resources to support researchers on the front lines of new cancer therapy innovations. Although its name and format have evolved, D10’s mission remains the same; to fund early stage clinical trials with lifesaving potential. One hundred percent of funds raised support investigator-initiated trials (IITs) for cancer therapies. These early-stage studies rely on philanthropic funding to bring new and exciting ideas to the testing phase. D10 Training Camp’s participants make a real impact by providing researchers with critical resources to take these potentially revolutionary treatments from the lab to patients. communitygiving@nyulangone.org.

We offer rapid COVID-19 testing, also known as antigen testing, for symptomatic children at certain NYU Langone pediatric care locations. With this option, your child can be tested quickly in the comfort and safety of a pediatrician’s office. This test is performed by using a nasal swab, and results are generally available within 20 minutes. Symptomatic infants and children of all ages may receive this test. COVID-19 symptoms  in children include fever or chills, cough, congestion or runny nose, loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, body aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat, and nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. If your child is exhibiting any of these symptoms, please contact your child’s pediatrician to determine if an in-office visit for rapid COVID-19 antigen testing is recommended. Because COVID-19 has many of the same symptoms as the , your child’s doctor may also recommend rapid flu testing. NYU Langone offers patients 6 months and older the , including updated boosters. Here are answers to some of your questions about the safety of the vaccine, how it works, and who should get vaccinated and why. Who is eligible for an updated COVID-19 vaccine? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone age 6 years and older receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine regardless of whether they received the vaccine previously. The updated monovalent vaccines from Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna protect against currently circulating strains of the COVID-19 virus. Children ages 6 months to 5 years of age may need one or two doses to be up to date on their recommended vaccines, depending on the number of doses and the original vaccine they received. The CDC provides information about staying up to date on COVID-19 vaccines and boosters Why do healthy people need to be vaccinated? Even healthy people are at risk of severe COVID-19 infection and can develop serious complications. Although healthy people are less likely to be hospitalized than those with certain underlying medical conditions, they can become severely ill and are as likely to experience long-term health effects after the initial infection. This is known in the medical community as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), or as “long-haul COVID.” When healthy people are vaccinated, they help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by limiting the virus’s opportunity to spread from person to person. Vaccination is also a way that healthy people can protect people who are at high risk for complications from contracting COVID-19. By getting vaccinated, you are protecting yourself, your family, and your community by helping control the spread of the disease. Should children get vaccinated against COVID-19? The Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are approved for use in children and infants as young as 6 months. Compared to other age groups, the rates of severe illness and hospitalization from COVID-19 are lower in people under age 18, but COVID-19 infection at any age can result in hospitalization, inflammatory conditions, and long-term side effects. Clinical trials showed the COVID-19 vaccine to be as effective in children as in adults in reducing infections, and more importantly, preventing the risk of hospitalization. Can pregnant or breastfeeding people get the COVID-19 vaccine? Along with the CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine recommend that all pregnant and breastfeeding people receive the COVID-19 vaccine and booster. Tens of thousands of people have received the vaccine while pregnant. The data show there are no safety risks and that vaccination reduces the risk of severe maternal COVID-19 and preterm delivery. The vaccine also appears to be just as effective for pregnant people as it is for the general population. This is especially important because pregnant individuals are at high risk of severe complications should they become infected with COVID-19. Vaccination before or during pregnancy can also protect your baby after birth , as the mother’s antibodies pass on to the infant while in utero. We recommend that people who are pregnant or breastfeeding talk with their obstetricians about any concerns they have regarding vaccination. Will the COVID-19 vaccine affect fertility? There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine affects fertility in women or men. There is no data to support the belief that the vaccine or the resulting immune reaction has any effect on conception, fetal development, or miscarriage risk. If the spike protein antibody created by the vaccine caused infertility, an infection with COVID-19 should also, and there is no evidence that it does. Talk with your doctor about any concerns you have about the vaccine and future family planning. How can I be sure the vaccine is safe? More than 80 percent of all Americans have already received the COVID-19 vaccine, with more than 56 million people receiving at least one bivalent booster dose. NYU Langone has been involved in testing COVID-19 vaccines through clinical trials at our , which is 1 of 10 Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units in the United States funded by the National Institutes of Health. (The Vaccine Center is a research center and is not involved in giving vaccines to the general public.) The FDA reviewed data from those extensive clinical trials, which showed that the vaccine is safe and that its benefits outweigh its known or potential risks. Three vaccines—Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen—have received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, which is a special approval during a public health emergency that is based on strong evidence of safety. The Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine has been granted full FDA approval for use in people age 12 and older. The FDA granted full approval for the Moderna vaccine in people age 18 and older. Full approval is based on updated data from the initial clinical trials, including research into long-term side effects. The Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for use in children continue to be distributed under Emergency Use Authorization. Vaccines work by priming the body’s immune system to fight the virus. Vaccine reactions, such as a sore arm, headache, fatigue, or nausea, are normal and are signs that the body is responding to the vaccine. We encourage you to talk with your doctor about any questions or concerns you have about the vaccine, so you can make an informed decision. If vaccinated people can still get COVID-19, does that mean that the vaccines are ineffective? COVID-19 infections do occur in fully vaccinated people. However, fully vaccinated people with infections tend to experience much milder symptoms or no symptoms at all, and the vaccines continue to provide strong protection against severe disease that can lead to hospitalization and death. Hospitalization and death rates for fully vaccinated people remain exceedingly low. Can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine? No, you cannot get COVID-19 from any of the COVID-19 vaccines because they do not contain elements capable of making you sick. There are two types of COVID-19 vaccines currently available: messenger RNA (mRNA) and viral vector vaccines. The Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use mRNA to send a message to the cells on how to make a certain harmless spike protein that is unique to the virus that causes COVID-19. With those vaccines, your cells use the mRNA information to create a unique spike protein that is found on the surface of the coronavirus. The protein cannot make you sick on its own. But it plays an important role: it introduces your immune system to a protein that it has never seen before, and gives it the opportunity to create antibodies against it. This way, if your body is ever confronted by the actual coronavirus, your immune system already knows which antibodies it needs to kill the virus and protect you from illness. Are there any reasons a person should not get vaccinated? There are no diagnoses or conditions that prohibit a person from being vaccinated, but certain people should consult with their doctor before getting the vaccine. This includes the following groups: people with a history of a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine people who have a condition that affects their immune system people who are getting radiation therapy or chemotherapy If you are in any of these groups, talk with your doctor before making a vaccination appointment. Meet Renaissance man Jeffrey Gurian, DDS. He’s worked with every standup comic you know. He’s also helping the pandemic’s front lines after a hospital stay from COVID-19 double pneumonia. How are you feeling? It’s seven weeks, and I’m just feeling back to myself. That’s how hard it hit me. Much worse than my heart attack—I had what’s known as a widow maker, had a stent put in—I was back on stage in five days. This feels like I was beaten over every part of my body. What happened? I started to have full body pains, every place you could image. Nausea, from morning to night, no matter what I took. At first, I wasn’t sure if I had fever or not because, foolishly, I had what must have been one of the first thermometers ever invented. Something my great-grandmother might have used in Russia. But at one point, my chills were so bad I couldn’t hold a glass. My doctor told me I should be in the hospital. Jeffrey Gurian, comedian/comedy writer, radio personality, author, producer, and journalist I called 911. Two amazing ambulance workers—one of them was so kind, he took my hand and said: “Don’t worry, you’re going to be OK.” I remember them apologizing to me for the bumpy ride. Next thing I know I’m in the ER. How was your experience at NYU Langone? I must emphasize that every single person there was so kind. The cleaning people, transport, nurses, doctors…everybody—everybody that came into the room had something to do with me getting better. They kept bringing me ice packs, as many as I asked for, to bring down my fever—when it finally hit 98.6, it brought tears to my eyes. I couldn’t believe it. That happened to me several times while I was there. I teared up a lot because the concern from the staff was overwhelming. There were nurses that held my hand that told me I’d be OK, and just to hang in there. They were working very hard to get me better. Why did you make your gift to support COVID-19 care and research? Because I believe in gratitude. Be grateful no matter what’s going on—those people are going out of their way, they’re so brave. To show up every day knowing that you could catch this, that’s an amazing thing. My gratitude is endless. Some people haven’t been feeling seriously ill. Why should they consider a contribution? You don’t need to have a disease to contribute. The same way that people come out to applaud and cheer—out the windows, on the rooftops—many of those people are probably not sick, they’re just grateful that there are people out there who are trying to help. I think there’s a feeling of camaraderie. Serve your community and the world in general. Is laughter the best medicine? I’m one of the few doctors who has a longstanding career in comedy. There’s no question that laughter releases endorphins. When I had my heart attack, and they were working to place the stent, I was still awake and felt what they were doing. On the operating table, I was joking to the surgeon: “I feel you in my heart, and not in a romantic way.” Even in that situation, I was looking for the humor. It’s about being positive. I try to open my mind to all positive things because it can’t diminish you to do so. Jeffrey Gurian is a comedian/comedy writer, radio personality, author, producer, and journalist. He also trained as a cosmetic dentist and served previously for 12 years as a clinical professor within the Oral/Medicine/Oro-Facial Pain Department of New York University’s College of Dentistry.

On a cold day in January 2020, five-year-old Zemirah arrived in New York City from her home in St. Vincent Island in the Caribbean. Zemi had been very recently diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare cancer that occurs in the sympathetic nervous system, a part of the nervous system that helps control the body’s response to stress. The sympathetic nervous system includes organs and structures such as the intestines, smooth muscle, heart, and glands. A close family friend urged her parents to bring Zemi to New York for treatment at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone. Sadly, her parents couldn’t stay with her, and friends of the family stepped in to be with Zemi. The team at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital admitted Zemi to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and immediately began aggressive treatment of her cancer. She had brain surgery to remove her tumor and then started multiple rounds of high-dose chemotherapy. Her medical team, led by Elizabeth Raetz, MD, division director of hematology-oncology, could also see how scared Zemi was without her family, so they turned to the Child Life team, part of Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care, to support the young patient. Beth Kramsky, a certified child life therapist, answered the call and went to her bedside. “When Zemi was first hospitalized, she was withdrawn and anxious when meeting new staff and being in a new environment,” says Beth. “This is completely normal and one of the main reasons child life services are available—to counteract these feelings and help kids like Zemi feel more comfortable and supported.” Slowly Zemi engaged with the Sala team. She began to participate in activities most five-year-olds enjoy—like drawing, story time, and dancing to music. And her family away from home started to see the difference. “Zemi loves art so much! Art therapy definitely makes her feel more normal in the hospital, and engaging in any kind of art with her fingers—sand art, painting—are some of her favorite activities,” says Cherish Joseph, her cousin. Together the newly formed family did crafts and played games. “We also love to play bingo and hide and seek, and we have the best dance parties! We have a lot of fun together.” Zemi, a five-year-old cancer patient, enjoys doing arts and crafts with the Child Life team, part of Sala Institute. Zemi has had a long journey since she first came to Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. And she’s not done yet. She has undergone two stem cell transplants and is currently receiving immunotherapy. Despite these aggressive treatments, she still enjoys many of the activities and supportive care made possible by Sala. “Zemi is a tough little girl, but she always has a smile on her face,” says Dr. Raetz. Her family at home and in New York is grateful for the medical and supportive care Zemi has received at every step of the way. “She had an understandably challenging start, but she’s adjusted really well and has been responding to treatment like a champ,” reports Cherish. “Zemi is doing very well—we’re seeing a lot of good progress, thanks to the doctors, nurses, and Sala Institute team.” After creating and selling bracelets to help other kids, sisters tour Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital to see the impact of their latest venture. Sienna and Skye Alper are sisters from New York who inherited the family gene for crafting and selling jewelry. Hard workers and tough negotiators, Sienna and Skye make all their own business decisions–including the idea of donating their proceeds to Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital, which they recently toured to see firsthand the impact of their latest venture. And, oh yes—Sienna is 6 1/2, Skye, 4. Skye and Sienna donated the proceeds from their bracelet sales to Hassenfeld Children's Hospital. The story of their gift began when the sisters spent a morning making bracelet after bracelet. Their mother, Randi Udell-Alper, who is vice president at London Jewelers, suggested that they sell the bracelets at the East Hampton store since the girls had made so many. Sienna asked her mom if there was a children’s hospital they could donate the proceeds to, and Randi suggested Hassenfeld; she posted photos of the bracelets on social media, helping to drive customers to the store to buy them. Determined to maximize their gift, Sienna told her buyers “this is for charity—no change” if they paid more cash than was needed for a bracelet. Altogether, they raised about $2,000 from selling the jewelry. Learning about teamwork has been an important component of the sisters’ partnership, and they have found pleasure in philanthropy. Sienna’s next project, she says, will be to raise money to help dogs; her grandmother currently relocates stray dogs to shelters so that they can find new homes. One night late at work, Tanya Torosian received an unusual request. She’s a pediatric clinical pharmacist who works the overnight shift at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital, and that night she was given a medication order that exceeded the standard dose range for a child. Tanya contacted the provider who had requested the medicine and together they spoke about their shared concern with the physician specialist at 4:30 am. Tanya explained the patient’s other medications and together they agreed to maintain the current dosage. Tanya isn’t just a pharmacist. She’s also a safety coach, and the training she received for this special role equipped her with several important skills she used that night. “The tools I gained as a safety coach—to ask clarifying questions, stop and resolve, and don’t proceed in the face of uncertainty—helped me to resolve this issue,” Tanya says. Deanna Steffens, BS Pharm, MS Pharm, BCPPS (left), and Tanya Torosian, BS Pharm, MS Pharm, BCPPS (right), are not only sisters. They’re also pediatric clinical pharmacists and safety coaches at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. The Safety Coach Program supports hospital staff as they provide care to patients and families. The Safety Coach Program was created by the Children’s Hospitals’ Solutions for Patient Safety network, and in early 2020, it was tested and implemented by Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care, which leads patient safety and quality initiatives at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. Safety coaches are on the front lines working in hospital units to ensure medical and surgical care is safer for patients. They have been trained to observe colleagues’ work behaviors and provide feedback and positive reinforcement to their peers about safe patient care practices. According to Fiona Levy, MD, executive director of Sala Institute, any faculty or staff member with an interest in and commitment to patient safety can become a coach. “We ask our unit leaders to think broadly when nominating someone to the program, and as a result, we have doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, patient care technicians, and patient unit assistants,” says Dr. Levy. Through the training program for new coaches, the Sala team shares peer coaching techniques and provides advanced education to participants on safety behaviors and tools. “We develop our safety coaches as communicators, educators, role models, observers, storytellers, and ultimately change agents within their respective units” says Rebecca Kerns, senior project coordinator at Sala Institute. There are three core behavioral expectations explored throughout training that reinforce a shared responsibility to deliver safe patient care across the hospital. Together these three expectations demonstrate a deep commitment to patient and staff safety: Everyone makes a personal commitment to safety Everyone is accountable for clear and complete communication Everyone supports a questioning attitude Safety coaches reinforce these expectations and tools on their units. Not only do they coach their colleagues in real time, but they also model best practices. Deanna Steffens, who happens to be Tanya’s sister and also a pediatric clinical pharmacist and safety coach, says, “While we used safety practices before, now the Safety Coach Program has given additional training and strengthened our investigating, documenting, and sharing efforts.” Pradeep Mally, MD, division director of neonatology, has witnessed this deepened focus on safety firsthand in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). “Right now, it’s a culture change in the NICU,” says Dr. Mally. “During every shift there are at least two safety coaches who are identified in the NICU. Over the last couple of months, we have seen increased use of safety behaviors and tools, and every staff member feels supported in providing the safest possible care to newborns and the greatest comfort to families.” How to help make a child's vaccination experience positive. Pediatric patients are cruising in their new ride to the operating room. Visitors and staff in the Pediatric Surgery Center at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital–34th Street will need to watch out. Young patients can drive themselves from the pre-operative area to their procedures in a pint-size Mini Cooper. Before introducing this little buggy, the surgery team went to the Sala Family and Youth Advisory Councils for input on how to present the program in a sensitive and supportive manner to all patients and families. They listened to parents’ concerns, along with ideas from teens and families about how to make rides to the operating room as fun as possible, while developing alternatives for children who may not be able to drive for safety reasons. “Our intention is to improve the experience overall for children who are having a procedure,” says Jennifer Holohan, senior child life specialist in the pediatric surgery unit. “We know that surgery can be particularly stressful for children and parents alike, so we are happy to do anything we can to make it distracting and a bit more fun.” The new ride was brought to Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital thanks to The Paul Luisi Foundation, which raises funds for pediatric cancer research and for therapeutic tools for children’s hospitals. The foundation was created in honor of Paul Luisi, who was diagnosed with leukemia at an early age. Health Equity Institute makes sure that patient care, medical research, and medical professionals reflect underrepresented populations. Imagine a world that gives every single person an opportunity to live the healthiest life possible. This is the ultimate goal of health equity, which addresses barriers to good health, like limited access to nutritious food, a good education, or an affordable home. NYU Langone Health recently launched the Institute for Excellence in Health Equity to help advance health equity in communities and make sure that patient care, medical research, and medical professionals reflect underrepresented populations. The institute will mentor clinicians and medical trainees of color, contribute to national policy on health equity, educate medical students on this topic, and conduct research into health issues that affect minority populations more than white populations. Gbenga Ogedegbe, MD, MPH, new director of the Institute for Excellence in Health Equity, meets with Amanda Shallcross, MPH, ND The Institute for Excellence in Health Equity will be led by Gbenga Ogedegbe, MD, MPH. Dr. Ogedegbe is the Dr. Adolph and Margaret Berger Professor of Medicine and Population Health, director of the Center for Healthful Behavior Change, and director of the Division of Health & Behavior in the Department of Population Health. He is an internationally renowned physician-scientist and expert in health equity research with a focus on implementing evidence-based interventions targeted at cardiovascular risk reduction in minority populations. Four pillars to maximize impact The Institute for Excellence in Health Equity will be organized by four pillars—research, education, clinical care, and community—and will leverage existing academic talent in developing programs designed to accelerate the careers of the next generation of trainees and faculty. The research pillar will impact national policy on health equity by focusing on innovative, multi-centered, and cutting-edge peer-reviewed grants. The education pillar will advance undergraduate and graduate medical training by ensuring that students appreciate and integrate issues related to health equity. The institute will also serve to mentor trainees and faculty regarding professional milestones, thus encouraging and facilitating successful academic careers. The clinical care pillar will adapt NYU Langone Health delivery systems to achieve excellence in health equity outcomes, and the community pillar will advance health equity with a goal of fashioning scalable solutions to the health disparities in the community and across the nation. Sala specialists help patients and families process distressing feelings and learn new coping skills. Soccer is Jake’s favorite sport. The active eight-year-old loves playing on his local team alongside his friends. But when Jake started feeling sick for long periods of time, playing soccer—and many activities he enjoyed—grew harder. Tests done at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital revealed his diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. With this condition, the pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin, a hormone that helps blood sugar enter cells to be used as energy. The resulting high blood sugar can cause blurry vision, numb hands or feet, fatigue, weight loss, and other debilitating symptoms. The chronic, lifelong condition requires permanent adjustments for kids and families alike. Changes like strict diets, insulin injections, and regular finger pricks can cause discomfort and require parents’ round-the-clock help. “Type 1 diabetes is all-encompassing,” explains Becky Lois, PhD, a Sala Institute child and adolescent psychologist. “It creates a massive life shift for the whole family.” Jake quickly became concerned with what diabetes would mean for him. He wanted to know: Would he die early because of his diabetes? Could he still play soccer? “Naturally, many parents and providers want to reassure a child who’s received a new medical diagnosis that they’ll be OK,” Dr. Lois says. “Although Jake’s care team told him it was safe to play soccer, things weren’t sitting right with him. Deep down, he truly didn’t believe he was OK.” Jake’s anxiety played out on the field through panic attacks. That’s when his care team at the Robert I. Grossman, MD, and Elisabeth J. Cohen, MD, Pediatric Diabetes Center asked integrative behavioral health specialists from Sala Institute to help Jake and his family process his incredibly common yet distressing feelings about his diabetes diagnosis. Identifying Medical Trauma Medical trauma can result from a person’s difficult health experiences. It can stem from a single significant event, such as being rushed to the hospital for a medical emergency, or from many different experiences that accumulate over time, such as frequent hospital appointments or repeated blood draws. Vicarious medical trauma can also occur after witnessing or hearing about what happened to a loved one, friend, or peer. “Medical and vicarious trauma can come on immediately following a diagnosis, or surface only after a child or family member has had time to process their experiences,” explains Bethany Watson, PhD, a child and adolescent psychology fellow in Sala Institute. Signs of medical trauma are diverse and include panic attacks like those Jake had on the soccer field, acting out and testing limits in extreme ways, developmental regression, or certain statements, such as “I can’t sleep” or “I can’t stop thinking about what happened to me.” Compassionate Support Rooted in Research To help children and their families work through medical and vicarious trauma, Sala Institute’s team of psychologists, child life specialists, and social workers receive referrals from clinical teams or through a system of built-in behavioral health screenings across Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. “We’ve created universal touchpoints at the hospital and ambulatory care centers where we know it’s common to find individuals struggling with what we call little-T traumas that accumulate over time, and big-T traumas that can take the form of life-threatening or scary health events,” says Dr. Watson. From there, the road to recovery differs for every child and family member—but it always begins with education about the nature of trauma and helping the person to understand that every feeling is normal when it comes to processing stressful health experiences. “We’ve been helping Jake and his family understand that Jake’s fear is a very appropriate reaction to a diabetes diagnosis,” Dr. Lois explains. “When he expresses distress, his parents’ impulse is to save him from those feelings in the moment. In our sessions together, we’re giving space to listen to and validate Jake’s emotions.” The KiDS of NYU Integrative Behavioral Health team within Sala then helps the child and family make sense of their situation. They often teach new coping skills—for example, offering ways to navigate a panic attack—and help reframe their thinking. “Everything we do focuses on helping them take charge of their situation,” says Dr. Liaw, Director of Sala’s Child-Family Services and Resilience Programs. Sala Institute also provides diverse supports depending on what’s needed, such as nutritionists, creative arts therapists, physical therapists, and education for teachers in how best to support their students’ medical or behavioral needs. “A pillar of trauma-informed care is to teach kids to actively resist re-traumatization,” notes Dr. Watson. “We want to support kids to have affirming medical experiences, so in addition to helping them process past trauma, we proactively work to ensure their future medical experiences will be better.” Mentionable and Manageable Sala Institute’s specialists have helped Jake improve his outlook on life. He and his family are equipped with new coping skills, a deeper understanding of their feelings, and the courage to hold space for Jake’s difficult emotions. His family asked diabetes educators to meet with Jake’s soccer coach and teammates to share how they can help their son. “I always like to say, ‘If it’s mentionable, it’s manageable,’” shares Dr. Watson. “We can’t take the pain or the trauma away; we cannot erase what happened. But we can help them to carry their experiences forward with new skills, agency, and a sense of validation.” We also seek out children who are internalizing their trauma and are quiet about it—not acting out in ways that command attention and prompt intervention, but who are still suffering.

Sara Damour – Member, Sala Youth Advisory Council It’s amazing how much a simple thing like giving kids a toy to entertain them while they’re in the hospital can do for their health. It’s all about helping our patients just be kids again. Frances Clemente Child Life Specialist “I received remarkable, expert cardiac care at NYU Langone that dramatically transformed my quality of life. All delivered… Vanessa J I. Patient Support the Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care Early graduate of NYU Grossman School of Medicine answers a call to serve. In a valley of the Andes Mountains lies Cusco, Peru, where Wi-Fi is spotty and U.S. news limited. As Gabriela Ulloa, MD, conducted qualitative breast cancer research at a clinic there in early 2020, she would get occasional COVID-19 news in the form of phone calls from her mother, who was stateside. “Her updates went from, ‘I don’t think it’s going to end up coming to the U.S.’ to ‘It sounds widely infectious and is hitting China hard,’” Dr. Ulloa recalls. “Eventually, Mom’s calls transformed into panicked updates.” Dr. Gabriela Ulloa was one of 52 students at NYU Grossman School of Medicine who volunteered to put their plans on hold to serve as interns alongside their colleagues at NYU Langone Health. Dr. Ulloa and her husband, Jorge, who had joined her in Peru to explore the region and then visit his family in Bolivia, made it back to New York City just before the borders closed. Soon after, Dr. Ulloa vividly remembers receiving an email from the dean of her school, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, to ask if any students would consider cutting short their final year of med school to work on the front lines. “I was sitting on the couch crying for 40 minutes after I read the email,” Dr. Ulloa explains. “I felt that if you receive an email at 7 pm on a Sunday from your dean offering early graduation, the hospital really needs [you]. I felt the urgency of how much the med school was willing to go through for us because they needed help.” After talking it over with her husband, Dr. Ulloa signed on. “It was a no-brainer for us,” she says. “I saw my friends in their intern year struggling, not having enough [personnel to] allow them normal working hours and conditions. I really commend them. We always have to recognize that they were working very hard before we even got there, which prompted us to be able to volunteer to join them—and hopefully help them.” Dr. Ulloa was assigned to NYU Langone’s Tisch Hospital, where her first patient’s COVID-19 symptoms had improved considerably and she was being discharged. “She reminded me of my abuela , my great-grandmother,” she recalls. “The patient had a lot of co-morbidities—chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease. In my very short career as a doctor, I had never discharged somebody who was so scared to go home. We spoke to each other in Spanish. She had a lot of questions about COVID-19 side effects. Would she get sick again? And it was hard to answer any of those questions at that time because so little was known. I just remember feeling lost and very scared for her as well.” Dr. Ulloa’s fluency in Spanish became invaluable, as the Tisch population grew heavily Hispanic during the pandemic surge, which was in contrast to Dr. Ulloa’s past experiences on the internal medicine floors there. “This felt like a completely different population than I was used to at Tisch,” Dr. Ulloa says. “Now, I was using my Spanish every single day. On a personal note, it was tough to see people who looked like my family, who had similar occupations to my family, be really sick and really scared at the same time. But I was happy to be able to speak with them, and hopefully calm their fears a little bit.” In addition to the parallels she felt with her patients, Dr. Ulloa found that her pediatric training served COVID-19 patients and families well. “In pediatrics, you’re constantly dealing with the patient’s family, which is why I love the field,” she says. “You’re used to explaining things in lay terms, and sometimes you need to articulate honestly that you don’t know what a certain symptom means in a way that is not upsetting to the family. I was able to apply these skills to COVID-19 care and help communicate with family members of geriatric patients especially—a population [for whom] it’s normally taken for granted that loved ones will be by the bedside.” The experience has also shed new light on a possible new area for Dr. Ulloa to pursue: pediatric intensive care. She says that working on the COVID-19 floors presented stressors similar to those that intensive care units (ICUs) often experience—and that she thrived in this challenging environment. “Even though it was really, really tough, I felt satisfied in that I was coping,” Dr. Ulloa says. “I could not only tolerate but do well in an ICU setting, where patients and families are typically quite upset. I also felt impassioned speaking to people in Spanish who didn’t understand their diagnoses or what we were doing with their care. Being able to connect like that with the Hispanic population through a difficult medical experience is rare, especially in an ICU setting.” Grateful for the first-rate education he received at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Dr. Perelman has supported the school’s scholarship fund for 26 years. Seth Perelman, MD, credits NYU Grossman School of Medicine—where he earned his medical degree 26 years ago—for his successful career as an anesthesiologist. Dr. Perelman with his daughter, Allison, at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine White Coat Ceremony “The school really gave me the foundation and skills I needed to be a continual learner of medicine,” says Dr. Perelman. “It was a wonderful education. It was very challenging, but the curriculum was designed in a collegial way, which I think is a perfect way to learn.” Grateful for his time there, Dr. Perelman has contributed to the school’s scholarship fund every year since graduating in 1989, enabling other students to have the same type of experience he did. “I’ve heard stories about some of the current medical students who would not have been able to pursue a medical education, let alone one at NYU, without having tuition assistance. I know the dollars are being used wisely,” he says. He adds, “I’m sure physicians are not the school’s major financial donors. But I think that giving sends a message to the community, about how important institutions like NYU Langone and NYU Grossman School of Medicine are—to New York City and to the future of medicine in the U.S.” Dr. Perelman’s passion for his alma mater appears to be contagious. Following in his footsteps, his daughter, Allison, just began her first year at the school. What advice does Dr. Perelman have for Allison? “I told her to expect the most challenging, albeit enjoyable, educational experience. And that she’ll make the best friends that she’ll ever have in her academic career.” “It’s nice to see that some of the teachers I had are still there,” says Dr. Perelman, “and will be educating my daughter on aspects of medicine that were only touched on 26 years ago. Their longevity shows their love for teaching at NYU—and, I imagine, their good health!” Comprehensive support services from Sala Institute help a family through a five-month NICU stay. Lwam Rafel gave birth to her daughter, Sloane, in November 2019 at NYU Langone. Sloane was born extremely premature at just 25 weeks gestation following a complicated and unexpectedly high-risk pregnancy that required several hospital stays, multiple blood transfusions, and finally, a sudden, emergent delivery. Sloane was born at 25 weeks gestation and spent five months in the NICU at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. Sloane and her family received comprehensive supportive services from Sala Institute. Baby Sloane spent five months in the NICU at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone, mainly due to her under-developed lungs. She was intubated for three months to help her breath. Lwam and her husband, Jesse, brought Sloane home in April 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Welcoming the newest member of the family should be a joyous time, but when a serious medical crisis accompanies the birth, the notion of what is “supposed to” transpire is anything but normal. Lwam credits the compassionate NICU team and Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care with helping her family throughout this time. The Sala multidisciplinary team included social workers, child life specialists, and an early childhood psychologist. Their expertise in conjunction with the medical team comprised a holistic approach to support the Rafel family. “Throughout our NICU stay, from social workers to Child Life to the psychologists, we have picked up tools and skills that we also give to our children and use beyond the hospital walls around dealing with challenges including resilience, kindness, and grace,” Lwam explains. Social workers from Sala facilitate communication between families and the medical team, ensuring mutual understanding of medical terminology and the family’s unique needs. Erin Collins, director of Pediatric Social Work, says, “Sala’s impact ensures we provide needed resources and support for families. Social workers meet the family where they are that day in that moment so we can provide a range of support based on their specific needs.” They also connect families to resources that support their transition to home or the next level of care within the medical system, all with the shared goal of alleviating stressors so they can focus on the care for their child. During Sloane’s stay in the NICU, Erin Villani, a pediatric social worker, noted that the Rafels were true partners, always asking questions and learning as much as they could about Sloane’s medical conditions. Lwam knew that skin-to-skin contact, or Kangaroo Care, has proven successful in patient outcomes, including stabilizing the baby’s heart rate and regulating breathing patterns. “Lwam advocated for being able to hold her daughter,” says Villani. “We came together as a team to assess how we could make this happen.” The team taught the Rafels how to work around the equipment so they could physically bond with Sloane. “Lwam was always respectful of our team and a wonderful partner in care. This new approach has enabled other parents to use Kangaroo Care with their infants in the NICU sooner than they might have in the past,” says Villani. Marking Milestones in Little Sister’s Progress For Lwam and Jesse, explaining to big brother Asher, then two years old, that his little sister wasn’t coming home immediately after she was born was daunting. Stacey Schneider, a child life specialist, recommended using a sticker chart so Asher could mark milestones in Sloane’s progress. “Child Life helped me find and create joy and connection when I felt like I was at a constant loss for it,” says Lwam. They also did hand printing projects to compare Asher’s size to his sister’s and provided a picture frame that he decorated so he could share her photo at school and keep it near his bed. “This gives the sibling some ‘proof’ that the baby is part of their family and ‘belongs’ to them as well,” says Schneider. Giving Back to Other Patients and Families As a result of her family’s experiences, Lwam joined the Sala Family Advisory Council. The council meets monthly and is comprised of 35 family members of patients at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. Alongside the Sala Youth Advisory Council, the group provides input on new programming and initiatives for current and future children and families at the hospital. Liza Cooper, LMSW, is manager of Family and Youth Partnerships and Resources at Sala Institute and works directly with the council. “Lwam is a changemaker. There are some people who can tell a story about a challenging time in their life that makes you think; when Lwam tells her story, it changes the way you see things,” says Cooper. The Kangaroo Care initiative and the support from Social Work, Child Life and Early Childhood Psychology that families receive are all possible through Sala Institute, which is supported by generous donors. As a parent of a child in the NICU and a Sala Family Advisory Council member, Lwam is grateful to help other families gain confidence and empowerment in their roles as parents and healthcare advocates. She remarks, “Through what we went through, I know I’ve become a better parent. I can speak up for my kids, saying what will work for our family and what won’t, and I can partner better with the medical team to make sure we are working together each and every time to get our kids the best possible care.” Because of Sala, essential services and support are offered in a consistent, well-coordinated manner, in all areas where children receive care. I’ve been a child life specialist for about 13 years now. Child life specialists help children and families cope with the hospital setting, and we do that in various ways, from age-appropriate preparation for surgery or procedures to distraction during procedures to help children refocus their attention. Frances Clemente, MS, CCLS, Child Life Specialist Program Coordinator, Sala Institute We try to normalize their experience while they’re in the hospital or after they have a procedure, to get back to a baseline and help them to just be kids. Play is really important to children—it’s their form of communication. It’s how they express themselves. We just did a teddy bear clinic where the kids got to play doctor. When they take their teddy bears through the procedures of height and weight or getting a checkup, the kids feel more powerful and in control. I conduct trainings throughout Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital with physicians, nurses, medical assistants, and others, to support their skills in communicating and working effectively with children of all ages. I also work with parents, so that they can better help their children cope with procedures and fears they may have. I run a program called Connect the Dots. We provide education and resources to patients, families, and healthcare providers, to facilitate a consistent, developmentally appropriate experience, wherever care is given. I think what’s so beneficial to the design of our programs and to the delivery of care to our patients and families is the involvement of Sala Institute’s Family Advisory Council, Youth Advisory Council, and family advisers. I think getting their opinions on all the projects that we’re working on, and getting their input from the very beginning, is really essential. Two groups raise money to give gift cards to young patients in Long Island. This past holiday season, enthusiastic teens from Teen Project and Charlie’s Champions Foundation joined together to raise $23,000 for teenage patients receiving care at NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island and NYU Langone Cancer Center for Kids–Mineola. Teen Project, which first began in 2014, was founded by teens Steven and Matthew Spirakis, who wanted to empower local teens to give back. The Spirakis brothers have long volunteered and supported the hospital’s annual Swim-a-thon, a Child Life Program fundraiser founded by their pediatrician, Dr. Ron Marino. We learned the hospital often receives toy donations for young patients, but seldom receives appropriate gifts for teen patients. We decided to help by collecting gift cards teens our age preferred to receive and donating them to the hospital. —Spirakis Delaney Zander, Luke Schmitt, T. J. Schmitt, Matthew Spirakis, and Steven Spirakis present a $23,000 check to NYU Langone Health’s Heather Dall’Aste and Nicole Almeida from the online fundraiser by Teen Project and Charlie’s Champions Foundation. The annual fundraiser has raised $80,000 in donations since its inception seven years ago. The success of the campaign is largely due to the early expansion of the Holiday Project. In 2017, the Spirakis brothers partnered with T.J. and Luke Schmitt of Garden City–Charlie’s Champions Foundation, a prominent supporter of the Cancer Center for Kids (CCFK), which provides care to pediatric patients battling cancer and complex blood disorders. The foundation was established by the Schmitt family in honor of Charlie Schmitt, a cancer survivor who was treated at CCFK. “We have been raising money and awareness for Charlie’s Champions Foundation since we were both in middle school and because of what we experienced firsthand with one of our cousins being treated at CCFK. The gift cards were a great idea to show the teenagers that we understood them as peers. Gift cards allow them to shop online just like we enjoy doing,” says T. J. Schmitt. successful fundraiser took place on NYU Langone’s Giving website, which is available to all people or groups looking for a virtual way to support any area of the hospital. In the time of COVID-19, the distance most people have in mind is six feet. But long-distance runner Alex Eisen of Mineola, New York, had his eyes set on a much longer length: 30 miles. To ring in his 30th birthday, Alex knew he wanted to support the frontline clinicians, nurses, and staff of NYU Langone Health and NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island.  As a thank you for tireless efforts of the healthcare workers, he would set up an online campaign around the most grueling distance he had ever attempted—30 miles around Mineola and neighboring Port Washington, where he teaches fourth grade. He would make the journey on his birthday. When the pandemic hit, he immediately knew he wanted to help, and NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island was top of mind. NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island had helped Alex in the past—living with asthma, he needed emergency services at points throughout his life. “It’s near and dear to my heart.” Early on April 21, he set out even as the forecast called for rain (and, oh, it rained; though he narrowly beat the afternoon tornado warnings for Nassau County.). And, with a little help from his in-house camera crew—brother behind the camera, mother behind the wheel—he livestreamed the entire event on Facebook, raising thousands of dollars over the course of the run to help battle the coronavirus. “I’ve been trying to get my friends to join me [on a race]. One of them said he’d do the last .2 if I could handle the first 26” (typical marathons are 26.2 miles). But on the 30-mile run, Alex wasn’t alone; over 150 donors cheered him on with contributions of all sizes. As of this writing, his campaign has raised over $12,000. Additionally, his story was picked up by local news—even further extending his reach. Watch coverage from ABC7 here Post-run, life didn’t take long to get back to (quarantine) normal. Sore and hobbling at 8 am the following day, he returned to his students online: “I basically told them, ‘If I’m going to be there, I expect you to, too.’” And that’s how you teach dedication.

Give to NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island’s 2022 Golf Classic Sala leads efforts to enhance support for children with chronic illnesses. A child’s experience with diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or other chronic condition often affects the entire family. Each person can develop stress, depression, or anxiety, and have difficulty coping with the disease’s challenges. And yet, to many parents, pediatricians haven’t adequately addressed these widespread mental health needs. Parent advocates from across the United States asked the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) to prioritize the emotional and behavioral health of chronically ill children and their families. The ABP agreed. It launched the Roadmap Project to develop behavioral health assessment resources and techniques for all American pediatricians who care for kids with chronic illness. Collaborate to Innovate In 2019, the ABP created a collaborative of nine top children’s hospitals to work on the Roadmap Project, including Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital with leadership from Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care, which is renowned for helping chronically ill children and their families cope with their emotions and build resilience. “The Roadmap Project is opening up a national conversation about how we can systematically address these gaps in care delivery,” explains Becky Lois, PhD, co-director of KiDS of NYU Integrated Behavioral Health program, part of Sala Institute. “There were already a lot of resources about checking in on the emotional health and well-being of specific patient populations, such as those with cystic fibrosis. The Roadmap initiative expands that work and says, ‘All of us in pediatrics need to take this on and address emotional health for every patient at every visit.’” Dr. Mary Pat Gallagher To help create the Roadmap, each of the nine hospital teams—made up of practitioners and family partners—tested the Roadmap’s proposed behavioral health approaches within a specific area of their institution. The Robert I. Grossman, MD, and Elisabeth J. Cohen, MD, Pediatric Diabetes Center, led by Mary Pat Gallagher, MD, was selected as Hassenfeld’s pilot site. “The Roadmap Project really dovetails with what we already do at the center with support from Sala, which is incorporating emotional and behavioral health in our daily work with children and families, in ways that families help design,’’ Dr. Gallagher explains. “The idea was that each hospital could learn from what the others did. Our goal was to test the effectiveness of techniques that could apply broadly across chronic illnesses—like depression screening or proactive education about the importance of emotional health—and then train all staff, from dietitians to nurses, in these techniques.” Small Changes Lead to Big Improvements For its part in the Roadmap Project, the Pediatric Diabetes Center created a new screening process for depression and anxiety. To build it out effectively, Dr. Gallagher says her team focused on “small tests of change” for the screening, meaning they would plan, implement, study, and then re-implement pieces of the process in real time. This allowed for continual improvement—a hallmark of the Roadmap Project. The first step in the new screening process asks a patient or family member four short questions. A high score suggests the likelihood of emotional distress and prompts a larger screening. The Pediatric Diabetes Center began its test by screening one family and asking for their feedback. As the screening process evolved, Dr. Gallagher decided that even if someone scored zero (indicating no anxiety or depression), she would still talk to them about emotional and behavioral health, thank them for anything they shared, and provide a handout with more resources. “We’re still iterating,” Dr. Gallagher notes of the center’s new, customizable screening process for anxiety and depression, “but the system is already well enough developed that we are able to offer it to all of our patients in the center. It’s already making a difference.” The Roadmap Launches Nationally Efforts like these across all nine participating children’s hospitals to test small changes in assessing children’s behavioral health yielded valuable results. The ABP and hospital collaborators used their findings to produce a suite of practical online educational resources that are now being adopted nationwide by pediatricians and other practitioners who work with chronically ill children and their families. The Roadmap website also offers resources to support families who identify as Black. “Roadmap Project participation by parents identifying as minorities helped inform our understanding of their unique experiences,” Dr. Lois notes. “They reinforced that when we think about how patients and their families come to us, and what their experiences have been with medical teams and hospital settings, we have a lot to do to create safe spaces for patients and families, in a culturally sensitive way.” Dr. Lois believes the Roadmap’s magic lies in its customizable approach to behavioral and emotional health assessments. She says, “We now have some of the tools we need as health care professionals to normalize mental health check-ins with our patients and families, in all their forms of diversity.” A second-year medical student in virtual reality (VR) goggles immerses himself in wraparound high-resolution graphics that make him feel as though he is standing inside a larger-than-life healthy lung. His classmates follow what he’s doing on a computer monitor. With the click of a controller, he gives the lung chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A collective gasp rises in the room, as students can see in vivid, almost living, detail the disease’s effects on the lung. “Swiss cheese,” the student murmurs. “Don’t smoke,” another says. “Virtual reality is used by doctors to plan surgeries at NYU Langone Health,” says Marc Triola ’98, Res. ’02, associate dean for educational informatics and founding director of the Institute for Innovations in Medical Education (IIME). “It’s used by researchers to visualize data and enables us to look inside the human body in ways that used to be physically impossible. We introduce our students to it early in their education because it will be such a big part of their world view.” Innovations in Technology and Information Systems Have Revolutionized Healthcare Delivery and Biomedical Research But U.S. medical schools, says Dr. Triola, have typically lagged behind in using these innovations to augment the essential—and unwavering—patient learning. NYU Grossman School of Medicine is leading the way forward through the work of the IIME, which applies technology and the science of education and informatics to transform teaching, learning, evaluation, and assessment. With 28 full-time staff and more than 30 affiliate faculty, the IIME is one of the largest medical education innovation groups in the country and represents a multidisciplinary team of faculty educators, education scientists, informaticians (data experts), and multimedia developers. In programs and initiatives across undergraduate and graduate medical education, and in close conjunction with the health system, the IIME aims to close the gap between how doctors practice medicine and how medical students and trainees learn in the classroom and clinical settings. The institute curates and develops education technology for the school, including using augmented and virtual reality to immerse students in highly experiential learning, apps such as in-the-moment evaluation tools and clinical resources for students and educators, and multimedia e-learning modules that supplement and enrich in-class learning. Dr. Marc M. Triola We’re leveraging all this data that we collect about our learners, about the curriculum, and about the healthcare system to inform our educational programs. It’s moved us away from education driven by anecdotes to education driven by an epidemiologic approach. “It’s never technology for technology’s sake,” says Crystal Mainiero, MPA, IIME’s executive director. “Technology in medical education is meant to support active, integrated, personalized learning. It’s always an enabler to [help students] do some really amazing things.” The institute, which grew out of the Division of Educational Informatics, also avidly collects and leverages a wide range of data and evidence to inform and improve the education experience, making use of the rich data already available across the health system. “We are a science-driven medical center. Gaining insight from data is a theme that has transformed our clinical mission and our research mission. Now we’re working to make sure it’s transforming our education mission,” says Dr. Triola, emphasizing that data does not replace human decision making but rather positions decision making to be more successful because it is more informed. New Insights Pinpoint New Opportunities Using data from a wide set of sources—including the
