Browne, MD, Kevin A. Sonn, MD, Ran Schwarzkopf, MD, MSc 2022 AAHKS Annual Meeting | Final Program62Introduction: Reimbursements for revision Total Hip Arthroplasty (revTHA) procedures have substantially declined; however, the population level effects of these trends on patient access are not well understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the trends in (1) the number of high volume primary and revision THA surgeons between 2013 to 2019 and (2) county level geographic access to these surgeons over the same period. Methods: The Medicare Fee for Service Provider Utilization and Payment Public Use Files (POSPUF) were used to extract data for primary and revision THA procedures using the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes (HCPCS) 27130 for primary and 27132, 27134, 27137, or 27138 for revision cases. Geospatial analyses were performed by aggregating surgeon practice locations at the level of individual counties, Hospital Service Areas (HSA) and Hospital Referral Regions (HRR). Results: The number of surgeons performing at least 10 primary THA within the Medicare population increased by 17. over the study period (from 3,838 in 2013 to 4,515 in 2019). Conversely, the number of surgeons submitting at least 10 revTHA Medicare claims decreased by approximately 36. over the same timeframe (from 178 in 2013 to 129 in 2019). The number of counties with at least one high volume primary THA surgeon increased by 6. from 2013 to 2019. Meanwhile, the number of counties with at least one high volume revTHA surgeon decreased by 30. over the study period. Conclusion: Declining geographic access to high volume revTHA surgeons may represent a consequence of shifting economic incentives and declining reimbursements for the care of complicated revTHA patients. Key stakeholders in the surgeon, hospital and payer community must consider the impact of future fee schedule changes on economic disincentives surrounding the care of challenging complications.NotesPaper #39Declining Geographic Access to High Volume Revision Hip Arthroplasty Surgeons (2013 2019) Tarun K. Jella, MPH, Thomas B. Cwalina, MBA, Alexander L. Roth, MD, Nathan W. Mesko, MD, Atul F. Kamath, MD 63www.AAHKS.org/MeetingIntroduction: Revision hip arthroplasty (RHA) is usually accompanied by metaphyseal bone loss and the need for a diaphyseal engaging tapered splined titanium stem (TSTS). The impact of an extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO) on TSTS subsidence is unknown. Thus, we sought to investigate whether an ETO increased mean subsidence and the associated radiographic factors.Methods: This single center retrospective cohort study collected all TSTS implanted at time of femoral revision between 9/1/2016 and 11/23/2020. Patients with <3 months of follow up or incomplete radiographic follow up were excluded. All radiographic measurements were performed by a single observer. The stem contact length was measured above and below the transverse segment of the ETO. Intra class correlation coefficient was used to determine intra rater reliability. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables and a Pearson's correlation was used to determine the association between contact length and subsidence.Results: Two hundred ninety eight (299 hips) patients were identified with a mean age of 67±11.8 years, mean BMI of 28±7.2 kg/m2, and mean follow up of 19.3±11.8 months. There were 66 ETOs (22.) performed. Intra rater reliability was 0.89 and 0.94 for subsidence and contact length respectively. Overall mean subsidence at latest follow up was 3.0±0.2 mm. The mean subsidence for Non ETO patients was 2.5±0.2mm versus 5.1±0.7mm with an ETO (p< 0.001). The mean contact length for Non ETO patients was 64±1.9mm versus 61±4.2mm in ETO patients (p=0.12). Specifically, the contact length above the ETO was 23±3.2mm versus 38±3.8mm below (intact diaphysis). We found a significant inverse relationship between TSTS contact length and subsidence in non ETO patients ( 0.33, p< 0.001). Contact length below the ETO was also an inversely related to subsidence ( 0.26, p=0.037). However, the overall contact length within the ETO did not correlate with stem subsidence ( 0.12, p=0.359). Conclusion: An ETO performed during RHA was associated with significantly higher subsidence. Contact length was inversely related (lower contact length/more stem subsidence) with stem subsidence below the ETO and in Non ETO patients. Surgeons should focus on contact length below ETO level when assessing contact length during revision THA.NotesPaper #40Does an Extended Trochanteric Osteotomy Increase the Risk of Tapered Splined Stem Subsidence?

The purpose of this study is to report on outcomes of DM implants used in revision THA from the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR). Methods: Patients ≥65 years old who underwent a revision THA from 2012 2018 were screened for inclusions. Patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) DM articulation, (2) ≤32 mm solid bearing and (3) ≥36 mm solid bearing cohorts. The dataset was merged with Medicare claims data available through Jun 2020 to supplement outcome cases not captured in the AJRR. Patient and hospital characteristics were analyzed using multivariate statistical modeling to minimize potential confounding and identify independent associations with re revision. All cause re revision for any reason and re revision for instability were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Results: Overall, 20,728 revision THAs were identified, of which 3,043 (14.) received a DM articulation, 6,565 (31.) a ≤32 mm femoral head, and 11,120 (53.) a ≥36 mm femoral head. At eight year follow up, the cumulative all cause re revision rate for the ≤32 mm group (21., CI 20.2 23.) was significantly higher than the DM (16., CI 15.0 18.) and ≥36mm (15., CI 14.2 16.) groups (p< 0.0001). At eight years, the ≥36 mm group showed the lowest rate of re revision for instability (3., CI 2.9 3.) while the DM (5., CI 4.5 6.) and ≤32 mm groups (8., CI 7.7 9.) had higher rates (p< 0.0001). Conclusion: DM bearings are associated with lower rates of revision for instability compared to patients with ≤32 mm heads, but marginally higher rates of revision for patients with ≥36 mm heads. These results may be limited by unidentified confounding factors as patients at higher risk of dislocation may have preferentially received a DM articulation.NotesPaper #41Dual Mobility Articulation in Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty: An AJRR Analysis Jesse E. Otero, MD, PhD, Nathanael D. Heckmann, MD, Kyle Mullen, MPH, Jay R. Lieberman, MD, Bryan D. Springer, MD www.AAHKS.org/Meeting65Introduction: Dual mobility (DM) implants reduce the risk of dislocation in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Dislocated DM can present as a true dislocation of the entire modular head from the acetabulum, or as an intraprosthetic dislocation (IPD), where the inner head dissociates from the outer polyethylene bearing. This study reports the incidence of DM dislocations and IPD and evaluates the treatment and long term outcomes of dislocated DM THA. Methods: 695 primary and 758 revision DM THA were implanted at our institution from 2010 2021. 54 DM THA in 48 patients sustained at least one dislocation event. Mean time to dislocation was 41 weeks, mean age was 64 years, were female and mean follow up was 2.5 years. Patient outcomes were evaluated by retrospective chart review. Results: 44 hips presented with true dislocations ( incidence) and 10 presented with IPD (0. incidence). 9 of 10 IPD were missed at presentation and four additional iatrogenic IPD occurred during reduction attempts, increasing IPD incidence to . Reduction attempts in the emergency department failed in of DM, closed reduction attempts in the operating room failed in and second attempts at closed reduction failed in . Closed reduction was more successful under anesthesia with paralysis (p=0.03). Ultimately required open reduction or revision to treat the dislocation, re dislocated and five hips underwent subsequent revision at a mean 1.8 years after dislocation. Conclusion: The incidence of DM dislocation and IPD remains low; however, of IPD were missed, highlighting the importance of DM identification at presentation. Closed reductions were more successful with paralysis; however, the majority of dislocated DM required open management. Given the high conversion rate to open management and risk of iatrogenic IPD, we recommend attempting closed reduction in the operating room, where one may convert to open management as needed.NotesPaper #42Dislocated Dual Mobility THA: Most Need Open Reduction and Intraprosthetic Dissociation Often Missed Katherine E.

Previous malpractice studies limit their review to primary total joint arthroplasties (TJAs), do not compare hip and knee surgery to other subspecialties and do not analyze contemporary litigation. This study aimed to determine 1) damages and negligence claimed; 2) proportion of different case outcomes; 3) factors associated with defense verdicts; and 4) differences in litigation patterns between orthopaedic subspecialties. Methods: VerdictSearch, a nationwide database, was queried for all orthopaedic medical malpractice claims from 2015 2020. Variables included: case outcome, indemnity payment, damages, negligence claimed, treatment, patient characteristics. A binary logistic regression determined if any collected variable increased the likelihood of defense verdict. Results: A total of 164 claims from 17 states were reviewed. Hip and knee surgery was the most frequent subspecialty (n=58, 38.; Knee: n=35, 21.; Hip: n=23, 14.). Other orthopaedic subspecialties represented were Spine (n=36; 22.), Trauma (n=28;17.), Hand & Wrist (n=16; 9.), Foot & Ankle (n=7; 4.), Sports (n=7; 4.), Pediatric (n=6; 3.), and Shoulder (n=6; 3.). Within hip and knee surgery, the most frequent treatments were primary TJAs (n=34; 56.8) and revision TJAs (n=7; 12.). Defense verdicts occurred in 44 cases (75.), while 12 (20.) resulted in plaintiff verdicts (Mean Award: $4,241,965) and 2 (3.) resulted in settlements (Mean Amount: $1,550,000). The most common damages were nerve injuries (n=13; 22.) and infections (n=9; 15.). The most common negligence were procedural errors (n=33; 56.) and diagnostic errors (n=21; 36.). The only variable independently associated with decreased likelihood of defense outcome was non reversible damages (e.g., paralysis, amputation, death; p< 0.001). Conclusion: Hip and knee surgery was the highest represented subspecialty in orthopaedic malpractice litigation. Surgeons are more frequently found negligent when non reversible damages occurred. Hip and knee surgeons should be cognizant of litigation patterns while ensuring patient centered high quality care.NotesPaper #43Hip & Knee Surgery Is the Most Litigated in Contemporary Orthopaedic Malpractice ClaimsNicholas Sauder, BS, Ahmed K.

Piuzzi, MD 2022 AAHKS Annual Meeting | Final Program68Introduction: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a reliable and safe procedure that is associated with predictably good outcomes. As perioperative management of patients undergoing TKA has advanced, more medically frail patients have become candidates. One such cohort is patients requiring chronic anti coagulation (CA) for underlying medical comorbidities. We aimed to explore if these patients can expect similar complication rates following TKA as patients not requiring CA. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study using The Truven Marketscan® databases. Patients undergoing primary TKA were identified and divided into cohorts based on preoperative medication status (i.e., having an anti coagulation prescription filled six prior to and six months following surgery). Patients undergoing revision surgery, those <18 years old, and those without 6 month preoperative and 2 year postoperative enrollment were excluded. Patient demographics and comorbidities were collected and controlled for in the analysis of 90 day and two year outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare outcomes between cohorts. Results: 53,168 patients were included with 12,367 on preoperative CA (18.). At 90 days, CA patients had increased odds of wound complications (OR 1.64, CI 1.42 1.91, p< 0.001), hematoma formation (OR 2.35, CI 1.82 3.04, p< 0.001), and revision surgery (OR 1.26, CI 1.06 1.50, p=0.01). At two years, CA patients had increased odds of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) (OR 1.63, CI 1.44 1.86, p< 0.001) as well as non infectious revision surgery (OR 2.03, CI 1.50 2.76, p< 0.001). Conclusion: Preoperative CA is associated with significantly higher odds of 90 day and 2 year complications after primary TKA. In particular, the increased odds of PJI and aseptic revision should be noted given their significant associated morbidity. Patients receiving CA should be counseled preoperatively regarding these risks.NotesPaper #44Chronic Anticoagulation: Increased Risk for Complication Following Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty Rahul K. Goel, MD, Jacob M. Wilson, MD, Philip O. Oladeji, MD, Alexander M. Dawes, BS, Keerat Singh, MD, George N. Guild, MD 69www.AAHKS.org/MeetingIntroduction: The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a 12 item questionnaire used to track knee arthroplasty outcomes. Validation of such patient reported outcome measures is typically anchored to a single question based on patient ‘satisfaction’; however risk of subsequent revision surgery is also recognized as an important outcome measure. The OKS is a strong predictor of subsequent revision risk within two years; however, it is not known which item(s) are the strongest predictors. Our aim was therefore to identify which questions were most important in the prediction of subsequent knee arthroplasty revision risk. Methods: All primary TKAs (n=27,708) and UKAs (n=8,415) captured by the New Zealand Joint Registry between 1999 and 2019 with at least one OKS response at six months, five years and ten years post surgery were included. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to assess prediction models at six months, five years, and ten years. Results: Q1 ‘overall pain’ was the strongest predictor of revision within two years (TKA: 6 months, odds ratio (OR) 0.70; 5 years, OR 0.56; 10 years, OR 0.70; UKA: 6 months, OR 0.76; 5 years, OR 0.35; 10 years, OR 0.54; all p< 0.05). A reduced model with just three questions (Q1, Q6 ‘limping when walking’,Q10 ’knee giving way’ showed comparable diagnostic ability with the full OKS (area under the curve (AUC): TKA: 6 months, 0.77 vs. 0.76; 5 years, 0.78 vs. 0.75; 10 years, 0.76 vs. 0.73; UKA: 6 months, 0.80 vs. 0.78; 5 years: 0.81 vs. 0.77; 10 years, 0.80 vs. 0.77; all NS). Conclusion: The three questions on overall knee pain, limping when walking and knee ‘giving way’ were the strongest predictors of subsequent revision within two years. Attention to the responses for these three key questions during follow up may allow for prompt identification of patients most at risk of revision.NotesPaper #45The Three Strongest Oxford Knee Score Questions that Predict Subsequent Knee Arthroplasty Revision Mei Lin Tay, MS, Andrew P.

The purposes were: 1) to determine the rates of bone healing, complications and revisions secondary to TTO; 2) to assess the functional outcomes of RTKA with TTO; 3) to identify the risk factors of failure. Methods: Between 2010 to 2020, 810 RTKA were included in a prospective database. Inclusion criteria were RTKA with TTO, without extensor mechanism allograft, with at least two years of follow up. 135 RTKA were included, with a mean age of 65±9 years old, a mean BMI of 29.8kg/m²±5.7. Most frequent indications for revision were: infections, aseptic loosening, stiffness. Bone healing was confirmed on radiographs or CT scan. Complications and revisions were evaluated at the last follow up. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and range of motion. Results: The mean follow up was 51±26 months [24 121]. Bone healing was confirmed for of patients after a delay of 3.4±2.7months. Complication rate was (n=20): 9 tibial tubercle fracture (6.), 7 non union (), 2 delayed union, 1 tibial fracture, 1 wound dehiscence. Seven patients () required eight revision surgeries (): 3 bone grafts of TTO, 3 osteosyntheses, 1 extensor mechanism allograft, 1 wound revision. The functional scores and the knee flexion were significantly improved after surgery: KSS knee pre op 48.8±17 versus post op 79.6±20 (p< 0.001); KSS function pre op 37.6±21 versus post op 70.2±30 (p< 0.001); flexion pre op 81.5°±33 versus post op 93°±29 (p=0.004). (n=132) of patients had no extension deficit. No risk factor of failure of the procedure was highlighted. Conclusion: TTO during RTKA is an efficient procedure to improve knee exposure, with a high bone healing rate, despite significant specific complications. Functional outcomes are improved at mid term.NotesPaper #46Tibial Tubercule Osteotomy in Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty: Contemporary Outcomes in 135 Knees Cecile Batailler, MD, PhD, Nicolas Cance, MD, Robin Canetti, MD, Arman Vahabi, MD, Elvire Servien, MD, PhD, Sebastien Lustig, MD, PhD www.AAHKS.org/Meeting71Introduction: Perceived surgeon workload of performing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is poorly understood and variable in nature. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA TLX) survey was developed to quantify subjective experience following aviation and has been applied to healthcare fields. NASA TLX measures workload across 6 domains (mental, physical, temporal, performance, effort, and frustration). Our purpose is to: 1) quantify the workload endured by surgeons who are performing primary and revision TKA and 2) compare these values in relationship to their Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) compensation.Methods: A prospective observational cohort of 5 fellowship trained adult reconstruction surgeons completed NASA TLX surveys following conclusion of primary TKA (CPT 27447) and revision TKA (CPT 27486 and 27487). We excluded from analysis any cases with intraoperative complication. Operative time, surgical indication, patient age, sex, body mass index and American Society of Anesthesiologist category were recorded. Final NASA TLX workloads were compared to 2021 CMS data for work relative value units. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS.Results: 70 surveys (48 primaries and 22 revisions) were completed averaging 9.6 primaries and 4.4 revisions per surgeon. All 6 NASA TLX domains were significantly higher in revision than primary TKA (p< 0.008). Revision TKA represented a increased workload compared to primary TKA (p< 0.001), primary 3.13 (IQR 2.10 5.30) vs. revision 8.67 (IQR 7.53 9.80). Subgroup analysis revealed increased workload in primary TKA for post traumatic arthritis versus primary osteoarthritis (p=0.005), 8.43 (IQR 6.75 9.18) versus 2.80 (IQR 2.00 4.27), respectively. Operative time was higher in revision versus primary TKA 118 vs 84.5 minutes (p=0.05). Post hoc power analysis demonstrated likelihood of β error <0.001. Based upon 2021 CMS data, revision TKA is compensated at 50. of the actual workload.Conclusion: Revision TKA places a significant workload upon surgeons and is disproportionately compensated by CMS.NotesPaper #47A Comparison of NASA Task Load Index in Primary and Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty Kunal S.

This study examined trends in hospital level reimbursements for revision TJA hospitalizations. Methods: The CMS Inpatient Utilization and Payment Public Use Files from 2014 to 2019 were queried for diagnostic related groups (DRGs) for revision TJA; DRG 467 (revision of hip or knee replacement with complication or comorbidity [CC]) and DRG 468 (revision of hip or knee replacement without CC or major CC). After adjusting to 2019 US dollars with the Consumer Price Index, a multiple linear mixed model regression analysis was performed. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) compared regressions from 2014 to 2019 for mean adjusted Medicare payment and mean adjusted charge submitted for these DRGs. Results: From 2014 to 2019, a total of 170,808 revision total knee and hip arthroplasty hospitalizations were billed to Medicare. The annual number of revision total knee and hip arthroplasty procedures increased by 3,121 (10.) from 29,058 in 2014 to 32,179 in 2019. After adjusting to 2019 dollars, the average Medicare payment for DRG 467 decreased by $804.37 ( 3.) from $22,821.56 in 2014 to $22,017.19 in 2019. The average Medicare payment for DRG 468 decreased by $647.33 ( 3.) from $17,951.97 in 2014 to $17,304.65 in 2019. ANCOVA showed that the average inflation adjusted Medicare payment for DRG 467 decreased at a greater rate during the study period, compared to that for DRG 468 (p=0.02). Conclusion: The decline in reimbursement for DRGs 467 and 468 from 2014 to 2019 reveals decreasing incentives for revision TJA hospitalizations. Further research should assess the efficacy of current Medicare payment algorithms and identify modifications which may provide for fair hospital level reimbursements.NotesPaper #48Declining Inflation Adjusted Medicare Hospital Reimbursement for Revision Total Joint Arthroplasty Adam A.

Kamath, MD www.AAHKS.org/Meeting73Introduction: Over the past ten years, reimbursement models and target payments have been modified in an effort to decrease costs of revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) while maintaining a high quality of care. The goal of this study was to investigate trends in revenue and costs associated with rTKA.Methods: A retrospective review was conducted investigating all patients who underwent rTKA at our large urban institution from June 1, 2011 to May 31, 2021. Demographic data as well as revenue, direct and total cost associated with each patient's hospital stay were collected. Contribution margin, a financial variable used to estimate the amount of revenue left to cover fixed costs, was calculated by subtracting direct cost from revenue. Revenue, cost and contribution margin values were recorded as percentages of 2011 values. Linear regression analysis was used to determine significance of trends and establish confidence intervals. Results: In the ten year period studied, 1601 patients were identified with complete revenue and cost data. Over the time period studied, there was no significant linear trend in revenue (p=0.177), contribution margin (p=0.423), or total cost (p=0.562). There was a significant upward trend in direct cost from 2011 to 2021 (Slope [ CI]: 3.49 [1.26, 4.51], p=0.003). Since 2018, total cost increased by 0. and direct cost by 9. relative to 2011 values. In the same time period, revenue decreased by 10. leading to a reduction in contribution margin of 32.. Conclusion: Since 2018 while direct and indirect costs associated with rTKA have been consistently high, revenue has steadily decreased, leading to the lowest contribution margin in over a decade. This trend is concerning and may potentially lead to decreased access to care. Reevaluation of reimbursement models for rTKA may be necessary to ensure the continued financial viability of this procedure.NotesPaper #49Trends in Revenue and Cost for Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty Thomas H.

PJI has moved to be the main cause of failure of TKA and THA based on AJRR and numerous other joint registries. There are numerous issues with prevention, diagnosis and treatment of PJI. The symposium has assembled recognized experts in the field of orthopedic infections to discuss the current issues related to PJI. The speakers will cover clinically pertinent topics related to prevention, diagnosis and treatment of PJI. The format of presentation will be based on FAQ. Clinically relevant questions that we all face in our practice on a daily basis will be presented, responses (based on evidence as much as possible) and supportive citations will be provided. Questions like should I screen patients for MRSA, should joint replacement be performed in a laminar air flow operating room, what tests do I need to perform on the synovial aspirate, what antibiotics and how much do I add to cement spacer, and so on will be discussed.Learning Objectives:1.Discuss current issues related to PJI.2.Review prevention, diagnosis and treatment options.3.Identify practical, evidence based approaches to addressing PJI.Outline:Introduction Javad Parvizi, MD, FRCSPrevention of PJI: Answering All the FAQ Related to Prevention from Nasal Decolonization to Laminar Flow Gregory G.

The objective of this study was to characterize the risk of developing a postoperative periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after TJA when an endoscopic procedure is done within 12 months of the index surgery. Methods: Using the PearlDiver database, patients who underwent an endoscopic procedure (colonoscopy or EGD) within 12 months after primary TJA were identified and matched in a 1:1 fashion based on procedure (primary TKA vs. THA), age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and smoking status with patients who did not undergo endoscopy. The impact of timing of endoscopy relative to TJA on postoperative outcomes was assessed. Pre operative comorbidity profiles and 1 year complications were compared. Statistical analysis included chi squared tests and multivariate logistic regression with outcomes considered significant at p< 0.05. Results: A total of 142,055 patients who underwent endoscopy within 12 months following TJA (96,804 TKA and 45,251 THA) were identified and matched. Univariate testing revealed that for patients undergoing primary TJA, endoscopy within 12 months resulted in increased rates of PJI (TKA: 2. vs. 2., p< .001; THA: 2. vs. 2., p=0.494). Multivariate analysis revealed that endoscopy within 2 months following TKA and 1 month of THA was associated with a significantly increased odds of periprosthetic joint infection (OR: 1.29 [1.08 1.53]; p=.004; OR: 1.41 [1.01 1.90]; p=0.033, respectively). Patients who underwent endoscopy at later time points were not at significantly greater risk of developing these complications.Conclusion: Postoperative endoscopy (colonoscopy and EGD) within 12 months of TJA increases the odds of PJI; however if done within 2 months of TKA and 1 month of THA it significantly increases the odds of developing a PJI. This data suggests that invasive endoscopic procedures should be delayed as above.NotesPaper #50Invasive GI Endoscopy Within 2 Months of TJA Increases the Risk for Periprosthetic Joint Infection Enrico M.
