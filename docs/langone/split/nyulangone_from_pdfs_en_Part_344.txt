any ladder. Where the work does not allow 3 points of contact to be maintained on the ladder, another more stable work platform (e.g. bakers scaffold) shall be used. • All construction personnel shall be protected against falls from height greater than 6 feet at all times utilizing the hierarchy of controls. Use of a fall arrest system is a last resort and shall only be implemented where no other practical means (e.g. guardrail, aerial lift, or scaffold) exists. A controlled access zone shall be established wherever the potential for falling persons, tools or materials exists. Workers at height shall tether their tools. • The contractor shall properly handle, and dispose of, hazardous waste on site in accordance with the NYULH Hazardous Waste from Contractors policy 108a. Typical waste encountered or created during the demolition project includes: Fluorescent bulbs (mercury) Lighting ballasts (PCBs) Smoke detectors (radioactive isotopes) Aerosol cans Signatory Name Signature Date Project Manager Contractor’s competent person Program Director Vice President EH&S Safety Policy 145, Appendix B Safety Policy 145, Appendix B Safety Policy 145, Appendix C ILSM Risk Assessment for Routine Work By Facilities Maintenance Employees Revised: January 6, 2020 Interim Life Safety Measure (ILSM) Comment Evacuate the building, or notify the fire department and implement a fire watch. Not required: routine work typically doesn’t meet requirements for implementing a fire watch (refer to NYULH ILS Program Section 4.0) or evacuation. Post signs identifying alternate exits. Not required: scale and duration of work typically doesn’t affect existing exits. Inspect exits in affected areas on a daily basis. Not required: scale and duration of work typically doesn’t affect existing exits. Provide temporary but equivalent fire alarm and detection systems for use when a fire system is impaired. Not required: routine work does not impair existing fire alarm and detection monitor systems. Provide additional fire fighting equipment. Required for hot work, as per NYULH Hot Work program. Use temporary construction partitions that are smoke tight and made of noncombustible or limited combustible material that will not contribute to the development or spread of fire. Not required: scale and duration of work typically doesn’t require construction partitions and/or does not increase the risk of fire. Increase surveillance of buildings, grounds, and equipment, giving special attention to construction areas and storage, excavation, and field offices. Not required: scale and duration of work typically doesn’t impact extended areas to require increased surveillance. Enforce storage, housekeeping, and debris removal practices that reduce the building’s flammable and combustible fire load to the lowest feasible level. Included in SOPs and standard safety practices. Provide additional training to those who work in the hospital on the use of fire fighting equipment. Not required: routine work is not expected to increase the risk of fire to necessitate additional training. All NYULH employees complete annual Emergency Management and Workplace Safety Training, which includes training on the use of firefighting equipment. Conduct one additional fire drill per shift per quarter. Not required: scale and duration of work does not necessitate additional drills. Inspect and test temporary systems monthly, and document the completion dates of the tests. Not required: routine work does not impair existing systems. Provide education to promote awareness of building deficiencies, construction hazards, and temporary measures implemented to maintain fire safety. Not required: routine work is not expected to create building deficiencies, construction hazards or requirements for temporary fire safety measures. All NYULH employees complete annual Emergency Management and Workplace Safety Training, which includes training on the use of firefighting equipment. Train those who work in the hospital to compensate for impaired structural or compartmental fire safety features. Not required: routine work is not expected to impair structural or compartmental fire safety features. Where work may create penetrations, additional measures are required, as per the Above Ceiling and Barrier Integrity Permit. Implement other appropriate interim life safety measures (ILSMs). SOPs for routine work include processes for maintaining life safety and implementing adequate ILSMs to address life safety risks (e.g., related to egress, hot work, compressed gases) that may arise during work. Comment: Routine work performed by Facilities maintenance employees (e.g., plumbing, electrical, painting) is typically small scale, involving minimal disturbance of fire safety features. When maintenance employees breach fire barriers, e.g., by penetrating walls or removing doors, they install temporary barriers. Based on the scale and duration of routine maintenance work, the standard safety precautions that are implemented as per the ILS Program, and the specific measures included in routine task SOPs, existing measures are typically sufficient and additional ILSM are not required for routine work.

Will all required exits be free and unobstructed? E.g., no construction materials, equipment, or debris block free use of all exits adjacent to the construction site or impacted by the project. All existing exit signs will remain in place and operational. 2. Will any exterior access points to the building be blocked? E.g., access to emergency departments, entrances, and exit discharges will be maintained free of obstruction, storage, or other impediments. 3. Will any fire alarm systems & suppression systems be compromised and/or altered? Any temporary system must be tested monthly. A fire watch & fire dept. notification must be implemented when fire systems are compromised for more than 4 hours in a 24 hour period. 4. Will there be a need to erect construction partitions that are smoke tight, fire resistant, non combustible, slab to slab, and wall to wall? 5. Will any additional fire extinguishers and equipment be necessary & provided on site? Equipment must be functional and tests and inspections are up to date. 6. Will the Smoking prohibition need to be communicated, monitored and enforced? 7. Will construction storage need to be minimized and housekeeping & debris removal policies communicated, monitored and enforced? 8. Will additional fire drills be necessary for staff in affected areas and/or within construction area (contractor staff)? 9. Will surveillance of the area be necessary? 10. Will any additional training of staff and/or contractors be necessary to compensate for impaired structural or compartmental features of fire safety? 11.
