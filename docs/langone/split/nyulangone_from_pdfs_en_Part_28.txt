END OF BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SUBSECTION NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines CLOSE OUT PACKAGE Real Estate Development and Facilities 571 2023 CLOSE OUT PACKAGE At the end of a project, close out packages are to be completed and submitted to RED+F per the Substantial Completion and Project Closeout Checklists shown below. The goal is to have all projects closed 120 days after the first user has moved in. The A/E Team shall request the latest version of these checklists from the RED+F PM at time of close out. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines CLOSE OUT PACKAGE Real Estate Development and Facilities 572 2023 NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PHOTOGRAPHY Real Estate Development and Facilities 573 2023 PHOTOGRAPHY The RED+F Project Manager shall engage a professional photographer pre approved by the Design Studio to photograph the project after construction is complete and before move in. The cost of this shall be included in the Project Budget. A professional photographer may also be engaged by the Architect to photograph the project. The Architect shall request pre approval from NYU Langone Health of the photographer they wish to use. The RED+F PM and GC/CM shall allocate sufficient time in the schedule to professionally photograph the project. The time shall be clearly shown on the project schedule. The length of time needed will be based on the size and scope of the project. At a minimum two days will be allocated for spaces up to 50,000 GSF. One more day shall be allocated for each additional 50,000 GSF. Final photography must be scheduled as follows:  After construction is complete and no contractors are on the premises  After final cleaning has occurred  Before any move in preparation has begun All the major public spaces and architecturally important components shall be photographed sufficiently to show the scope of the project. Final high resolution files shall be provided to the Design Studio at RED+F via the RED+F PM without charge to NYU Langone. Below are a few examples: NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines PHOTOGRAPHY Real Estate Development and Facilities 574 2023 NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines POST OCCUPANCY EVALUATIONS Real Estate Development and Facilities 575 2023 POST OCCUPANCY EVALUATIONS RED+F is continually seeking to improve the Design and Construction process of the built environment and has established a Built Environment Improvement Cycle. The cycle, which consists of Design Construction Occupancy Evaluation and back to Design, allows for continual improvement of the built environment by establishing a Post Occupancy Evaluation phase. The Post Occupancy Evaluation phase occurs after the users have moved in and utilized the space for a certain period of time, typically about a year. The intent of the Post Occupancy Evaluation is to provide feedback on the design and general performance of materials and furniture over a period of time. The RED+F Design Studio performs the Post Occupancy Evaluation. It is important the same group perform the evaluation in order to maintain a consistent basis of analysis between projects. Results of Post Occupancy Evaluations are then used to inform Project Teams and update the Design Guidelines. For example, materials and furniture that are not holding up well are removed from the Design Guidelines. Materials and furniture that are not part of the Design Guidelines but were approved for a particular project and have been holding up well are considered for inclusion in the Design Guidelines. This process reduces maintenance costs and streamlines the Design process. Built Environment Improvement Cycle DesignConstructionOccupancyEvaluationNYU Langone Health Design Guidelines POST OCCUPANCY EVALUATIONS Real Estate Development and Facilities 576 2023 POST OCCUPANCY EVALUATION FORM The intent of the Design Post Occupancy Evaluation Form is to provide feedback on the overall design and general performance of materials and furniture over a period of time.
