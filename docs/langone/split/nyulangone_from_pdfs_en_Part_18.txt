Revised: 2/2024 Faculty Group Practice Financial Policies and Acknowledgement Thank you for choosing NYU Langone Health for your healthcare. We appreciate that you have entrusted us with your medical needs and we are committed to providing you with the best service possible. Because healthcare benefits and coverage options have become increasingly complex, we have developed this financial policy to help you better understand your responsibilities as a patient. We will do our best to assist you with understanding your proposed treatment and in answering questions related to submitting your insurance claim for reimbursement. Your health insurance policy is a contract between you and your health insurance company or your employer. Please note it is your responsibility to know if your insurance has specific rules or regulations, such as the need for referrals, pre certifications, pre authorizations, limits on outpatient charges, and any requirements for specific physicians, labs and/or hospitals to use. You should be knowledgeable of any deductibles, copayments, and/or coinsurance. This applies to all payors regardless of whether or not our physicians participate. If you are uncertain about your current health insurance policy benefits you should contact your plan to learn the details about your benefits, out of pocket fees, and coverage limits. Address Change It is important that we have your correct address information on file. Please advise us anytime there is any change to your address, telephone or other contact information. Insurance Coverage Please provide us with your current insurance plan information at the time of each scheduling and/ or notify us of any changes. We will request a copy of your insurance card to keep on file. Please provide any required referrals or authorizations, in advance of your appointment or service. If you do not provide these before care is provided, you will be responsible for the cost of the care. When in doubt, contact your plan directly for clarification. Our doctors participate with many insurance plans but participation differs by provider. You can see a list of plans that our physicians participate with on our website Find a Doctor(http://nyulangone.org/doctors). Before your appointment, please contact your insurance to be sure your doctor is in network and the services are covered under your plan. You are expected to pay your co payment and any co insurance and/or deductible amounts, if known, at the time of service. If your doctor is out of network, you will be billed for the costs of care. NYU Langone Health, your treating physicians and their respective designees, will use and disclose your health information for all purposes necessary for treatment, payment and health care operations, including but not limited to release of information requested by your insurance company (or carrier) and any information necessary for discharge planning purposes. If you do not want a claim submitted, please let us know at any time. You will be required to pay for your services in advance. You will also be required to complete a separate form. Missed Appointments • Most office visits require a one business day cancellation notice. • Procedures and surgeries may require two business days or more, please confirm with the practice directly. Weekends and holidays are not considered business days. • If you miss your appointment, or do not cancel within the required timeframe, additional fees may apply: Office Visit: $50 New Patient Visit: $75 Second Office Visit $75 Procedure/Surgery Per Dept Policy Non Medical Fees You may be responsible for additional fees such as: • Returned Checks • Completion of medical records requests • Completing disability forms • Completing medical clearance forms Out of Network Providers If your doctor is not in your insurance plan, the following apply: • You will sign a separate financial agreement • You will be quoted an estimated fee before services/procedures are performed. • Full payment is due prior to, or at the time of service for office visits. • A deposit is required prior to the date of service for elective surgeries and procedures. • Even if you have out of network benefits, you are ultimately responsible for the full fee charged. We will provide you with an itemized receipt so you may self submit to your insurance for reimbursement. Revised: 2/2024 Uninsured / Self pay Patients / Non Covered Services • If you have no medical insurance coverage, or do not have benefits for an item or service under the health plan, you will receive a Good Faith Estimate ahead of your visit with your estimated responsibility. • We may not know the full extent of services being provided this is only an estimate. • You are responsible to pay the estimate amount at time of the visit. • Payment of any balance is expected upon receiving a bill Other Bills You may receive services from doctors or other providers who are involved in your care who you may not see face to face such as anesthesia, radiology testing and pathology. These doctors provide vital services. There may be additional charges for these services. In addition, you may receive in patient or outpatient hospital care at NYU Langone Hospitals. If so, you will receive a hospital bill for those services. Hospital bills are separate from our doctor services.

A PATIENT GUIDE TO Gamma KnifeRadiosurgeryDepartments of Neurosurgery and Radiation OncologyGamma Knife® radiosurgery is the most established form of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), an important approach for treating brain tumors, blood vessel malformations, and other brain disorders. With this approach, the skull is not opened and no incision is needed; instead, it uses MRI or other high resolution imaging to make a 3D picture of the targeted part of the brain. Then, the area is treated with many small beams of radiation, delivered with robotic precision, instead of a scalpel. Gamma Knife® has been considered the gold standard for radiosurgery, since it is used for the brain only, and has no moving parts to deliver the radiation. It has the longest track record in treating these conditions with published validation, and is the most accurate type of brain radiosurgery. We believe that the Gamma Knife® procedure’s use of a head frame is one of the key reasons for its excellent long term results, since it most precisely irradiates the target tissue. We take care to keep patients safe and comfortable throughout the procedure, moving them in and out of the radiation unit, and focusing on the targeted area. In selected patients, a head mask is used instead of a head frame for fixation.The Gamma Knife ICONTMThe Gamma Knife® system installed at the Center for Advanced Radio surgery has advanced patient treatment and safety features. All mem bers of our staff have extensive training and experience. The team at NYU Langone Medical Center can non invasively treat multiple brain le sions at the same time—in one procedure done in one day. It is the most efficient system available.Gamma Knife® HistoryWhen the Gamma Knife® was first introduced in the United States in 1987, there were only five such units in the world. Dr. Douglas Kondzi olka worked with that unit beginning in 1989. In 1997, Drs. John Golfinos and Bernardine Donahue established the first Gamma Knife center in the New York metropolitan area at NYU Langone. In 2012, Dr. Kondziolka, director of the Center for Advanced Radiosurgery and one of the most published researchers in the field, joined the NYU Langone team, and he has participated in refining the Gamma Knife’s® design. In 2016, NYU Langone became the first center in the region to have the Icon Unit.Patient Benefits: Safety and EffectivenessGamma Knife® radiosurgery is a non invasive type of brain surgery (done without opening the skull). It allows affected tissue to be targeted with great precision while sparing healthy tissue around the treatment area. Since a surgical incision is not needed, the risks associated with open brain surgery are reduced. Patients are typically sedated without general anesthesia and can communicate during treatment. As a result, patients who undergo Gamma Knife radiosurgery are less likely to have complications, and tend to report back with positive outcomes.Because radiosurgery is less invasive, it typically leaves no scar. While patients must come in early to register at the hospital, most are finished in time for lunch. Although individual patient outcomes may vary, patients can often resume their normal activities the day after treatment. In contrast, open brain surgery typically requires a hospital stay of several days or more. By avoiding this hospital stay, radiosurgery helps lower treatment costs. Before TreatmentYour doctor will explain the Gamma Knife® radiosurgery procedure to you, discuss other treatment options and their associated risks, and give you the chance to ask any questions that you might have. Once you have decided on radiosurgery, you will be asked to sign a consent form to do the procedure. Please read this form carefully and ask questions if something is not clear. You will be asked to avoid eating or drinking for eight (8) hours before the proce dure, starting after midnight. Depending on your wishes, you may also receive a sedative before the procedure to help you relax.Attaching the Head FrameThe head frame acts as a “guiding device” to ensure that the Gamma Knife® beams are focused exactly where treatment is needed. This way, the target is kept still during both imaging and treatment. Radiosurgery depends on highly accurate images, and total head immobilization in a frame gives the clearest images. The aluminum frame will be attached to your head using four pins, two in the front and two in the back. These pin sites will be cleaned, and you will receive four small injections of local anesthetic to numb the sites. Plastic ear bars will temporarily be placed in each ear to balance the frame while it is being attached. Once applied, the frame feels tight for just a minute or two, then will be comfortable. If a mask is used for head fixation, it will be made for you the morning of the procedure.Imaging and PlanningAfter the head frame is in place, you will un dergo an MRI, CT scan, or angiogram, de pending on your diagnosis. These radiology scans are obtained to precisely locate the size, shape, and location of your tumor, le sion, or abnormality. An indicator box will be attached to the head frame. Once the imag ing studies are completed, you can relax while your neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, and physicist use the information from the im ages to plan your treatment. This is usually the longest phase of the procedure, and may take from 15 minutes to several hours.TreatmentOnce the treatment plan is final, you will be brought into the Gamma Knife® treatment room. You will be moved onto the couch and your head frame attached comfortably to the table. You will then enter the domed section of the unit, where your treatment will begin. The computerized delivery system sends the planned radiation di rectly and precisely to the areas of concern us ing robotic precision. This treatment is silent and totally painless. Often, you can listen to music of your choice during the treatment. Treatment time will vary from patient to patient, depending on the size and number of areas to be treated. It can be as short as 15 minutes, or as long as two to three hours.After TreatmentWhen the radiosurgery is completed, the head frame will be removed and the pin sites cleaned and covered with bandages. If a pin site continues to bleed, a small stitch may be used. You may also be given Decadron (dexamethasone), a medication to prevent swelling at the target area. Almost all patients are sent home the same day soon after the procedure. Some may be transferred to our hospital unit, where you will be mon itored overnight and discharged the following morning. Before you leave the hospital, a nurse will review your discharge instructions with you, including permitted activity, medication, pin site care, and, most impor tantly, follow up care. In the months that follow, a fol low up program will be created just for you that may include office visits, imaging studies, or other tests. For patients who live a significant distance from New York, we will work closely with your chosen doctors at home.Patient SelectionThe selection of patients who are the best candidates for Gamma Knife® radiosurgery involves a team of neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, and other specialists. Selection for Gamma Knife® radio surgery is made based on diagnos tic testing, tissue diagnosis, your age, the size and location of each tumor or lesion, the number of le sions or tumors present, prior ther apy, and, of course, your own goals.Brain Metastases (Metastatic Brain Tumors)The most common type of brain tumors are brain metastases that develop outside of the original site of the cancer. Brain metastases can result from many different kinds of cancer, including lung, breast, melanoma, colon, and kidney cancer. Treatment options include surgical resection, Gamma Knife® radiosurgery, and external beam radiation therapy. Gamma Knife® radiosurgery is preferred for patients with smaller tumors and without major symptoms. It can also be used in patients with more than one tumor. Our neurosurgeons, who have published extensively on brain metastasis management, work closely with our oncologists and radiation oncologists to care for patients with brain metastases. We have cared for more than 5,000 patients with these tumors, and have found that Gamma Knife® radiosurgery can control tumors in 80 95 percent of patients. We can treat multiple tumors at the same time, and if new tumors develop in other locations, these can usually be treated as well. Though whole brain radiation is used less often today, it can still be useful for some patients.Dose plan for a brain metastasisAcoustic Neuromas (Vestibular Schwannomas)Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors near the skull base that involve the nerves responsible for facial movement, hearing, and balance. Sometimes known as vestibular schwannomas, they grow from the vestibular nerve, which controls balance, and spread out into the auditory canal, through which the cranial nerves exit the skull. Common symptoms of acoustic neuromas include hearing loss usually the first symptom as well as tinnitus (ringing in the ear), balance problems, and facial weakness, pain or numbness. Though larger acoustic neuromas can put pressure on the brainstem and cause a wide variety of conditions and symptoms, such as a buildup of spinal fluid called hydrocephalus, most are small under three centimeters in diameter making such problems unlikely. However, some patients can have this problem even with smaller tumors.Treatment options include surgical resection, Gamma Knife® radiosurgery, radiation therapy, or continued observation. Gamma Knife® radiosurgery has become a common treatment choice with good outcomes for patients with smaller tumors. The natural rate of tumor growth can vary from patient to patient. Meeting with surgeons experienced in acoustic neuroma care is important to help patients plan their care.Meningiomas Meningiomas are the most common type of benign intracranial tumors. They grow outside the brain and may cause symptoms by putting pressure on the brain. If they are located near the skull base, they can put pressure on cranial nerves. Specific symptoms caused by a meningioma depend on the size and location of the tumor.Although most meningiomas are benign and grow slowly, a small number grow more aggressively and may invade the brain.The most common treatment options for meningiomas are surgical resection and Gamma Knife® radiosurgery. Conventional external beam radiation can be used in selected meningiomas. Specific treatments are decided on a case by case basis and depend on many factors, including the size, location, and grade of the tumor, as well as the patient’s age.Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs) and FistulasArteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal tangles of arteries and veins. While many AVMs never cause any symptoms, there can be serious problems when they occur inside the brain as a cerebral AVM, in the brain’s covering (the dura) as a dural AVM, or in the spinal cord as a spinal AVM.In an AVM, the capillaries that normally exchange blood between the arteries and the veins do not develop in a certain area, and the arteries pass blood directly into the veins. Because veins do not have strong walls, over time the high blood pressure of arterial blood flow can cause these vessels to become engorged and rupture or hemorrhage, or cause seizures, headaches, or other symptoms. These symptoms typically develop between the second and fourth decades of life, but people of all ages can be affected. Half of all brain AVMs present with a brain hemorrhage, while the rest typically present as a seizure, a headache (usually one sided and migraine like), or a neurological deficit. Dose plan for an arteriovenous malformationWhile direct surgery can also eliminate AVMs, radiosurgery allows treatment in hard to reach areas with a relatively low complication rate and no need for general anesthesia. Radiosurgery is sometimes combined with endovascular embolization or resection. Radiosurgery works by closing off the abnormal blood vessels of the malformation. Eliminating the AVM flow usually occurs over a two to four year period. Dose plan for a vestibular schwannomaTrigeminal Neuralgia Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also known as tic douloureux, is a pain syndrome that occurs as one sided facial pain. A physical exam is usually normal or reveals some mild sensory loss; ma jor sensory loss suggests another cause that an MRI or other neuroimaging can identify. Medication therapy is the first choice to reduce pain. Carbamazepine (Tegretol) is considered the most effective treatment, though other op tions such as phenytoin (Dilantin), baclofen, gabapentin (Neurontin), oxcarbazepine, and clonazepam may work well for some patients. Before thinking about surgery, all trigeminal neuralgia patients should have an MRI, with a close examination of the posterior fossa, to rule out other causes of trigeminal nerve compres sion.For patients who are elderly, or those with multi ple sclerosis, recurrent MVD associated pain, or impaired hearing on the opposite side, Gamma Knife® radiosurgery is the least invasive option. Done on an outpatient basis, the procedure has benefits that grow over time. Patients com monly report pain relief that might start in the first day or two with improvement over the first month, on average and the effect on the nerve builds over several months. In our vast experi ence with this procedure, a small number only about 10 15 percent of patients have some loss of feeling in the face.Other Tumors and IndicationsGamma Knife® radiosurgery is a common choice for patients with selected pituitary tumors, pi neal tumors, hemangioblastomas, hemangio pericytomas, benign or malignant gliomas, or head and neck cancers. Radiosurgery can also be used for selected patients with behavioral disorders and movement disorders, such as ob sessive compulsive disorder or tremor. In fact, virtually every type of brain tumor has been treated using this approach. We have some of the world’s most extensive experience using this treatment, and will create a treatment plan targeted to your condition.For more information,please contact:Department of Neurosurgery 212.263.2950 Department of Radiation Oncology 212.731.5003Center for Advanced Radiosurgery 212.263.0581nyulangone.org/radiosurgeryNYU Langone Medical Center550 First AvenueNew York, NY 10016NYULANGONE.ORG


Page 1 of 3 Created: 10/2020 A Guide to Verifying Gender Affirming Surgery Benefits  Please be aware that before your first appointment with Dr. Bluebond Langner, you need to verify that your health insurance plan covers gender affirming surgery benefits.  Take the time to check your benefits! This is vital. Having accurate information helps avoid any surprise costs, charges or cancellations.  Log on to your insurance company’s portal in order to get the most accurate information. Then download your Summary of Benefits and Coverage and Certificate of Coverage (This might also be called Summary Plan Description or Evidence of Coverage. Refer to important note below).  Important note: The documents mentioned above (Summary of Benefits and Coverage, etc.) are specific to your personal health plan. Asking a friend with the same insurance company or Googling the name of your insurance company and “transgender surgery” will not give you accurate information! Most insurance companies have a variety of different plans with different benefits. As a result, you need to verify the specific benefits for your plan.  Review your certificate of coverage by searching for “gender” or “sex.” This search should lead you to a section on gender affirming surgery benefits (or exclusions).  If this section states that gender affirming surgery is covered, it should explain requirements for your surgery to be approved. For example, hormones, support letter details, etc.  You can also call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask about gender affirming surgery benefits. To make sure you get accurate information, we recommend calling multiple times and speaking to a few different representatives. Make sure you write down the name of each representative you speak with. And always make sure that you ask for a call reference number for your records! Page 2 of 3 Created: 10/2020 Questions to Ask Your Health Insurance Company Below is a list of questions you need to get answers to. Do this either by reviewing the Summary of Benefits and Coverage and Certificate of Coverage, or by calling your insurance plan and speaking to a representative. You need to do this before your consultation at NYU Langone: 1. Do I have gender affirming surgery benefits? 2. What are my co pays for consultations and office visits with surgeons? Is there a separate hospital co pay? 3. What is my deductible? Is there a different deductible for hospital stay and for seeing providers? 4. Do I then have co insurance? 5. What is my out of pocket maximum? 6. Is Dr. Bluebond Langner an in network/par provider?  Am I able to see out of network/non par providers and do I have out of network/non par benefits? Is there a deductible or out of pocket maximum separate for out of network/non par providers? 7. Do I need a referral to see a specialist? 8. What is the date every year that my deductible and out of pocket maximum reset? Is this a calendar year (January 1 to December 31) or a plan year (date range determined by plan)? If Dr. Bluebond Langner is not an in network (or non par) provider:  If Dr. Bluebond Langner is not in your insurance network, the cost of your consultation will be $262.50.

Deciding AboutA G U I D E F O R P A T I E N T S A N D F A M I L I E SNew York State Department of HealthHealth Care IntroductionWho should read this guide? This guide is for New York State patients and for those who will make health care decisions for patients. It contains information about surrogate decision making in hospitals and nursing homes. It also covers DNR orders in a health care facility, or in the community. Because this guide is about health care decision making, the word “patient” is used to refer to anyone receiving medical care. This includes a nursing home resident. This guide does not include the special rules for health care decisions made by legal guardians of persons with developmental disabilities.Can the patient or other decision maker find out about the patient’s medical condition and proposed treatment? Yes. Patients or other decision makers have a right to be fully informed by a doctor about their medical condition and the doctor’s proposed treatment. Patients must give informed consent before any non emergency treatment or procedure. Informed consent means that after information is given about the benefits and risks of treatment (as well as alternatives to the treatment) permission is given to go ahead with the treatment.Adult Patients Who Have the Ability to Make Informed DecisionsDo adult patients have a right to make their own health care decisions? Yes. Adult patients have the right to make treatment decisions for themselves as long as they have decision making capacity.What is “decision making capacity”? “Decision making capacity” is the ability to understand and appreciate the nature and consequences of proposed health care. This includes the benefits and risks of (and alternatives to) proposed health care. It also includes the ability to reach an informed decision.What if it’s unclear whether or not a patient has decision making capacity? Who decides whether or not the patient has capacity? Health care workers will assume patients have decision making capacity, unless a court has appointed a legal guardian to decide about health care. A doctor will examine the patient if there is good reason to believe the patient lacks capacity. A doctor must make the determination that a patient lacks the ability to make health care decisions. Another person will make health care decisions for the patient only after the patient’s doctor makes this determination. Do family members always make health care decisions whenever patients lack decision making capacity? No. Sometimes patients have already made a decision about a procedure or treatment before they lose the ability to decide. For example, a patient can consent to surgery that involves general anesthesia before receiving anesthesia, which would cause them to lose the ability to decide. Other times, a healthy person may suddenly lose capacity. In this case, health care may need to be given right away without consent. For example, a person may be knocked unconscious during an accident. Health care providers will provide emergency treatment without consent unless they know that a decision has already been made to refuse emergency treatment.A G U I D E F O R P A T I E N T S A N D F A M I L I E S11A G U I D E F O R P A T I E N T S A N D F A M I L I E S2Advance Directives/Health Care ProxiesWhat is an advance directive? Advance directives are written instructions about health care treatment made by adult patients before they lose decision making capacity. In New York State, the best way to protect your treatment wishes and concerns is to appoint someone you trust to decide about treatment if you become unable to decide for yourself. By filling out a form called a health care proxy, this person becomes your “health care agent.” Before appointing a health care agent, make sure the person is willing to act as your agent. Discuss with your agent what types of treatments you would or would not want if you were in the hospital and had a life threatening illness or injury. Make sure your health care agent knows your wishes about artificial nutrition and hydration (being fed though a feeding tube or IV line). You can get more information about health care proxies at: http://www.health.state.ny.us/professionals/patients/health_care_proxy/index.htm. Some patients also express specific instructions and choices about medical treatments in writing. A written statement can be included in a health care proxy, or it can be in a separate document. Some people refer to this type of advance directive as a “living will.”How do health care agents make decisions under a health care proxy? Health care agents make decisions just as if the health care agent were the patient. The health care agent makes health care decisions according to the patient’s wishes, including decisions to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment. If the patient’s wishes are not reasonably known, health care agents make health care decisions in accordance with the patient’s best interests.Can a health care agent decide to withhold or withdraw artificial nutrition or hydration (through a feeding tube or an IV line)? Health care agents can only make decisions to withhold or withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration under the health care proxy if they know the patient’s wishes about the treatment. But, the health care agent may also be able to make this type of decision in a hospital or nursing home as a surrogate from the surrogate list set forth in law.Health Care Decision Making in Hospitals and Nursing HomesHow do adult patients with decision making capacity make decisions in hospitals and nursing homes? Patients may express decisions verbally or in writing. A hospital patient or nursing home resident may not verbally make a decision to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment unless two adults witness the decision. One of the adults must be a health care practitioner at the facility. If a patient does not now have capacity to make a decision (but made a decision in the past about the proposed health care), the hospital or nursing home will act based on the patient’s previously made decision. This is true unless something occurs that the patient did not expect and the decision no longer makes sense.How are health care decisions made for a hospital patient or nursing home resident who does not have capacity? If the patient has a health care proxy, the health care agent named in the proxy makes decisions. If a patient does not have a health care proxy, a legal guardian (or the person highest in priority from the surrogate list, known as “the surrogate”) makes decisions.What is the surrogate list? Below is the surrogate list. The person who is highest in priority is listed at the top. The person with the lowest priority is at the bottom. • The spouse, if not legally separated from the patient, or the domestic partner; • A son or daughter 18 or older; • A parent; • A brother or sister 18 or older; and • A close friend.What is a “domestic partner”? A “domestic partner” is a person who: • has entered into a formal domestic partnership recognized by a local, state or national government. Or, this person has registered as a domestic partner with a registry maintained by the government or an employer; or, this person • is covered as a domestic partner under the same employment benefits or health insurance; or, this person • shares a mutual intent to be a domestic partner with the patient, considering all the facts and circumstances, such as: They live together. They depend on each other for support. They share ownership (or a lease) of their home or other property. They share income or expenses. They are raising children together. They plan on getting married or becoming formal domestic partners. They have been together for a long time.Who cannot be a domestic partner? • A parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece of the patient or the patient’s spouse. • A person who is younger than 18.Who qualifies as a “close friend”? A “close friend” is any person, 18 or older, who is a friend or relative of the patient. This person must have maintained regular contact with the patient; be familiar with the patient’s activities, health, and religious or moral beliefs; and present a signed statement to that effect to the attending doctor.What if a surrogate highest in priority is not available to make the decision? If this happens, the next available surrogate who is highest in priority makes the decision.What if a surrogate highest in priority is unable or unwilling to make the decision? In this case, another person from the surrogate list will decide. The surrogate highest in priority may designate any other person on the list to be surrogate, as long as no one higher in priority than the designated person objects.Can patients or other decision makers change their minds after they make a treatment decision? Yes. Decisions may be revoked after they are made by telling staff at the hospital or nursing home.Decisions to Withhold or Withdraw Life Sustaining Treatment in Hospitals and Nursing HomesWhat is “life sustaining treatment”? “Life sustaining treatment” means that the attending doctor believes the patient will die within a relatively short time if the patient does not get the medical treatment or procedure. CPR is always considered to be life sustaining treatment.What is CPR? CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) refers to medical procedures that try to restart a patient’s heart or breathing when the patient’s heart stops and/or the patient stops breathing. CPR may begin with something like mouth to mouth resuscitation and forceful pressure on the chest to try to restart the heart. This may not work, so CPR may also involve electric shock (defibrillation); insertion of a tube down the throat into the windpipe (intubation); and placing the patient on a breathing machine (ventilator).What is a decision to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment? A decision to withhold life sustaining treatment is deciding to refuse a treatment before it is provided. A decision to withdraw life sustaining treatment is deciding to refuse treatment already being provided. Every adult patient has the right to refuse medicine and treatment after being fully informed of (and understanding) the probable consequences of such actions.3A G U I D E F O R P A T I E N T S A N D F A M I L I E S4How would a hospital or a nursing home carry out a decision to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment? The doctor might direct staff not to provide, or to stop providing, certain medicines, treatments or procedures. This may result in the patient dying within a relatively short time. For example, the doctor might order that a ventilator, which is enabling a patient to breathe, be turned off. In order to withhold life sustaining treatment, the doctor might issue a medical order such as a: • Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order: this means do not attempt CPR when the patient’s heart stops and/or the patient stops breathing. • Do Not Intubate (DNI) Order: this means do not place a tube down the patient’s throat or connect the patient to a breathing machine (ventilator). A decision could also be made to stop (or not to start) artificial nutrition and hydration through a feeding tube or an IV. This means the facility will not give the patient liquid food or fluids through a tube inserted in the stomach or by a tube called a catheter inserted into the patient’s veins. Patients will always be offered food to eat and fluids to drink by mouth if they are able to eat and drink. Other kinds of decisions to limit medicines, treatments or procedures could also be followed (for example, stopping dialysis).Will a hospital or a nursing home ever withhold all treatment? No. Even if a patient has a DNR order or other medical order to withhold life sustaining treatment, the patient should receive medical care and treatment to relieve pain and other symptoms and to reduce suffering. Comfort care, also known as palliative care, should be available to all patients who need it.When should a patient get a DNR order? Any adult with decision making capacity may request a DNR order. However, patients and families must consult with a doctor about their diagnosis and the likely outcome of CPR. Only a doctor can sign a DNR order. A DNR order instructs health care professionals not to provide CPR for patients who want to allow natural death to occur if their heart stops and/or if they stop breathing. For example, a patient who is expecting to die from a terminal illness may want a DNR order. When successful, CPR restores heartbeat and breathing. The success of CPR depends on the patient’s overall medical condition. Age alone does not determine whether CPR will be successful. But illnesses and frailties that go along with age often make CPR less effective. When patients are seriously ill, CPR may not work or it may only partially work. This might leave the patient brain damaged or in a worse medical state than before his or her heart stopped. After CPR (depending on the patient’s medical condition), the patient may be able to be kept alive only on a breathing machine. Does a DNR order affect other treatment? No. A DNR order is only a decision about CPR chest compression, intubation and mechanical ventilation and does not relate to any other treatment. Do not resuscitate does not mean do not treat.What happens if the patient is transferred from the hospital or nursing home to another hospital or nursing home? Medical orders, including a DNR order, will continue until a health care practitioner examines the patient. If the doctor at the new facility decides to cancel the medical order, the patient or other decision maker will be told and he or she can ask that the order be entered again.Decision Making Standards for Legal Guardians and Surrogates in Hospitals and Nursing HomesHow are health care decisions made by surrogate decision makers, including legal guardians? The surrogate must make health care decisions in accordance with the patient’s wishes, including the patient’s religious and moral beliefs. If the patient’s wishes are not reasonably known, the surrogate makes decisions according to the patient’s “best interests.” To figure out what is in the “best interests” of the patient, the surrogate must consider: the dignity and uniqueness of every person; the possibility of preserving the patient’s life and preserving or improving the patient’s health; relief of the patient’s suffering; and any other concerns and values a person in the patient’s circumstances would wish to consider. In all cases, what matters is the patient’s wishes and best interests, not the surrogate’s. A G U I D E F O R P A T I E N T S A N D F A M I L I E SHealth care decisions should be made on an individual basis for each patient. Again, decisions must be consistent with the patient’s values, as well as religious and moral beliefs.Do surrogates always have authority to consent to needed treatments? Yes.Do surrogates always have authority to make decisions to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment? No. A legal guardian or a surrogate in a hospital or nursing home may decide to refuse life sustaining treatment for a patient only in the following circumstances: • Treatment would be an extraordinary burden to the patient and: the patient has an illness or injury which can be expected to cause death within six months, whether or not treatment is provided; or the patient is permanently unconscious;or • The provision of treatment would involve such pain, suffering or other burden that it would reasonably be deemed inhumane or extraordinarily burdensome under the circumstances and the patient has an irreversible or incurable condition. In a nursing home, an ethics review committee must also agree to decisions (other than DNR) based on this bullet point. In a hospital, the attending doctor or the ethics review committee must agree to a decision to withhold or withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration based on this bullet point.How are decisions about life sustaining treatment made for minors in a hospital or nursing home? The parent or guardian of a patient under 18 makes decisions about life sustaining treatment in accordance with the minor’s best interests. They take into account the minor’s wishes as appropriate under the circumstances. For a decision to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment, the minor patient must also consent if he or she has decision making capacity. It is assumed that an unmarried minor lacks decision making capacity unless a doctor determines that the patient has the capacity to decide about life sustaining treatment. Minors who are married make their own decisions, the same as adults.What if an unmarried minor patient has decision making capacity and he or she is a parent? What if he or she is 16 or older and living independently from his or her parents or guardian? Such minors can make decisions to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment on their own if the attending doctor and the ethics review committee agree.Resolving Disputes in Hospitals and Nursing HomesWhat if there are two or more persons highest in priority and they cannot agree? For example, what if the adult children are highest in priority and they disagree with one another? In this case, the hospital or nursing home staff can try to resolve the dispute by informal means. For example, more doctors, social workers or clergy could discuss the decision. Also, every hospital and nursing home must have an ethics review committee. The case may be referred to the ethics review committee for advice, a recommendation, and assistance in resolving the dispute. The hospital or nursing home must follow the decision of the surrogate that is based on the patient’s wishes, if they are known. If the patient’s wishes are not reasonably known, the hospital or nursing home must follow the decision that is in the patient’s best interests.What if a person connected with the case does not agree with the surrogate’s treatment decision? This could be the patient, a health care worker treating the patient in the hospital or nursing home or someone lower in priority on the surrogate list. A G U I D E F O R P A T I E N T S A N D F A M I L I E S5 Again, the hospital or nursing home staff can try to resolve the dispute by informal means. If that is not successful, the person who disagrees could request help from the ethics review committee. The person challenging the decision maker can ask that the ethics review committee try to resolve the dispute. This person could present information and opinions to the committee. The ethics review committee can provide advice and make a recommendation, and can provide assistance in resolving the dispute.Are the recommendations and advice of the ethics review committee binding? No, the recommendations and advice of the ethics review committee are advisory and non binding, except for three very specific types of decisions. The ethics review committee must agree with the decision in the following three situations: • A surrogate decides to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment (other than CPR) from a patient in a nursing home. The patient is not expected to die within six months and is not permanently unconscious. In this situation, the ethics review committee must agree to the following. The patient has a condition that can’t be reversed or cured. Also, the provision of life sustaining treatment would involve such pain, suffering or other burden that it would reasonably be deemed inhumane or extraordinarily burdensome under the circumstances. • A surrogate decides to withhold or withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration from a patient in a hospital. The attending doctor objects. The patient is not expected to die within six months and is not permanently unconscious. In this situation, the ethics review committee must agree to the following. The patient has a condition that can’t be reversed or cured. Also, artificial nutrition and hydration would involve such pain, suffering or other burden that it would reasonably be deemed inhumane or extraordinarily burdensome under the circumstances. • In a hospital or nursing home, an ethics review committee must approve the decision of an unmarried, emancipated minor to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment without the consent of a parent or guardian. In these three situations, life sustaining treatment will not be withheld or withdrawn unless the ethics review committee approves.What does it mean when the recommendations and advice of the ethics review committee are advisory and non binding? This means that the surrogate highest in priority can make a legal health care decision. He or she can do this even if another person lower in priority on the surrogate list or others continue to disagree with the surrogate decision maker.What if the hospital or nursing home has a policy based on religious or moral beliefs that prevents the facility from honoring a health care decision? When possible, the facility must inform patients or family members of this policy before or at admission. When the decision is made, the facility must cooperate in transferring the patient to another facility that is reasonably accessible and willing to honor the decision. Meanwhile, the facility must honor the decision, unless a court rules otherwise. If the decision goes against one health care practitioner’s religious or moral beliefs, the patient must be promptly put under the care of another health care practitioner.6A G U I D E F O R P A T I E N T S A N D F A M I L I E SState of New York Department of Health5/101503DNR Orders Outside the Hospital or Nursing HomeIf a patient is not in a hospital or nursing home, how can the patient get a DNR order or DNI order? The patient’s doctor can write a DNR order on a standard form that has been approved by the New York State Department of Health: DOH 3474 (Nonhospital Order Not to Resuscitate). A doctor can also sign a nonhospital DNI order in addition to the nonhospital DNR order using the DOH 5003 form called MOLST (Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment). EMS, home care agencies and hospices must honor these orders.If the patient is at home with a nonhospital DNR order, or MOLST orders, what happens if a family member or friend calls an ambulance? If the patient has a nonhospital DNR order and it is shown to emergency personnel, they will not try to resuscitate the patient or take the patient to a hospital emergency room for CPR. They may still take the patient to the hospital for other needed care, including comfort care to relieve pain and reduce suffering.What happens to a DNR order issued in the hospital or nursing home if the patient is transferred from the hospital or nursing home to home care? The orders issued for the patient in a hospital or nursing home may not apply at home. The patient or other decision maker must get a nonhospital DNR order on the DOH 3474 form or the DOH 5003 MOLST form. If the patient leaves the hospital or nursing home without a nonhospital DNR order, it can be issued by a doctor at home.7A G U I D E F O R P A T I E N T S A N D F A M I L I E S

I think the biggest problem we have right now is access to primary care and I think that is going to be the biggest hurdle that this facility is going to have, that people have problems getting into primary care to be seen and to be referred.Patient 17/27/2024 residents of the project’s service areaNoZoom interviewYesYesyesThoughts on having the ambulatory service in White Plains is gonna be a plus for everyone coming north, coming South, East, West, it'll take the burden and the fare of people going into the city to be in White Plains. It's more relaxed and the same service that we're gonna have, I think it's a plus all around for everything, anything you're gonna do. White Plains is definitely a place to be in.Brittaney Jones AlleyneBroadview at Purchase College Senior Living9 Jul community leadersYesZoom interviewYesYesNoPatient 214 Aug residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesNoPatient 38/14/2024 residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesNoPatient 48/15/2024 residents of the project’s service areaNoZoom interviewYesYesYesFor me, personally, I would love it if there was a surgery center here so that if I. needed surgery down the line, I didn’t have to go to Manhattan, care close to home.Patient 58/16/2024 residents of the project’s service areayesPhone interviewYesYesNoPatient 68/20/2024 residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesYesI think it’s a good idea, but as I said, then you can’t complete the deal in White Plains, it’s not worth it. To me, it’s not worth it. I am very happy that I’m able to see my doctor in White Plains, and he has office hours there once a week, and I can go there, which is great. But the initial if I went there, and then I was told I had to go into Langone in the city. Now fortunately, we can do that. But maybe next year wouldn’t have been able to do that. I would have checked, probably, ahead of time if the whole procedure would be taken care of at White Plains. If I couldn’t, I wouldn’t go there initially at all.Patient 78/21/2024 residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesNoPatient 88/28/2024 residents of the project’s service areaYesPhone interviewYesYesYesThe staff from the clerk to the medical staff has all been a pleasant experience.Maria Gbur9/10/2024 public health expertsYesPhone interviewYesYesYesI’m hoping it also has some sports medicine orthopedics that are geared toward sports medicine. That would be helpful in this area.

Executive summary of project (250 words max) NYU Langone Health (NYULH) proposes adding a location for orthopedic services in Westchester County at 4 Westchester Park Drive, West Harrison NY 10604. This will enable patients in and closer to Westchester to access orthopedic services closer to home. Currently, NYULH patients residing in Westchester and as well as some patients outside the service area have to travel to Manhattan for orthopedic services, which creates time and cost burdens for patients. Traveling to and within Manhattan is burdensome for all patients and some medically underserved groups who face the greatest burdens from traveling to Manhattan. Once the project is completed, patients will still receive care from their same providers. 8. Executive summary of HEIA findings (500 words max) The stakeholder engagement revealed multiple overall benefits of the orthopedic ambulatory services being expanded to Westchester. These benefits include reduced travel time because of access to local services; easier access to surgery in terms of parking and building access; and reduced or eliminated costs in travel fees, such as gas, parking fees, and toll fees. While this applies to all patient populations, including the racial and ethnic minorities and women who, similar to previous years, are expected to comprise a significant portion of the patient population, feedback from our meaningful engagement showed a significant impact on people with disabilities and September 2024 3 mobility issues (e.g., in need of hip or knee replacement), older adults, low income people, and persons living in rural areas. Stakeholders expressed a desire to have imaging, testing, and rehabilitation services onsite at the proposed ambulatory surgery center. Other stakeholders emphasized ways to ensure greater access by providing supportive services, partnering with providers that serve medically underserved groups, having evening and weekend hours, and making financing options available. SECTION B: ASSESSMENT STEP 1 SCOPING 1. Demographics of service area Please see attached the completed “Scoping Table” Sheets 1 and 2 in the HEIA Data Tables provided with this assessment. 2. Medically underserved groups in the service area: Please select the medically underserved groups in the service area that will be impacted by the project:  Low income people  Racial and ethnic minorities ❑ Immigrants  Women ❑ Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or other than cisgender people  People with disabilities  Older adults ❑ Persons living with a prevalent infectious disease or condition  Persons living in rural areas ❑ People who are eligible for or receive public health benefits ❑ People who do not have third party health coverage or have inadequate third party health coverage ❑ Other people who are unable to obtain health care ❑ Not listed (specify): 3. Sources of information for identification of medically underserved: For each medically underserved group (identified above), what source of information was used to determine the group would be impacted? What information or data was difficult to access or compile for the completion of the Health Equity Impact Assessment? We leveraged the Applicant’s internal data to identify the medically underserved groups that would be impacted by the project. While robust internal data is collected, it did not September 2024 4 reflect disability status. For this information, we consulted publicly available data related to these groups in the broader service area. • Low income people internal electronic medical record data, American Community Survey, 2021 • Racial and ethnic minorities internal electronic medical record data, American Community Survey, 2021 • Women internal electronic medical record data, American Community Survey, 2021 • People with disabilities American Community Survey, 2021 • Older adults internal electronic medical record data, American Community Survey, 2021 • Persons living in rural areas American Community Survey, 2021 Overall, a combination of internal and external data sources was used to identify the medically underserved groups impacted by the proposed project. 4. Unique health needs or quality of life of medically underserved groups: How does the project impact the unique health needs or quality of life of each medically underserved group (identified above)? Currently, NYULH patients residing in Westchester and as well as some patients outside the service area have to travel to Manhattan for orthopedic services. The Applicant has multiple sites in Manhattan for orthopedic services. The travel time can be significant for those patients. For example, a patient from Peekskill, NY would have to drive over 3 hours roundtrip to get to and from the NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital at 301 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003, not including potential traffic, time to park, and time to get to and from their appointment. In addition to the time patients must spend traveling to and within Manhattan, they must spend money for gas, tolls, and parking. As described below, traveling to and within Manhattan is especially burdensome for low income people, patients with disabilities and limited mobility, older adults, persons living in rural areas, and racial and ethnic minorities and women. The proposed project will add a location for orthopedic services in Westchester at 4 Westchester Park Drive, West Harrison NY 10604. This will enable patients in and closer to Westchester to access care closer to home, while still scheduling appointments and receiving care with the same department and their same providers. The proposed changes will improve the patient experience for all medically underserved groups by facilitating care and access closer to the patients’ home and reducing the need to travel to Manhattan. We expect the greatest positive impact of this new location will be experienced by: September 2024 5 • Low income people who will not have to spend excessive time traveling to Manhattan—and therefore, lose income through missed work—or spend additional money on gas, tolls, and parking. • People with disabilities or limited mobility and older adults will not have the burden of traveling long distances or navigating Manhattan for services. At the new site, they will have access to valet parking and sidewalks and curbs that are more accessible to those that require mobility support (e.g., wheelchairs, canes, walkers, etc.). • Persons living in rural areas who often have limited or no access to services where they live will also have access to services closer to where they live. • Racial and ethnic minorities and women in the service area who will benefit from having access to orthopedic services closer to home. Of the patients residing in the service area for Calendar Year 2022 (CY22) and seen at NYULH for outpatient orthopedics services, identified as racial minorities, identified as ethnic minorities, and identified as women. 5. Current and expected utilization by medically underserved groups: To what extent do the medically underserved groups (identified above) currently use the service(s) or care impacted by or as a result of the project? To what extent are the medically underserved groups (identified above) expected to use the service(s) or care impacted by or as a result of the project? Of the patients residing in Westchester County and seen at NYULH for outpatient orthopedics services in CY22, identified as racial minorities, identified as ethnic minorities, and identified as women. According to SPARCs market data for Westchester County in CY22, of the ambulatory surgery patients receiving musculoskeletal surgery, 9. of patients rely on Medicaid as their primary source of payment (with Medicaid as primary source of payment as a proxy for the low income population). The Applicant expects that improvements to patient satisfaction will attract new patients to NYULH, and it is anticipated that service utilization by all medically underserved groups will not decrease. As noted above, internal data limitations include a lack of robust data related to people with disabilities. Therefore, we are unable to quantify current or expected utilization specific to this group. 6. Availability of similar services or care: What is the availability of similar services or care at other facilities in or near the Applicant's service area? The following facilities are licensed to provide ambulatory surgery in Westchester County.

Historical and projected market shares: What are the historical and projected market shares of providers offering similar services or care in the Applicant's service area? For the purposes of this project, market share was determined with procedure product line for musculoskeletal ambulatory surgery for patients in the project service area of Westchester County. Based on SPARCS data from New York State Department of Health, NYULH held on average 2. 2. of the orthopedic market in Westchester from 2021 to 2023.

Between 2021 and 2023, adult orthopedic volume decreased by 4. in Westchester County. Facilities serving patients in the service area observed varied trends in patient September 2024 7 volumes from CY21 to CY22 to CY23, with some experiencing increases while others saw declines. Additionally, market share assumptions are difficult to ascertain because a hospital’s market position in any given service line depends largely on the activities of other hospitals (e.g., service line expansions, closures), which generally cannot be predicted. 8. Performance of obligations: Summarize the performance of the Applicant in meeting its obligations, if any, under Public Health Law § 2807 k (General Hospital Indigent Care Pool) and federal regulations requiring the provision of uncompensated care, community services, and/or access by minorities and people with disabilities to programs receiving federal financial assistance. Will these obligations be affected by implementation of the project? If yes, please describe. The obligations under Public Health Law § 2807 k (General Hospital Indigent Care Pool) and federal regulations apply to the Applicant, and the organization is currently meeting its obligations to the best of the Independent Entity’s knowledge. As a non profit healthcare system, the Applicant provides care regardless of a patient’s ability to pay, and the Applicant has a financial assistance policy available to patients who are in need. The NYULH Charity Care and Financial Assistance policy can be found online (https://nyulangone.org/files/charity care financial assistance.pdf). In addition, the Applicant offers charity care, which covered approximately $93 million in care in FY23. (In the same time period, there was another $1.3 billion gap between the cost of care for patients who are covered by government insurance programs and the reimbursement NYULH received for that care in FY23.) How the project will affect obligations NYULH’s obligations under Public Health Law § 2807 k (General Hospital Indigent Care Pool) and federal regulations will not be affected by the implementation of this project. Community services N/A. The project will not be changing the Applicant’s obligations. Medicaid or uninsured discharges/people served/residents NYULH is projecting that approximately of encounters at the new site will be from Medicaid patients in year one. (Total payor mix includes Medicare, Commercial, Medicaid, and all other.) According to SPARCs market data, at the Westchester County level for ambulatory surgery patients for musculoskeletal surgery, the payer mix in 2022 was 31. public health insurance coverage (22. September 2024 8 Medicare alone or in combination and 9. Medicaid alone or in combination), 40. private health insurance coverage, and 10. uninsured. Medical surgical beds/people served/residents N/A. The project does not involve inpatient beds. 9. Project’s impact on staffing: Are there any physician and professional staffing issues related to the project or any anticipated staffing issues that might result from implementation of project? If yes, please describe. No negative impacts are expected. Patients will schedule the same way they do currently and will be seen by the same surgeons and the same department but closer to home. The Applicant’s Schedule 13 notes an increase in FTEs from 47.0 to 65.0 between the first and third year of operation after opening. The Applicant confirmed it will use the same tactics it uses to staff other Ambulatory Surgery sites. The Applicant has standard processes related to staffing, including analyzing volume trends and regularly assessing staffing needs based on patient volume, care models, and service demands. The Applicant also deploys recruitment and retention strategies such as those related to salaries and professional development to attract and retain staff. 10. Civil rights access complaints: Are there any civil rights access complaints against the Applicant? If yes, please describe. • 6 total complaints filed with the NYC Commission on Human Rights o 1 race discrimination complaint was investigated and dismissed o 1 race discrimination complaint was closed for administrative cause o 1 gender discrimination complaint is in settlement discussions o 3 are pending open investigation: ▪ 1 related to disability access ▪ 2 related to gender discrimination • 11 total complaints filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights o 9 have been dismissed ▪ 5 related to disability discrimination ▪ 1 related to national origin discrimination ▪ 2 related to discrimination of national origin, race, color ▪ 1 related to discrimination of national origin, race, color, and marital status o 1 national origin discrimination complaint is pending an open investigation September 2024 9 o 1 related to discrimination on the basis of disability, military status, national origin, domestic violence victim status, relationship or association, and opposed discrimination/retaliation is pending an open investigation. 11. Similar projects/work in the last five years: Has the Applicant undertaken similar projects/work in the last five years? If yes, describe the outcomes and how medically underserved group(s) were impacted as a result of the project. Explain why the applicant requires another investment in a similar project after recent investments in the past. The NYULH Orthopedics department has not made an investment of this nature (i.e., an Ambulatory Surgery Center) in Westchester County in the past. The Department has undertaken other multi specialty Ambulatory Surgical Centers in Manhattan (333 East 38th Street and 171 Delancey Street) and Patchogue, Suffolk County (196 Main Street). This project in Westchester is similar in the type of building being constructed but is in a different service area, serving a different patient population. STEP 2 POTENTIAL IMPACTS 1. Intended impacts on health care access, health equity, and health disparities: For each medically underserved group identified in Step 1 Question 2, describe how the project will: a) Improve access to services and health care; b) Improve health equity; and c) Reduce health disparities Since orthopedic services cut across all patient groups, there will be a positive impact on each medically underserved group identified in Step 1, Question 2 with some additional benefits for some groups. The primary benefit will be improved access to local orthopedic services for patients residing in Westchester as well as some patients outside the service area. Because they will be able to access services closer to their homes, it removes the burden of having to travel to Manhattan and the time and costs associated with that travel. This will especially improve access and health equity for medically underserved groups who experience the greatest burden, namely low income people who will not have to risk losing income due to missed work and travel costs, people with disabilities or limited mobility and older adults for whom any travel and accessing care in Manhattan can be difficult, people living rural areas who have limited or no local services available and would also have to incur travel costs to Manhattan, and racial and ethnic minorities and women in the service area, who have comprised a significant portion of previous patients, and will also benefit from having access to orthopedic services closer to home. The project may reduce health disparities if all patients, including those most burdened by the current state, are able to access and receive more of the recommended care and services. September 2024 10 2. Unintended impacts: For each medically underserved group identified in Step 1 Question 2, describe any unintended positive and/or negative impacts to health equity that might occur as a result of the project. The Independent Entity does not anticipate any unintended negative impacts to health equity expected as a result of the project. There are the intended positive impacts described in response to Question 2.1.b and 2.1.c, In addition to the impacts already stated, the Applicant expects the project and the more accessible space to solve some of the access issues they heard from patients who use wheelchairs. 3. Indigent care: How will the amount of indigent care, both free and below cost, change (if at all) if the project is implemented? Include the current amount of indigent care, both free and below cost, provided by the Applicant. The new site in Westchester is designed to enhance accessibility while maintaining service levels. Upon reviewing the Applicant’s projected budget and operational forecasts, it is anticipated that the amount of indigent care currently provided by the Applicant will not change. The Applicant covered approximately $93 million in charity care in FY23. 4. Access by transportation: Describe the access by public or private transportation, including Applicant sponsored transportation services, to the Applicant's service(s) or care if the project is implemented. Currently, NYULH patients travelling for orthopedic care reside in Westchester as well as some patients outside the service area travel by either public or private transportation. The new facility located in Westchester County will bring care closer to their homes. Patients using private transportation are accompanied by family members and other caretakers. For these patients, the facility will offer valet parking at the main entrance. Some patients may take public transportation such as subway, bus, and train. Access to those forms of transportation depends on where the patient lives. The site location is nearby a variety of public transit stops that allow for accessible access for patients travelling to the center via public transit. Bee Line Bus 82 (Loop B) stops right in front of the site. Additionally, Bee Line Bus 3, 12, 13, and 62 stop at the intersection of Westchester Avenue and Gannet Drive, which is 0.2 miles from the site. The Applicant also has a process for patients who need to get to and from their appointments but are unable to cover the cost. In these cases, the hospital organizes and supports the cost of transportation to ensure they can access their care in a safe and timely manner. This is available to patients who express a need, regardless of their income status. September 2024 11 5. Architectural barriers for people with mobility impairments: Describe the extent to which implementation of the project will reduce architectural barriers for people with mobility impairments. This project will make it easier for patients with mobility impairments to access care since the location will be closer to their homes, and they will not have to travel into a Manhattan and manage uneven sidewalks and curbs, which are difficult to navigate with wheelchairs, walkers, etc. The facility will have handicap parking and ramps built to ADA compliance and building codes. 6. Reproductive health services and maternal health care N/A due to orthopedic focus of the project. MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT 7. List of local health department(s) Westchester County Department of Health 8. Did the local health department(s) provide information for, or partner with, the Independent Entity for the HEIA of this project? The Independent Entity conducted an interview about the potential impact of this project with Dr. Sherlita Amler, Commissioner of Health for the Westchester County Department of Health. Dr. Amler indicated that an ambulatory surgery center would be welcomed medical care in Westchester County and particularly in White Plains, as its central location will broaden access for county residents to have surgical procedures closer to home. She also noted that the location ensured that if a patient needed a hospital admission, they would not have to travel a long distance to receive care. Dr. Amler highlighted that Westchester County’s large population of older adults would benefit from this facility. She noted that there are several retirement communities in Westchester and residents of those communities, as well as older individuals throughout the county in general, would now be able to receive these services without having to go into Manhattan, which she saw as a real benefit. She also stressed that not having to travel long distances is important for people who face challenges with transportation in the county, including people who do not have a car. Dr. Amler noted that Westchester County is currently, and has since COVID, been experiencing long delays in residents getting access to primary care appointments. She underscored throughout the interview that this may be a barrier for individuals having access to the ambulatory surgery center. Without a primary care provider to make a referral for an appointment with a specialist, such as an orthopedist, she expressed concern with how patients will have access to it. From an equity perspective, she said this particularly would be a barrier for newly arrived immigrants and non English September 2024 12 speakers. She also highlighted this issue for individuals with mobility issues and people who are homebound, noting the barriers they face to getting specialist referrals from primary care doctors for orthopedic services. Finally, Dr. Amler expressed concern about access to the facility for low income individuals and people without insurance. She perceives that the county’s Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHCs) are overwhelmed, and thus the low income individuals who rely on these sites for healthcare are not necessarily getting in for primary care and thereby referred to needed orthopedic care. Similarly, uninsured individuals may not get appointments with primary care physicians because of their lack of insurance and thus would present a barrier for referrals. Dr. Amler’s verbatim statement can be found in the Meaningful Engagement tab of the HEIA Data Table. 9. Meaningful engagement of stakeholders Please see attached the completed “Meaningful Engagement” table in the HEIA Data Tables template provided with this assessment. 10. Most affected community members: Based on your findings and expertise, which stakeholders are most affected by the project? Has any group(s) representing these stakeholders expressed concern the project or offered relevant input? The stakeholder interviews revealed multiple overall benefits of the orthopedic ambulatory services being expanded to Westchester. These benefits include reduced travel time because of access to local services; easier access to surgery in terms of parking and building access; and reduced or eliminated costs in travel fees, such as gas, parking fees, and toll fees. While this applies to all patient populations, including the racial and ethnic minorities and women who, similar to previous years, are expected to comprise a significant portion of the patient population, feedback from our meaningful engagement showed a significant impact on the following medically underserved groups: • Older adults • People with disabilities, particularly with mobility issues (e.g., in need of hip or knee replacement) • Low income people • Persons living in rural areas Stakeholders expressed a desire to have imaging and testing services (e.g., MRI, X ray, etc.) and rehabilitation services all onsite at the proposed ambulatory surgery center. This would further alleviate travel and cost burden for orthopedic patients and allow for more continuity of care for patients throughout their pre op, surgery, and follow up experiences. September 2024 13 The Applicant verified that patients at the new location will not have to travel to Manhattan to get any pre or post op and imaging done. Any X rays and lab work needed by patients who will undergo surgery at the new location will be able to get that done onsite. For routine work, there are also imaging, lab and therapy sites under development in Westchester, in addition to the Applicant’s current faculty group practice office in White Plains. The Applicant also plans to have physical therapy in the same building. Other stakeholders emphasized ways to ensure greater access to all patients, especially low income patients and those who receive Medicaid and those who are uninsured, by providing supportive services, partnering with providers who serve medically underserved groups, having accessible hours, and making financing options available. 11. Results of engaging community members: How has the Independent Entity’s engagement of community members informed the Health Equity Impact Assessment about who will benefit as well as who will be burdened from the project? As part of our meaningful engagement of stakeholders, we spoke with 12 stakeholders about the project. We conducted 8 patient interviews, 1 interview with the Director of Care Management and Social Work for Orthopedic Surgery at NYU Langone, 1 interview with a local community based organization, 1 interview with a local health department official, and 1 interview with a local FQHC primary care physician. The stakeholders we spoke to included 3 members of a racial or ethnic minority group, 4 individuals aged 65 or over, 1 person living with a disability, and 2 people living in rural areas. All Patients The stakeholder interviews enabled us to identify perceived benefits of the proposed orthopedic ambulatory services in Westchester. One main benefit will be localized care within one location, such as testing services before and after a surgery. One patient explained how she had to travel 1.5 hours to Manhattan for a 4 minute test, which can be cost prohibitive and impractical for many people. She discussed: “I went down [to Manhattan] for a 4 minute test and it cost me like $22, and that’s obviously with no parking. It’s all parking lots in Manhattan…It’s scary for a lot of people. I’m a city girl, so it doesn’t bother me, but it’s very expensive no matter what you do. It’s just expensive to just park. But if you do anything in White Plains, there’s a lot of parking lots, you know, open parking lots. It’s just so much more easier to park and free pretty much.” (Patient 1). September 2024 14 The community based representative also discussed how the new location will also be a benefit for all residents in the area. “I’ve worked in senior living within Westchester, so I know even not just [elder care facility]. But other facilities will appreciate having this facility in Westchester… I think not only just for seniors, but just for the general community. It would be beneficial, because a lot of people are moving from New York City to Westchester…having that connection within New York City hospital, a New York City big name hospital. Then it's gonna it will be beneficial to the community.” (Community based Representative). Ultimately, having an orthopedic ambulatory surgery center in White Plains makes access to services easier for all populations in Westchester County or closer to the Westchester area. One patient summarized it as removing barriers to care: “It would be an easier way to use more doctors and to get the closer to home service…Thoughts on having the ambulatory service in White Plains is gonna be a plus for everyone coming north, coming South, East, West, it'll take the burden and the fare of people going into the city to be in White Plains. It's more relaxed and the same service that we're gonna have, I think it's a plus all around for everything, anything you're gonna do. White Plains is definitely a place to be in.” (Patient 1). Another patient captured the overall positive response to the idea of having these services locally when they said: “I think that’s great. Instead of making a trip to the city which would take up towards an hour, hour and a half to get there, being so close where I live, I think it’s great.” (Patient 3). As stated, other patients expressed a desire to have all the services they need at the new location, including imaging, testing, and rehabilitation. “I think it’s a good idea, but as I said, then you can’t complete the deal in White Plains, it’s not worth it.” (Patient 6) A local FQHC primary care physician also mentioned that there is a need for sports medicine in the area. Older Adults As reflected in the oversampling of older adults in our community engagement, orthopedic services often serve greater numbers of older adults, especially for hip and knee replacements. The location of the proposed orthopedic ambulatory services in Westchester has a large community of residential and elder care homes in the area. September 2024 15 The older adult population in the area is growing as the cost of living in Manhattan is growing. A community based organizational representative of an elder care home explained: “People are moving into the area because the cost of NYC. There are new buildings in Westchester, White Plains, and New Rochelle as people are not wanting the hustle and bustle of NYC but still want the same access to the same care.” (Community Based Representative). Opening an ambulatory surgery center in this location will help meet the orthopedic needs of this growing older population in Westchester County, making it easier for them to receive services closer to home and avoid the “stress and chaos,” as described by one patient about traveling to Manhattan for surgery. People with Disabilities Generally orthopedic patients have functional limitations, especially patients needing hip or knee replacements. Getting to the Manhattan site with mobility issues becomes more prohibitive, as there is no area to pull up to the entrance with a car or valet parking services to ease getting into the building. One patient explained: “It’s easier again, people with disabilities to get to, in my opinion, places in Westchester than it is to New York City. If I’m in New York City, I’m going to go to a hospital in New York City. If I’m in Westchester, I much prefer a facility here in Westchester.” (Patient 2). The Westchester location would have availability for patients to pull up to the building for drop off, easing the stress and logistics of navigating getting to their appointments while struggling with mobility issues. Another patient discussed the burden of going to Manhattan from a caregiver’s perspective. This required extra time and cost, as she was unable to drive herself given the need for a new hip. The patient said: “My wife had a hip replacement at NY Langone going into the city. I mean, going down there at 6 am in the morning, staying there the whole day, and then she was released at 3 o’clock in the afternoon…so definitely [positive] in terms of not having to commute in traffic…pay for parking, for tolls.” (Patient 3). The Director of Social Work stressed the need to assess patients’ living situation and supports at home when considering the functionality of individuals with disabilities or mobility issues related to their orthopedic surgery who will be going home after their procedure in an ambulatory setting like the one proposed. As she highlighted, anyone going to ambulatory surgery will need a support person for transportation to and from the site and will need a stable place to recover with someone able to help them with September 2024 16 daily functioning post surgery. She highlighted the importance of the care team assessing patients’ current living situations and what kind of help they may need at home following their procedure. The Applicant verified the process that they use to assess needs and ensure support. For example, patients having elective joint replacement surgery receive a phone call from a nurse clinical care coordinator (CCC) in advance of their surgery. In that call, an assessment is completed to determine the patient’s home situation, available caregiving supports, and any needs for resources in anticipation of a discharge home following surgery. These questions specifically assess a patient’s current functioning and needs for support in their activities of daily living as well as any assistive devices needed. The nurse CCC also provides education about what to expect post surgery, including length of stay in the hospital, medications, homecare, and other topics related to discharge planning. Referrals to homecare services are made based on patient choice and in advance of surgery. Low Income People Although none of the stakeholders identified as low income, all the patients expressed concerns about the current cost of getting to NYU Langone in Manhattan and how these costs become more prohibitive for low income populations. One patient discussed how the new ambulatory service needs to have access to a bus line, which is available at the new proposed location. The patient said: “They’d [NYU Langone] have to look at the bus lines because people of low income aren’t going to take Ubers or cabs. There has to be a bus line or something if you’re looking at the access for low income patients.” (Patient 4). The patient also acknowledged that low income patients would have limited means to get to Manhattan for orthopedic services, but the Westchester location would provide more access to care: “People who were low income probably wouldn’t go into the city because of transportation costs would be too great and they’re not taking public transportation because they’re having surgery. So, I think it makes it easier for the low income patients.” (Patient 4). Another patient confirmed the need for localized services for patients who are low income and who have disabilities. They explained: “It would draw them there initially, but if what they need done and have to find out they have to go in the city, it is for naught. They went there because they can’t go in the city. If disabled or too poor, would be drawn there to use the services, but find out what they can’t be done…so then what happens.” (Patient 6). September 2024 17 Highlighting both the convenience the proposed location would offer for drop off at the entrance and the reduction in cost of transport to the city, one patient said: “Somebody is driving, and you pull up, drop off, and keep going and try to find parking. So there’s no valet parking for either one of those hospitals that I’ve gone to…There’s no pay for parking here [Westchester] next to the office. Literally in New York City, it costs me probably $35, $40 to park every time or I take a limo that costs me $150.” (Patient 2). The Director of Social Work also highlighted that transportation would need to be discussed with patients so they are not stuck with a cost. Finally, an FQHC primary care physician discussed the importance of access and hours for patients that are low income or housing insecure: “For patients that work and can’t take off work, the hours can be problematic if there are no evening hours or Saturdays hours for those that work and don’t have paid time off, that could be a challenge...again, sometimes for our patients that are homeless or unstably housed, their ability to get to and have transportation issues. Their ability to get to the appointment sometimes is a barrier.” (PrimaryCare Physician). The Applicant verified multiple mechanisms to assist patients who need transportation support and/or who cannot afford it. These include staff access to an online portal to arrange for transportation for patients who have Medicaid, care management staff support, information about medical escort services and transportation options, and charitable funds. Persons Living in Rural Areas One patient, who identified as living in a rural area, spoke specifically about the need to have access to these services closer to home. They said: “Where I come from, there's limited resources… but dealing with NYU has been a very good experience…The quality of the doctors as far as the care that I received if, they can duplicate that in White Plains, it's a home run.” (Patient 8). 12. Relevant community members that did not participate: Did any relevant stakeholders, especially those considered medically underserved, not participate in the meaningful engagement portion of the Health Equity Impact Assessment? If so, list. People who are eligible for or receive public health benefits and who do not have third party health coverage or have inadequate third party health coverage September 2024 18 Although we did not talk with any Medicaid, uninsured, or underinsured patients and the payor mix is expected to remain the same, these medically underserved groups may be impacted. An FQHC primary care provider mentioned that her patients’ insurance status is a barrier for accessing orthopedic surgeries. She suggested that the newly proposed orthopedic ambulatory center should take multiple insurances. Specifically, she discussed: “I think if it [new orthopedic ambulatory center] takes a wide variety of insurances, and if it takes the Medicaid managed care plans, it will be an added resources, so that is a good thing.” (Primary Care Physician). The following medically underserved groups did not participate in the meaningful engagement portion of the HEIA: • Low income people • Immigrant • Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other than cisgender people • People who do not have third party health coverage or have inadequate third party health coverage • People who are eligible for or receive Medicaid coverage STEP 3 MITIGATION 1. Effective communication of services or care (language access): If the project is implemented, how does the Applicant plan to foster effective communication about the resulting impact(s) to service or care availability to the following: a) People of limited English speaking ability b) People with speech, hearing, or visual impairments c) If the applicant does not have plans to foster effective communication, what does the Independent Entity advise? Information provided by the Applicant indicates that they will communicate its services and care options to the patients and community using a standard, multi pronged advertising/communication plan. For individuals of limited English speaking ability, the Applicant has the ability to translate relevant materials as needed such as marketing flyers, press releases, and in facility signage. There will be a targeted marketing campaign in Westchester County announcing the opening of the facility and services offered. A letter will be sent to existing patients notifying of the opening. Clinic staff—both surgeons and front desk staff—will also be communicating the details of this new facility at patient appointments well before it takes effect. Current clinic staff will also alert patients as they call for appointments and when they are at their appointments in the current clinic prior to the opening. September 2024 19 The Applicant advertising/communication plan will also include outreach to specific print publications in Westchester County, such as the Journal News, Yorktown PennySaver, and Examiner Media. The Applicant will update their website with information about the new facility and post on social media as well. (Note that these are mainly in English.) Regarding individuals who have speech, hearing, or visual impairments, the Applicant uses digital best practices for accessibility that are informed by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2, the industry standard to ensure users with disabilities (such as vision, cognitive/learning, and/or motor disabilities) can access content equitably. This approach includes providing alternative text for images, captions for videos, and ensuring that all digital content is navigable via keyboard for those who cannot use a mouse. 2. Suggested project changes to better meet medically underserved group needs: What specific changes are suggested so the project better meets the needs of each medically underserved group (identified above)? The Independent Entity and stakeholders had the following suggestions for how the project can meet their needs as they considered the impact of the project: Ensuring access through referral partnerships There was a concern that county residents of some underserved groups will face a critical barrier to accessing care at this site due to the challenge of getting a primary care appointment from which they could be referred for orthopedic services. Both the Health Commissioner and the NYU Langone’s Director of Social Work spoke about the importance of establishing relationships with FQHCs near the proposed ambulatory service center to try to provide better access to underserved populations given FQHC’s role in serving these populations. There are three FQHCs operating multiple locations in Westchester County: Open Door Family Medical Centers, Sun River Health, and Westchester Community Health Centers. The Independent Entity interviewed a physician from Sun River Health who indicated that they have existing capacity for primary care appointments and a willingness to refer patients for services at the new site. The Applicant can leverage their peri operative surgical home (POSH) Coordinator, who has established relationships with various NYU providers to ensure that patients receive appointments for specialist care, including assisting with needed clearance before surgery. Communicating and assisting with supportive services and financing options Stakeholders expressed the need for access to supportive services leading up to and following their surgeries, such as those related to transportation needs. One stakeholder also identified the need for low income people to have financing options, which the September 2024 20 Applicant currently provides. The Applicant should broadly communicate the availability of those services and supports to potential and existing patients and ensure that staff are able to use existing mechanisms to assist patients and their caregivers. One stakeholder also suggested developing partnerships with local pharmacies and car services. Communicate existing imaging, testing, and rehabilitation services at the location and develop additional resources onsite or in the area Some patients described having to travel long distances to Manhattan to complete testing either before or after orthopedic surgery and expressed a desire to have everything they need for pre operation and follow up appointments onsite. This will help alleviate barriers associated with the time, cost, and difficulty of travel. The Applicants indicated that, although they are not Article 28 services and not in scope for this Certificate of Need, they have plans for physical therapy and some imaging services in the same building. They also have plans for additional imaging sites in Westchester County in development. As these services become available, they should communicate about them to all existing patients, to referral partners, and through other marketing and communication methods. For any services they will not provide, they should coordinate access to other local services. Engaging community members on project changes: How can the Applicant engage and consult impacted stakeholders on forthcoming changes to the project? The Independent Entity recommends the Applicant conduct periodic surveys (at least 6 months and 9 months after the opening of the location) with existing patients receive services at the new Westchester location. This will enable the Applicant to assess the impact of the project and make improvements. The Independent Entity recommends that the Applicant emphasize survey outreach to medically underserved groups who were not included in this assessment and conduct interviews to capture nuanced perspectives of the impact of the project. The Independent Entity also proposes interviewing referral partners to assess the ease at which they are able to refer patients, have them seen in a timely fashion, and get their orthopedic needs met. 3. Addressing systemic barriers to equitable access: How does the project address systemic barriers to equitable access to services or care? If it does not, how can the project be modified? This project addresses systemic barriers to equitable access to care by providing services locally, which will increase access to orthopedic care for some patients that September 2024 21 would not otherwise be able to access it at all or without significant burdens. As a location close to their home, the Westchester location would eliminate or reduce some transportation costs (e.g., gas, tolls, parking, etc.) for patients. STEP 4 MONITORING 1. Existing mechanisms and measures to monitor impacts: What are existing mechanisms and measures the Applicant already has in place that can be leveraged to monitor the potential impacts of the project? At the enterprise level, NYU’s Institute for Excellence in Health Equity develops, implements, and disseminates evidence based solutions to advance health equity in clinical care, medical education, and research. The Applicant has developed a health equity impact dashboard and has increased efforts to collect self reported data related to patient demographics in the electronic medical record to facilitate efforts to track the impact of different projects on medically underserved groups. The dashboard specifically includes the Orthopedics department and captures data on all patients, including indicators such as race, ethnic background, gender/gender identity, age group, preferred language, financial class grouping, insurance grouping, median household income, and others. NYULH plans to leverage this dashboard and data, as it does throughout its various projects, to reveal and address inequities and disparities. The Department of Orthopedic Surgery at NYULH captures and measures a variety of outcome measures that can be analyzed by various demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, payer, and primary language. The Applicant is able to identify health disparities in outcome metrics such as orthopedics mortality rate, mortality events, 30 day readmissions, and observed to expected length of stay. Specifically, the Department of Orthopedic Surgery focuses on mortality, length of stay, readmissions, and discharge to home measures in orthopedic procedures such as knee replacement, hip replacement, hip fracture, and spinal fusion. Additionally, the Department of Orthopedic Surgery keeps track of outcomes and metrics related to external organizations such as U.S. News and World Report, CMS, and Leapfrog. To oversee departmental initiatives aimed at reducing health disparities and increasing health equity, the department appointed a Vice Chair of Equity and Inclusion in the Department of Orthopedics. 2. Potential mechanisms and measures Applicant can put in place to monitor impacts: What new mechanisms or measures can be created or put in place by the Applicant to ensure that the Applicant addresses the findings of the HEIA? New mechanisms the Applicant might consider implementing include requiring health equity training for staff and adding questions related to health equity to consumer satisfaction surveys. Using the definitions provided by the State, the Applicant can rework their internal dashboards to report changes in metrics for the specific medically September 2024 22 underserved groups identified to better align with the way other organizations and the State are measuring and monitoring outcomes. The Applicant may also consider continuously engaging with patients receiving services, referral partners, and community groups to obtain qualitative input about how changes have been received and what improvements could be made. This will help ensure the success of this project and inform future projects of a similar nature. STEP 5 DISSEMINATION The Applicant will publicly post the CON application and the HEIA on its website within one week of acknowledgement by the Department. The Department will also publicly post the CON application and the HEIA through NYSE CON within one week of the filing. OPTIONAL: ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM THE INDEPENDENT ENTITY In 250 words or less, provide any additional points of information the Independent Entity feels is relevant to the proposed project. Add any relevant information that was not asked about in the Template but was found through the development of the Health Equity Impact Assessment.

LhotaWestchester ASCJoseph J. LhotaSep 25, 2024Executive Vice President and Vice Dean, Chief of Staff, ChiefFinancial Officer September 2024 24 Westchester ASC Mitigation Plan Through the implementation of this project, NYULH aims to enhance the patient experience and ensure patients are receiving the superior care that they deserve. While the HEIA highlighted some potential concerns from stakeholders, NYULH would like to reiterate it is very early in the planning process and is able to give all concerns strong consideration. Regarding imaging, testing, and rehab services onsite, the proposed ambulatory surgery center does have plans for some imaging services (X ray) and physical therapy on the third floor of the same building. As these will not be Article 28, they were not in the scope of the HEIA / CON. Additionally, there are plans for additional imaging sites in Westchester County that are under development. There will also be basic testing onsite, as lab work can be sent out from the new ASC location. NYULH is committed to ongoing dialogue with stakeholders and will continue to incorporate feedback throughout the planning and implementation processes. Currently, patients undergoing elective joint replacement surgery are assessed by a nurse clinical care coordinator to determine any support services they may require post procedure, improving recovery outcomes. Furthermore, to better serve medically underserved groups, our perioperative surgical home coordinators and providers intend to establish more relationships with nearby FQHCs in the future. This will help address any gaps in care and provide resources and support to those in need. Although we are still in the early stages of planning, we will constantly assess our operating hours to determine if it is feasible to include evening and weekend hours to ensure greater access and flexibility for patients. Lastly, NYULH offers ample financial resources available for patients should they need financial assistance. (The Independent Entity reviewed NYULH’s Financial Assistance and Charity Care Policy extensively and referenced this in the Health Equity Impact Assessment).


Executive Summary NYU Langone Hospitals is submitting this Full Review Construction Certificate of Need application for the creation of an Ambulatory Surgery Center for orthopedic services in Westchester County at 4 Westchester Park Drive, West Harrison NY 10604. The addition of a freestanding ambulatory surgery center in Westchester County will enable patients who reside in or closer to Westchester to access orthopedic services closer to home. Currently, NYULH patients residing in Westchester and as well as some patients outside the service area must travel to Manhattan for orthopedic services, which creates time and cost burdens for patients. Traveling to and within Manhattan is burdensome for all patients and there are some medically underserved groups who face the greatest burdens from traveling to Manhattan. Once the project is complete, patients will still receive care from their same providers closer to home. The current facility is a multi tenant Business Occupancy building with 5 floors. The new program will be a New Ambulatory Healthcare Occupancy and will be shared on the same floor with another tenant which is a Business Occupancy Daycare. The area where the proposed New Ambulatory Surgery Center is currently unoccupied and demolished. The site has parking surrounding the entire building with an abundance of accessible parking spaces. The project will include an NYULH dedicated waiting room with ADA toilet, pre and post procedure/recovery area which will include 12 universal bays, a multi purpose room that can be used as exam/consult room, 4 operating rooms with a combined sterile/supply core, on site Sterile Processing, and all the required clinical patient and support spaces. The construction of the project will be completed in one phase. Please note that the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY) will conduct the architectural review of this project.

Does this project amend or supersede prior CON approvals or a pending application? No If so, what is the original CON number? Intent/Purpose: The purpose of this project is to provide Ambulatory Surgery services to NYULH patients that live in the Westchester/White Plains/Town of Harrison. These patients typically travel to NYULH in Manhattan to receive Ambulatory Surgical care. Having a location closer to home makes it easier for them to access the New York State Department of Health Schedule 6 Certificate of Need Application DOH 155 B Schedule 6 Page 2 (9/6/2022) medical services they need. Many of the patients being treated in this area are elderly and by providing this care closer to their home, it will allow them to spend less time, money and other burdens to receive care. Ultimately making their quality of life and care better. This project also will allow for more of the population living in the surrounding area, who are not currently patients of NYULH, to have access to quality outpatient surgical services and allow NYULH’s outreach to expand. The proposed project is to turn a portion of the Ground level at 4 Westchester Park Drive into an Ambulatory Surgery Center. The space is currently vacant and demolished. The program will provide an NYULH dedicated waiting room with ADA toilet, 12 universal pre and post procedure/recovery bays, 4 Operating rooms, on site Sterile Processing, and all the required clinical, staff and patient support spaces. The expected construction completion in 2026. Site Location: The project is located at 4 Westchester Park Drive, White Plains NY, 10604 Brief description of current facility, including facility type: The current facility is a multi tenant Business Occupancy building with 5 floors.

Are also used to designate base floodplains of lesser hazards, such as areas protected by levees from 100 year flood, or shallow flooding areas with average depths of less than one foot or drainage areas less than 1 square mile. DOH 155 B Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 5 (Revised 11/2018) C and X Area of minimal flood hazard, usually depicted on FIRMs as above the 500 year flood level. High Risk Areas Yes No Zone Description In communities that participate in the NFIP, mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply to all these zones: A Areas with a annual chance of flooding and a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Because detailed analyses are not performed for such areas; no depths or base flood elevations are shown within these zones. AE The base floodplain where base flood elevations are provided. AE Zones are now used on new format FIRMs instead of A1 A30. A1 30 These are known as numbered A Zones (e.g., A7 or A14). This is the base floodplain where the FIRM shows a BFE (old format). AH Areas with a annual chance of shallow flooding, usually in the form of a pond, with an average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Base flood elevations derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected intervals within these zones. AO River or stream flood hazard areas, and areas with a or greater chance of shallow flooding each year, usually in the form of sheet flow, with an average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Average flood depths derived from detailed analyses are shown within these zones. AR Areas with a temporarily increased flood risk due to the building or restoration of a flood control system (such as a levee or a dam). Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements will apply, but rates will not exceed the rates for unnumbered A zones if the structure is built or restored in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations. A99 Areas with a annual chance of flooding that will be protected by a Federal flood control system where construction has reached specified legal requirements. No depths or base flood elevations are shown within these zones. High Risk Coastal Area Yes No Zone Description In communities that participate in the NFIP, mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply to all these zones: Zone V Coastal areas with a or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated with storm waves. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. No base flood elevations are shown within these zones. VE, V1 30 Coastal areas with a or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated with storm waves. These areas have a chance of flooding over the life of a 30 year mortgage. Base flood elevations derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected intervals within these zones. Undetermined Risk Area Yes No Zone Description DOH 155 B Schedule LRA 4/Schedule 7 6 (Revised 11/2018) D Areas with possible but undetermined flood hazards. No flood hazard analysis has been conducted. Flood insurance rates are commensurate with the uncertainty of the flood risk. 4.2 Are you in a designated evacuation zone? If Yes, the Elevation Certificate (FEMA Flood Insurance) shall be submitted with the application.

They will be able to once again engage in physical activities that they have previously been unable to partake in. 9. Has your organization engaged local community partners in its Prevention Agenda efforts, including the local health department and any local Prevention Agenda coalition? NYU Langone Health reached out to Dr. Sherlita Amler, Commissioner of Health for the Westchester County Department of Health. Dr. Amler indicated that an ambulatory surgery center would be welcomed medical care in Westchester County and particularly in White Plains, as its central location will broaden access for county residents to have surgical procedures closer to home. 10. What data from the Prevention Agenda dashboard and/or other metrics are you using to track progress to advance local Prevention Agenda goals? Dr. Amler highlighted that Westchester County’s large population of older adults would benefit from this facility. She noted that there are several retirement communities in Westchester and residents of those communities, as well as older individuals throughout the county in general, would now be able to receive these services without having to go into Manhattan, which she saw as a real benefit New York State Department of Health Schedule 16B Certificate of Need Application DOH 155 D Schedule 16B 4 (11/2019) 11.

Community Health Needs and Assets Assessment:2021 2022 Hempstead VillageNassau County, Long IslandCommunity Health Needs and Assets Assessment Process A Community Health Needs and Assets Assessment (CHNAA) is a way to understand the healthof a community by reviewing data and information from community members about theirhealth needs and priorities. That data and information can then be used to help shapeprograms to address those concerns and to reduce inequities.NYU Langone Hospital Long Island (formerly known as Winthrop University Hospital andearlier as Nassau Hospital) has served communities across Nassau and Suffolk Counties since1896. Every three years we are required to do a Community Health Needs and AssetsAssessment and develop a plan, called a Community Service Plan, to identify communitypriorities and implement programs to address these needs. Residents from Hempstead (Incorporated Village of Hempstead) utilize services at NYULangone Hospital Long Island. We wanted to better understand how we can best serve theHempstead community as part of our 2022 2024 Community Service Plan.The best way to understand the needs, priorities, and assets of a community is to havecommunity partners and residents help design and implement the process for assessing needsand assets. Beginning in July 2021, local community based organizations and NYULangone faculty and staff held monthly meetings to identify what is known and whatinformation is missing about community health needs, assets, and priorities. The groupreviewed available data, interviewed individual staff and community members, and hostedsix group discussions with thirty seven participants. This report summarizes the findings from the needs and assets assessment. The numbers usedin this report are based on a snapshot from the most recent year of data available. These dataalone cannot explain why these patterns exist or how they are affected by the legacies ofstructural racism and community disinvestment. The numbers alone do not tell the wholestory of the community. Input and insights from talking with community members andcommunity based organizations were key to understanding the strengths and needs inHempstead.Methods Used for Community Health Needs and Assets AssessmentReview public dataLook at data collected bygovernment agencies andorganizations.Share results Review findings withcommunity partners to planfor services to meet needs.Talk with individualsAsk community membersdirectly about theirthoughts.

Some have fled violence and poverty in their home countries.Others followed family members who settled in Hempstead, further strengthening the strong familyties within the community. Many come to Hempstead speaking only Spanish and the lack of bi lingual services and information can be a barrier to accessing care and other needs.

In Hempstead, of highschool students werechronically absent in schoolyear 2020 21, a time whenremote and hybrid learningoptions were in place due tothe COVID pandemic. While educational attainment in part reflects limited educational opportunities available incountries outside the US, for many years high school graduation rates for Hempstead were lowerthan other communities, although gains have been made more recently. COVID 19 furtherdisrupted education for many students. In school year 2020 21, a time of hybrid and remotelearning options, chronic absenteeism was very high in Hempstead. Some attribute the lack ofschool bus transportation to high school as a factor in preventing students from getting to school. Parents in the community spoke about the importance of education for their children. In February2020, New York State assigned a monitor to oversee operations of the Hempstead School District.Private and charter schools in the area are expensive or based on a lottery admission process,further adding stress to parents concerned about how to provide their children with bettereducational opportunities.7Community Snapshot: EconomicIncomeIn Nassau County, of householdsearn $200,000 or more per year.
