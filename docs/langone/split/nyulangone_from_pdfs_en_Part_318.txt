There is such a need for families to provide care or get care for their children, and with the expansion we will be opening up other beds for families to get appropriate care which is needed in New York City.Respondent 0025/28/2024 community leadersyesZoom interviewyesnoN/ARespondent 0035/13/24; 5/29/2024residents of the project’s service areaHad interview scheduled and followed up, but did not show for interviewRespondent 0045/23/2024residents of the project’s service areaZoom interviewyesyesAs a former patient at NYU, and as a member of the Youth Advisory Council, I've been thrilled to see the expansion in the Hassenfeld children's hospital that has been really great for the patients. And with this, I am also excited to see the expansion of the PICU as that will provide a lot of benefits a lot of great new things for patients and their families in these trying times more space. Just more opportunity for good care, and the assurance that the patients get the care they need in tough times.Respondent 0055/24/2024; 5/29/24residents of the project’s service areaDid not respond to outreachRespondent 0065/29/2024 community leadersYesZoom InterviewyesyesI think that the expansion of beds is a good idea if it can allow kids to stay in the PICU a little bit longer if that would stabilize them. I just don't want to see any kids being moved out too soon and have to come back because that is… It's a whole move. It's a whole move on floors. It's a whole move on staffing. It's a lot. And I would say that I'm also in support of the expansion, but only if that means an expansion and staff, because I don't think that Because I think that the nursing team is really cause it's the day to day, minute by minute stuff that helps the family through that they, if anything, expand the nursing. You know you cannot expect those nurses to do more than what they're already doing. They're doing a lot. But yeah, I'm in support of it.Respondent 0075/30/2024residents of the project’s service areaYesZoom InterviewyesyesI believe that increasing beds in the in the pick you only increases the ability to treat more kids. If the staff ratio is the same and allows the hospital to help more people, to me, that's a great thing.”LabelEstimateMargin of ErrorPercentPercent Margin of ErrorEstimateMargin of ErrorPercentPercent
