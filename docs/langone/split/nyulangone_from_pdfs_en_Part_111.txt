A. The Architect and Interior Designer should use this section as a guide for specifying door hardware on NYU Langone capital projects. This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of specifying products that are appropriate and code compliant for specific spaces. The Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other products if they believe those products meet the design intent of the project and this section of the Design Guidelines. B. The architect shall develop a hardware schedule that is code compliant to: NYC Building Code, CMS, Joint Commission, NFPA and all other applicable codes. Locking devices shall not be installed on corridor doors in designated paths of egress or on exit or stair doors, unless approved by EH&S and RED+F Leadership. C. These hardware guidelines are for the main campus at NYU Langone Health. The architect shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with any applicable building codes. In addition:  for the NYU Langone Long Island campus, the architect shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with their standard hardware.  for NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn campuses, the architect shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with their standard hardware. Yale hardware sets shall be used in lieu of Sergeant.  for Off site locations, the architect shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with the building landlord’s hardware requirements. D. The Architect shall follow the Fire Rated Hollow Metal Door Standards by RED+F’s Facilities department. All fire rated doors and frames shall be fully welded. E. It shall be the Architect’s responsibility to coordinate all work with NYU Langone Security, Fire Alarm, and Infant Abduction System (if applicable) Vendors and associated NYU Langone personnel.

The Architect shall include in the specification a paragraph stating that the GC is responsible for setting up a pre installation meeting between the hardware installer, the automatic door vendor and the security vendor to coordinate installation of all trades. H. The Architect shall include in the specification the submission of a Quality Control Plan (QCP) for fire rated doors, frames and hardware to RED+F Commissioning within 30 days of contract award. The QCP shall require that:  NYU Langone engage an independent on site commissioning agent dedicated to the inspection of fire rated doors, frames and hardware.  The inspection will be based on the requirements set forth in the NYC Building Code and NFPA 80 Standards for Fire Doors & Other Opening Protectives. The door, frame and hardware installation shall comply with the requirements set forth in NFPA 80 for all clearance and install requirements and NFPA 101 for inspection of door openings.  The agent shall use an electronic inventory tracking system (EITS) made accessible to RED+F staff and the A/E Team to track inventory and installation/inspection status.  The agent shall inspect each fire rated door, frame and hardware installation for compliance and acceptance and prepare a report at the intervals described below: Stage 1: Inspect the frame installation upon completion of the preliminary bracing of pressed steel frames prior to wall installation. Stage 2: Re inspect the frame installation upon completion of the wall construction by the masonry and drywall trades. Stage 3: Re inspect the assembly upon completion of the hollow metal doors and architectural hardware. Stage 4: Re inspect the assembly upon completion of electrical work including security and fire alarm installation.  The Contractor shall not proceed to the next stage until all deficiencies have been corrected, re inspected and approved.
