Yet despite the increasing median age of the United States population, the workforce of physicians trained in geriatrics is expected to decrease over the next decade. Recognizing this problem, the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone Health is launching an ambulatory consultative clinic to combat the growing shortage of geriatricians. Complementing the work of NYU Langone’s , the new clinic will focus on expanding access to geriatric services for those living in the community. “At our new clinic, the aim is to address complex issues in an approachable, holistic manner.” James M. Lai, MD “Lengthy wait times and delays frustrate patients, their caregivers, and providers,” says , associate director of clinical services for the Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care , and leader of the project. “In addition, a single inpatient admission is rarely sufficient to resolve every issue. At our new clinic, the aim is to approach complex issues in an approachable, holistic manner.” Needs Going Unmet Unmet care needs for older adults include frailty, falls, polypharmacy, cognitive disability, and memory loss. Owing to complexity and time constraints, primary care providers often have difficulty in managing these conditions, leaving patients without proper support. “Reduced access to specialized geriatric care can lead to unwanted health outcomes and increased morbidity,” says Dr. Lai. “Reduced access to specialized geriatric care can lead to unwanted health outcomes and increased morbidity.” Accordingly, a key focus of the new clinic will be comprehensive geriatric assessment, which incorporates prognosis, quality of life, life expectancy, and each patient’s personal values into the decision-making process. “By focusing on the patient’s goals and desires, we can better assess the benefits and risks of interventions, like medications or surgery,” Dr. Lai explains. Moreover, Dr. Lai emphasizes that these assessments do not always lead to the initiation of a new prescription or surgical intervention, but may involve deprescribing or forgoing surgery to avoid postoperative complications. For example, while a surgeon may deem some older patients good candidates for surgery, their cognitive or functional state may preclude them from achieving successful postoperative rehabilitation. Better Outcomes Through Collaboration Concerning access to care, Dr. Lai acknowledges that it remains a problem nationwide. He believes that providing specialized geriatric care in outpatient settings could help to expand access. With the future in mind, Dr. Lai envisions the potential for pioneering and innovative collaborations with NYU Langone’s subspecialist divisions and Through this synergy, he hopes to develop novel outpatient-based rehabilitation protocols for older adults who have cognitive impairment, imbalance, poor vision, urinary incontinence, and swallowing issues. “Possible new partnerships might help to close the knowledge gaps in geriatric rehabilitation,” Dr. Lai says, “and may lead to improvements in healthcare provision for this high-risk population.” James M.

Combining our decades of surgical expertise and leading-edge surgical technologies, we treat patients from around the United States and the globe. A brachial plexus injury is damage to the major nerves that cross the junction between the neck and the arm. These injuries occur most commonly as a result of motor vehicle accidents, but they can also result from other traumas or injuries, such as birth injuries. Mild brachial plexus injuries may heal with time, while more complex injuries may require surgery to avoid loss of movement or function in the shoulder, arm, or hand. We partner with you to ensure the best possible recovery after a brachial plexus injury. Each patient is evaluated by our team of specialists that includes orthopedic surgeons, hand and wrist surgeons, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and neurologists. Our experts tailor an individualized treatment plan for you, which may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, or surgery. If surgery is recommended, recent advances in microsurgical techniques allow our doctors to offer new and effective approaches for brachial plexus injuries. We can perform nerve reconstruction microsurgery to reduce pain and restore sensation and motor movements in the arm, elbow, wrist, and hand. We also perform procedures including tendon and muscle transfers, contracture release, and other reconstruction techniques. Our Therapy Program In many cases, our patients are able to avoid surgery after following our well-designed therapeutic interventions. Our therapy program, which includes experts from , aims to help patients maintain muscle strength and the full range of motion in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand joints. We also prevent muscle loss through electrical stimulation and help ease pain through transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Advanced imaging, occupational therapy rooms, and surgical and recovery facilities are all provided through the Center for Brachial Plexus Injuries. We also offer for those who would prefer not to travel or who would rather receive care in the comfort of their own home. Our surgeons treat brachial plexus injuries in adults and children. Andrew E. Price 877-224-3201 The Center for Ankle Arthritis at is committed to providing a full range of treatment options for people with . Patients can often find pain relief and an improvement in their symptoms with nonsurgical treatments, such as physical therapy, bracing, orthotics, or injections. is needed, our orthopedic foot and ankle surgeons offer cutting-edge reconstructive procedures. If you have mild or moderate arthritis, minimally invasive arthroscopic debridement to remove damaged tissue and cartilage in your ankle may be an option. We were the first hospital in the greater New York area to offer the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement system, or STAR™. This prosthesis may be an option for some people with advanced arthritis to provide both pain relief and preserve motion. Its benefits include quicker recovery time and better long-term success rates than earlier ankle replacement procedures. For those who are not a candidate for ankle replacement, you may consider ankle fusion—in which a surgeon fastens the ends of damaged bones together, so they heal and fuse—as a good option to provide pain relief and increased function. Our team’s extensive experience ensures the best diagnosis and treatment plan for your ankle arthritis. Lew Schon Raymond Walls Mapping the Molecular Mechanisms of Stress & Depression Carla Nasca, PhD. Source: NYU Langone Health Major depressive disorder affects an estimated 21 million adults in the United States every year. While the highly complex mental condition is influenced by the integration of multiple genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and environmental factors, one thing is clear: stress in early life can play a critical role in triggering the disorder. Here, Carla Nasca, PhD , assistant professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience and physiology at NYU Langone Health, discusses her work on mitochondrial mechanisms of epigenetic function for the regulation of brain plasticity in response to stress. The research, she believes, may have identified a new biological marker for depression and, potentially, a much-needed new precision-medicine strategy How does stress change the brain on a structural and molecular level? Dr. Nasca: We know from decades of work that stress can lead to imbalances in neural structures—some serving cognition, decision-making, anxiety, and mood. These alterations to the neural structures are usually adaptive responses, but in some people they lead to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, and they need to be treated. The imbalances, in turn, affect systemic physiology via neural, immunological, and metabolic mediators. In the lab, we discovered a metabolic mediator of this response to stress known as LAC, or acetyl-L-carnitine. LAC is a mitochondrial metabolite, which is best known for its role in fatty acid oxidation. Our lab and work from other groups has shown that LAC also serves as a metabolite that regulates epigenetic function. Why is epigenetic regulation so important? Think of a book. To read the words inside, we need to open the book. Similarly, epigenetic regulation acts as the key that unlocks chromatin structure, allowing DNA to be read and genes to be expressed. “Mitochondria produce a substantial proportion of the cell’s substrate for epigenetic regulation.” Our group and others have shown that mitochondria produce a substantial proportion of the cell’s substrate for epigenetic regulation. This means that there’s integration between the mitochondria and nuclei of a cell to allow epigenetic regulation and the expression of genes that are important for synaptic plasticity. What effect does LAC have in rodent models of stress? We find that administration of LAC in rodents leads to adaptive responses to stress. When we boost certain mitochondrial pathways in rodent models, we boost the ability of cells to produce LAC, and we see a corresponding change in epigenetic regulation that ameliorates the response to stress. When the pathway is suppressed and cells produce less LAC, there are maladaptive responses to stress. In animals, we can observe these changes at the level of dendrites, key structures of neurons that allow for cell-to-cell communication. We find that in rodent models of chronic, prolonged stress, dendrites in the hippocampus as well as other areas of the brain are shorter as compared to mice that did not experience stress. We can ameliorate these changes in dendritic plasticity, what we call structural plasticity, by administering LAC. An illustration of a neuron. Source: Getty Images In our rodent models of chronic stress, we also observe that the animals start with lower levels of LAC than control mice. When we administer LAC to fill this gap, they showed a rapid antidepressant response, which takes only 3 days to occur, versus other drugs that require 14 days to show an antidepressant response. How might your results inform clinical practice? We’ve started translating these findings to humans and are seeing similar relationships between LAC levels, stress, and depression as to what we’ve observed in rodents. In many of our papers and unpublished work, we find that childhood trauma, in the form of emotional neglect and emotional abuse, is linked to aberrant mitochondrial metabolism. Indeed, people with major depressive disorder who also report the highest levels of childhood trauma—life stress events in childhood—have the lowest levels of LAC . Their levels are much lower than in control subjects. “People with major depressive disorder who also report the highest levels of childhood trauma have the lowest levels of LAC.” Another important finding is that these same individuals with the lowest levels of LAC had a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression. This was important to us because it suggested that LAC could be an effective antidepressant by itself and also when co-administered with other drugs to potentially give patients the capacity to respond to other antidepressant medications. But we need to conduct additional studies in humans to better understand the molecular mechanisms of this signaling pathway before patients take any LAC. We replicated our initial finding, that antidepressant nonresponders had the lowest LAC levels, in two cohorts. Now there are multiple papers from other investigators showing the deficiency of LAC as a potential biomarker for depression. So, you’re moving toward a potential clinical trial? Yes, absolutely. The direction we’re moving toward is precision medicine. We want to define and characterize the phenotype of treatment-resistant depression genetically, epigenetically, and metabolically, and look to see if patients respond to LAC alone or as a supplementation strategy. Depression is such a complex phenomenon; can you speak to the need to integrate multiple factors to better understand how patients vary in their response to antidepressants? That’s the spirit of precision medicine. The integration of multiple biological pathways can be an opportunity for us to better define and better characterize the various ways in which major depressive disorder can present. It will not be LAC alone that cures depression. But if we can identify additional biological factors beyond LAC that are involved in this signaling from mitochondria to cell nuclei and in the regulation of genes important for brain plasticity, we can characterize those people who will benefit from targeted treatments.

Top Honors Awarded to Cardiovascular Researcher for Work on Inflammation Kathryn J. Moore, PhD, receiving the Grand Prix scientifique from the Institute de France. Source: NYU Langone Health This past June, the Institut de France co-awarded its Grand Prize in Science (Grand Prix scientifique) to Kathryn J. Moore, PhD , director of NYU Langone Health’s Cardiovascular Research Center . The award—the largest of its kind in cardiovascular research—honored Dr. Moore for her pioneering research on how the innate immune system recognizes excess cholesterol in the body and responds by inducing the chronic inflammation that drives atherosclerosis. Here, Dr. Moore reflects on the prestigious prize, her groundbreaking discoveries that led to it, and what excites her about the future of cardiovascular research. Dr. Moore, what have you learned about how macrophages can trigger the kind of chronic inflammation that drives atherosclerosis? Dr. Moore: In atherosclerosis, macrophages enter the artery wall to clear low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that accumulate due to hypercholesterolemia. But once the macrophages ingest the LDL, they can become overloaded with cholesterol and trapped in the vessel wall—a good deed gone bad. The accumulating macrophages call in more immune cells to help resolve the issue, but this backfires, forming chronic inflammation. It’s that chronic, low-grade inflammation that drives plaque formation in the arteries over decades, leading to atherosclerosis. “Once the macrophages ingest the LDL, they can become overloaded with cholesterol and trapped in the vessel wall—a good deed gone bad.” My work focuses on trying to understand what makes beneficial inflammation turn chronic, what the key pathways are, and whether we can reverse them. The Grand Prix scientifique was awarded specifically for my discovery of how macrophages recognize LDL , which is by using the same receptors designed to detect and defend against pathogens. By engaging these defense receptors, LDL triggers the production of potent pro-inflammatory molecules and inflammation. What about your work on RNA molecules—how are they involved in cholesterol metabolism and inflammation? My lab discovered that microRNAs can repress the expression of genes required for the macrophage to rid itself of the excess cholesterol. By targeting these microRNAs, we enhanced cholesterol efflux from the macrophages, which allowed the cells to leave the artery wall and reduced inflammation in the plaque. Illustration of microRNA. Source: Getty Images I’m also really interested in long non-coding RNAs , many of which are not conserved between humans and preclinical animal models. For years, drug development was based on studies in animal models. But when the drugs were tested in humans, researchers found different results or they didn’t pan out. Understanding that there can be a layer of transcriptional control or genome organization in humans that is not conserved in other animals can offer tremendous insights. For the last 10 years, my lab has been studying how these human-specific long non-coding RNAs regulate biological processes, whether it’s cholesterol metabolism or inflammation in atherosclerosis. What are you most excited about in inflammation-related research, and what do you want to tackle next? Over the past five years, we’ve seen a revolution in the technologies available to us for research. We are now able to look at tissues at the single-cell level and use techniques like spatial transcriptomics to map cellular gene expression within tissue. It’s giving us unprecedented insight into the complexity of the tissues and the interactions between different cell types within them. For our work on inflammation in the plaque, we are using these technologies to interrogate unique cell types to understand the ones that contribute to plaque progression versus those types that contribute to regression. We want to know how cells are communicating in these different states, and we’re looking at gene expression profiles between the cells to understand what that communication might look like. What do you see as the next challenge to further improving treatments for cardiovascular disease? Lipid-lowering therapies have been highly successful at reducing cardiovascular risk, but many patients still go on to have a heart attack. Even people whose LDL has been lowered very dramatically continue to be at risk of having a cardiac event. “We need complementary therapies to lipid-lowering, and targeting inflammation in the plaque is one area that’s thought to hold promise.” Because of this, we need complementary therapies to lipid-lowering, and targeting inflammation in the plaque is one area that’s thought to hold promise. We seek to develop novel therapies that can convert chronic inflammation into self-resolving inflammation by targeting pathways that hinder its resolution. Finally, what does it mean for you to earn this prestigious award? It’s a tremendous honor to receive this prize, which celebrates the outstanding contributions to cardiovascular research that have been made by luminaries in my field. I have truly flourished in the collaborative and supportive environment at NYU Langone. It has taken my science to a different level. I’ve also been very lucky to work with many talented postdocs and graduate students. Really, this award recognizes the entire lab, past and present. I would not have made these discoveries without my incredible team. Cardiology, Cell Biology Kathryn J. Moore, PhD, is Jean and David Blechman Professor of Cardiology and a professor of cell biology.

AI-Generated Responses to Patient Questions on Thyroid Disease Are Accurate & Empathetic LLMs could be used to help clinicians respond to patient messages, potentially reducing workload. In a pilot study, one of the first of its kind to evaluate LLM performance in thyroid disease, LLM responses to patient questions were more accurate, complete, empathetic, and consistent than online physician responses. In order to reach clinical care, clinicians would be expected to review responses before they reach patients to reduce the risk of the LLM providing inaccurate information. Burnout among physicians is being fueled partly by patient electronic messaging. Recognizing this problem, a team of experts from NYU Langone Health came together to study whether large language models (LLMs), powered by artificial intelligence (AI), could be used to assist in responding to patient questions and reduce the clinician workload—focusing specifically on thyroid disease. At the 2024 American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) meeting, Kepal N. Patel, MD , presented data supporting this idea. Not only were LLM responses to patient questions about thyroid disease accurate, they were more accurate, complete, empathetic, and consistent than physician responses. “After ten hours of surgery, the last thing I want is to have to manually respond to 35 electronic messages.” “After ten hours of surgery, the last thing I want is to have to manually respond to 35 electronic messages,” says Dr. Patel, chief of the Division of Endocrine Surgery at NYU Langone. “As a busy surgeon, my goal is to be efficient with my administrative workload so I can focus on my patients and provide the best care.” Endocrine surgery fellow Rajam Raghunathan, MD, served as lead author on the study and was awarded the Jon Van Heerden Award for Best Paper at the 2024 AAES meeting. The study is one of the first to evaluate LLM responses in thyroid disease. Testing the LLMs The study involved randomly selecting 33 patient questions about thyroid cancer or thyroid disease from the Reddit website’s AskDocs section, an online health community where users can post questions about personal medical conditions and receive answers from verified physicians. The researchers then tested the ability of two different LLMs, ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to respond to these questions, comparing the LLM-generated responses with the verified physician responses from AskDocs. All responses were anonymized and scored for accuracy, quality, and empathy using a four-point Likert scale by seven blinded providers. Of the selected questions, 39 percent focused on thyroid nodules, 30 percent concerned thyroid cancer or cancer worry, 24 percent addressed hypo/hyperthyroidism or goiter concerns, and 6 percent involved postoperative complications related to thyroid surgery. Analyzing the Responses The team highlighted that when interpreting differences in quality ratings, the overall organization of the response must be considered, explaining that LLM responses often include a summary with bullet points, addressing the concerns raised by the patient, then structuring a response thereafter. In a sample electronic exchange about a high-risk TR5 thyroid nodule found on an ultrasound, a patient inquired about cancer risk. In this case, the online physician responded by encouraging the patient to get a biopsy for evaluation and potential treatment. However, the response lacked comprehensiveness, empathy, and synchronicity. Verified-Physician Response A TR5 nodule is considered relatively high-risk nodule and the risk of cancer is higher in these nodules. Either way, the nodule is small and they are recommending biopsy. I’d encourage you to get the biopsy done to further evaluate as while there’s an association, biopsy remains better at predicting actual risk in many cases. Depending on the pathology, they may recommend either half the thyroid be taken out, or the entire thing. In someone who is hyperthyroid there may be benefit to total thyroidectomy. This physician response was analyzed in the study. In contrast, the LLM responses were more comprehensive, empathetic, and synchronous, evidenced by their length, style, and structure. ChatGPT-3.5 A TI-RADS 5 (TR5) nodule, especially one that is taller than wide and solid, can be concerning, but it doesn’t automatically mean it’s cancerous. The risk of malignancy is higher with TR5 nodules compared to lower TI-RADS categories. However, many TR5 nodules still turn out to be benign. The best way to determine whether the nodule is cancerous or not is through a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. This procedure involves taking a small sample of tissue from the nodule and analyzing it for cancerous cells. The FNA results will provide more accurate information about the nodule’s nature. It’s essential to follow your healthcare provider’s recommendations and proceed with the FNA biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. Thyroid cancer is generally treatable, especially when detected early, so timely evaluation and appropriate management are crucial. Your healthcare team will guide you through the necessary steps based on the biopsy results. GPT-4 A TR5 (TIRADS 5) classification on thyroid ultrasound indicates a high suspicion for malignancy, but it’s important to remember that not all TR5 nodules are cancerous. The classification is based on certain ultrasound characteristics, like being hypoechoic and taller-than-wide, which are more commonly associated with thyroid cancer. However, the definitive diagnosis of cancer can only be made through a biopsy. In your case, the presence of hyperthyroidism symptoms and a significant weight loss, along with the ultrasound findings, warrant a thorough evaluation. The recommended fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the hypoechoic nodule will provide more definitive information. FNA is a key tool in determining the nature of thyroid nodules, especially those with suspicious features. It’s understandable to be concerned about the possibility of cancer, but keep in mind that even in TR5 nodules, there are instances where the biopsy results come back benign. The outcome of the biopsy will guide the next steps in terms of treatment and management. Stay in close communication with your healthcare provider to discuss the biopsy results and the appropriate course of action based on those findings. Your medical team will consider your overall health, symptoms, and the biopsy results to provide the best care plan for you. These responses from ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were analyzed in the study. Some experts have raised concerns about LLMs providing dangerous and false information in response to patient questions. Although 13 percent of online physician responses were flagged as containing dangerous or false information, this only occurred with 1.3 percent and 0.4 percent of responses for ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively. “The results were striking. While LLMs or AI are not at a stage where they can replace us, they have a lot to offer in helping us perform better.” “The results were striking,” says Dr. Suh, associate vice chair of surgical innovation and principal investigator of the study. “While LLMs or AI are not at a stage where they can replace us, they have a lot to offer in helping us perform better.” For next steps, the researchers will prioritize the use of LLMs as a means to interact with patients seeking more information on thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, and postoperative care instructions. Across all metrics, LLMs showed the best performance when answering questions related to these topics, Dr. Patel explains. “We see this technology playing a critical role in helping physicians respond to patients promptly and effectively,” says Dr. Patel. “The surgeon will still review the responses before they are shared with the patient, ensuring there is minimal concern that the LLM is providing false or inaccurate information.” Before broader implementation, the real-world safety, efficiency, and accessibility of LLMs need to be established. Future studies will test the ability of LLMs to appropriately triage and escalate patient safety concerns, as well as fact-check information and references.

Alisa N. Femia, MD Dermatology, Skin Autoimmune Disorders Daniel R. Mazori, MD Andrea L. Neimann, MD Allergic & Contact Dermatology Services NYU Langone dermatologists have extensive experience and expertise in diagnosing , a form of skin inflammation that results from direct contact of a substance with the skin’s surface. Contact dermatitis often appears as a red, scaly rash and occasionally as blisters, crusting, and swelling. It can cause the skin to be itchy and even painful. To treat contact dermatitis, our doctors may prescribe oral medications or steroid creams. There are two types of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis, the most common form, typically occurs after exposure to chemicals that irritate the skin. Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when a substance triggers an allergic immune response. Substances that commonly cause allergic contact dermatitis include metals, fragrances, plants, dyes, preservatives, latex and synthetic rubber, and other chemicals found in everyday items. Our doctors partner with you to understand your symptoms, review your detailed medical history, and examine your skin for signs of contact dermatitis. Patch Testing for Allergic Contact Dermatitis If our dermatologists suspect that allergic contact dermatitis is causing a rash, a patch test is the most effective diagnostic tool. NYU Langone dermatologists have been leading experts in the technique of patch testing since the 1930s, when the patch test was first brought to the United States. This allergy test is uniquely designed to identify the cause of contact dermatitis
