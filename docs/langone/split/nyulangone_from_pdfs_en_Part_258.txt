of limited English speaking ability b. People with speech, hearing or visual impairments c. If the Applicant does not have plans to foster effective communication, what does the Independent Entity advise? Information provided by the Applicant indicates that they will communicate its services and care options to the community by using a standard, multi pronged advertising/communication plan. For individuals of limited English speaking ability, the Applicant will translate relevant materials such as marketing flyers, press releases, and in facility signage. There will be signage at the current locations in English and Spanish announcing the move and a letter in English and Spanish sent to patients. Clinic staff will also be communicating the details of this move at patient appointments well before it takes effect. Clinic staff will also alert patients as they call for appointments and when they are at their appointments in the current clinic prior to the move. The Applicant’s advertising/communication plan will also include outreach to specific publications that target individuals who speak a language other than English, particularly Spanish. The website will be updated with messaging about the move, and there will be social media posts as well. (Note that these are mainly in English.) Regarding individuals who have speech, hearing, or visual impairments, the Applicant uses digital best practices for accessibility that are informed by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2, the industry standard to ensure users with 18July 2024disabilities (such as vision, cognitive/learning, and/or motor disabilities) can access content equitably. 2. What specific changes are suggested so the project better meets the needs of each medically underserved group (identified above)? Among the low income community members who identified parking as a cost concern, there were 3 recommendations to mitigate this issue: • Post signage in both English and Spanish to communicate to patients that there is free parking available at the back of the building. • Inform patients through all of the communication vehicles indicated in the communication plan (e.g., marketing flyers, press releases, patient letters). • Have designated slots for Women’s Wellness Clinic parking spots, especially since a significant portion of the patient population is pregnant women coming for their appointments. There also should be a focus on how best to coordinate with local resources that will now be within blocks of the new location, especially services that support low income women (e.g. local health department’s food pantry program providing free formula and baby food to new mothers and their babies). 3. How can the Applicant engage and consult impacted stakeholders on forthcoming changes to the project? Given that the patients we engaged were a well rounded representative group of women seen at the clinic, the Applicant can engage and consult with those patients during implementation of to the project. We propose they be contacted 3 6 months after the relocation to speak to the impact of the project and be consulted on any potential improvements. We propose interviews, so the Applicant can get nuanced information and a patient survey across the clinic’s patients at the same time interval to capture broader perspectives about the relocation. A critical finding from the Independent Entity’s community engagement work was the power of community relationships as a channel of communication within the population the clinic serves. Several stakeholders shared how information about the clinic is shared within their community to other women, including newly arrived immigrants. This should be harnessed as a naturally occurring channel for communications about the clinic relocation and to get feedback on its impact. This could include interviews with people in the community who are identified by patients as trusted information sources. We recommend engaging them to inform the communication plan and its implementation as well as 3 6 months after the relocation to speak to the impact of the project and to be consulted for any potential improvements. 19July 2024 4. How does the project address systemic barriers to equitable access to services or care? If it does not, how can the project be modified? The relocation of the Women’s Wellness Clinic addresses systemic barriers to equitable access to services by providing an option for women to attend to their own health and the health of their children under one roof—making it more convenient and easier to navigate to healthcare services, especially for newly arrived immigrants and non English speakers. STEP 4 MONITORING 1. What are existing mechanisms and measures the Applicant already has in place that can be leveraged to monitor the potential impacts of the project? At the enterprise level, NYU’s Institute for Excellence in Health Equity develops, implements, and disseminates evidence based solutions to advance health equity in clinical care, medical education, and research. The Applicant has developed a health equity impact dashboard and has increased efforts to collect self reported data related to patient demographics in the electronic medical record to facilitate efforts to track the impact of different projects on medically underserved groups. The dashboard specifically includes data of all services and patients, including indicators such as race, ethnic background, gender/gender identity, age group, preferred language, financial class grouping, insurance grouping, median household income, and others. The Applicant plan to leverage this dashboard and data, as it does throughout its various projects, to reveal and address inequities and disparities. Additionally, Women’s Wellness outcomes are monitored through an existing dashboard fed by data derived from the Applicant’s Electronic Health Record, Epic. The dashboard provides a holistic view of health and healthcare services for patients across various service lines. Both clinic specific leadership and service line leadership at the organizational level review these dashboards to identify trends, including related to health disparities; summarize outcomes for hospital quality improvement committees; and create standardized processes for responding to necessary improvements. 2. What new mechanisms or measures can be created or put in place by the Applicant to ensure that the Applicant addresses the findings of the HEIA? New mechanisms the Applicant might consider implementing include requiring health equity training for staff and adding questions related to health equity to consumer satisfaction surveys. Using the definitions provided by the State, the Applicant can re work their internal dashboards to report changes in metrics for the specific medically underserved groups identified to better align with the way other organizations and the 20July 2024State are measuring and monitoring outcomes. As stated, the Applicant may also consider continuously engaging with patients engaged in this process and community members to obtain qualitative input about how changes have been received and what improvements could be made. This will help ensure the success of this project and inform future projects of a similar nature. Some examples of measures that can be monitored to ensure continued equity amongst patients are vaginal delivery/C section rates. The Applicant can follow patients who are seen in the Women’s Wellness Clinic and subsequently give birth at the hospital and then stratify results by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (i.e., payor group), and other demographics to evaluate if there are adverse impacts on patients from medically underserved groups. The Applicant conducts quality reviews of these data across the enterprise on a quarterly basis, particularly for maternity care, as this data is used for transparent hospital quality reports by US News and World Report. US News and World Report quality measures include C section rates in lower risk pregnancies, newborn complication rates, exclusive breast milk feeding rates, early elective delivery rates, birthing friendly practices, and transparency on racial/ethnic disparities, among other measures. (Source: https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press room/articles/2023 12 05/u s news world report announces the 2024 best hospitals for maternity care#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20News%20Best%20Hospitals,and%20transparency%20on%20racial%2Fethnic) Additionally, the applicant is undergoing a new process of prescribing iron regiments with hematology referrals to patients within the clinic, as rates of anemia among pregnant women of color occur at a higher rate than white pregnant women. Through this intervention, the Women’s Wellness Clinic aims to optimize hemoglobin levels of at risk patients prior to newborn delivery for increased health outcomes for both the newborn and the mother. We encourage the Applicant to continue monitoring this as part of their efforts to ensure health equity among all clinic patients. STEP 5 DISSEMINATION The Applicant is required to publicly post the CON application and the HEIA on its website within one week of acknowledgement by the Department. The Department will also publicly post the CON application and the HEIA through NYSE CON within one week of the filing.

LhotaHempstead Women's WellnessJoseph J. LhotaSep 25, 2024Executive Vice President and Vice Dean, Chief of Staff, ChiefFinancial Officer 22July 2024Through the implementation of this project, NYULH aims to enhance the patient experience and ensure patients are receiving the superior care that they deserve. While the HEIA highlighted some potential concerns from stakeholders, NYULH would like to reiterate it is very early in the planning process and is able to give all concerns strong consideration. Operations in the new Women’s Wellness location will mimic and build upon the current operations of the Women’s Wellness location to promote a straightforward onboarding process. The parking area in the new location is a free parking deck and accommodates more vehicles than the current location’s surface lot. NYULH will ensure adequate signage promotion in English and Spanish to notify patients to park in the new location’s parking deck instead of paid street parking to avoid additional costs during their visit.
