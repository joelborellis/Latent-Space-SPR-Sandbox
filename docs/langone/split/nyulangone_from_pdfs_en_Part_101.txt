NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines INCLUSIVE DESIGN Real Estate Development and Facilities 105 2024 INCLUSIVE DESIGN NYU Langone Health is committed to providing an environment that is accessible and inclusive for our patients, visitors, students and staff. In line with that effort RED+F has developed this subsection in collaboration with NYU Langone’s Rusk Rehabilitation and the Disability Inclusion Team to assist Architects and Interior Designers to better serve diverse patient populations in our clinical areas, particularly in areas that are more likely to serve higher volumes of patients with mobility disabilities (i.e. orthopedics, rehabilitation, rheumatology, etc.). The information provided includes: 1. Clinical Waiting Room Design 2. Automatic Door Operators 3. Helpful Resources This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of designing a project that is code compliant and appropriate to the needs of the user. The Architect and Interior Designer may suggest layouts and products not shown in these guidelines if they believe the proposed layouts and products support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project. 1. Clinical Waiting Room Design  Seating Capacity Refer to the Space Planning subsection.  Clear Floor Space for Assistive Mobility Devices (i.e. wheelchairs, scooters, reclining wheelchairs, etc.) Provide the following: At least of the total required seating shall be ADA compliant clear floor space Clear Floor Space shall be: 36” x 48” clear distributed throughout the seating area located along circulation paths provided adjacent to companion seating oriented or facing in the same direction as adjacent seating provided adjacent to power outlets and side tables, whenever possible  Waiting Room Furniture Provide the following: of the total required seating shall be hip seating ganged or weighted seating to minimize reconfiguration by the end user  Signage Provide signage at the wall or on the armrest of adjacent seating at designated spaces for Assistive Mobility Devices.  Circulation Clearances for Assistive Mobility Devices Provide the following: Min. 48” clear circulation path 67” turning diameter to accommodate powered Assistive Mobility Devices  Sample Clinical Waiting Room Layout Refer to the Space Planning subsection. NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines INCLUSIVE DESIGN Real Estate Development and Facilities 106 2024 2. Automatic Door Operators: Specify automatic door operators on:  All Clinical Building Exterior Doors,  All Clinical Departmental Entrances, and/or  Doors between waiting areas/rooms and clinical areas beyond where the patient population is likely to have mobility issues (i.e. orthopedics, rehabilitation, rheumatology etc.).

In line with that effort RED+F has developed this subsection in collaboration with NYU Langone’s Occupational & Industrial Orthopedic Center (OIOC) to encourage Architects and Interior Designers to consider user body size, strength and range of motion as well as surrounding environmental factors in the design of our projects. The information provided includes: 1. Ergonomic Design Considerations 2. Helpful Resources This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of designing a project that is code compliant and appropriate to the needs of the user. The Architect and Interior Designer may suggest layouts and products not shown in these guidelines if they believe the proposed layouts and products support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project. 1. Ergonomic Design Considerations When applying ergonomics, the Architect and Interior Designer shall consider the nature of the user (physical body dimensions and any individual limitation), the type of task(s) they perform, the layout of the workspace, the work organization, and the equipment/tools used. The primary focus is to create the most efficient and injury free interface between people and the tools and technology they use. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider the following:  Human Body The Architect and Interior Designer should familiarize themselves with anthropometric data, which provides a good understanding of body measurement variation and movement limitation for the main user population. Having a good grasp of this information will allow the A/E Team to provide for appropriate: Clearances (i.e. headroom, elbow room, legroom, etc.) between the body and surrounding objects, https://slideplayer.com/slide/3410524/ NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 108 2024 Reach towards objects and equipment allowing for placement and adjustment of these items in appropriate reach zones, and https://www.bostontec.com/ergonomics/ Posture, promoting healthy and safe body positioning through responsible furniture layouts and selection. https://www.joionline.net/library/show/ergonomics_in_the_workplace/ NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 109 2024 NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 110 2024 Further, Architects and Interior Designers should understand that most designed furniture targets the 5th 95th percentile of users, or of the user population. This means that the expectation is that their designs meet the needs of of our users. For the of users outside of this range, NYU Langone will assess the workspace, as requested, and provide recommendations to the end user. Architects and Interiors Designers should integrate adjustability and flexibility into their furniture layouts and selections. https://www.bostontec.com/ergonomics/  Environment The Architect and Interior Designer should keep the following items in mind during design, including relevant code requirements and industry standards: Light To minimize end user eye strain Architects and Interior Designers should ensure that artificial lighting is not too bright, natural light does not impede the use of equipment such as computer or digital screens, glare is minimized from both artificial and natural sources, and task lighting is provided accordingly. The use of proper lighting equipment and controls as well as window drapes and shades should be integrated into the design. Ventilation Architects and Interior Designers should ensure that users have adequate fresh air ventilation and heating or cooling so that they feel comfortable when working. Noise Noise can cause stress leading to tensed muscles increasing the risk of injury. Architects and Interior Designers should locate and arrange workstations to allow for quiet surroundings around work areas, wherever possible. 2.

NYU Langone Health Design Guidelines ROOM FINISHES Real Estate Development and Facilities 111 2024 ROOM FINISHES In accordance with both our Mission devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research and our Design Principles of providing timeless designs that are cost effective, efficient, functional and practical, RED+F has developed a palette of typical materials and finishes that we have found to be successful for various spaces at NYU Langone Health. Our goals in listing these materials and finishes are to:  Streamline the design process  Assist the Architect and Interior Designer with specifying materials  Comply with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all materials and finishes  Create spaces that are timeless, durable, easily maintainable and cost effective  Create a consistent NYU Langone brand The Architect and Interior Designer should use this as a guide for specifying the finishes on NYU Langone capital projects. This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of specifying materials that are appropriate and code compliant for specific spaces. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider specifying existing building specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Also, the Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other materials and finishes if they believe those proposed materials and finishes will support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project.
