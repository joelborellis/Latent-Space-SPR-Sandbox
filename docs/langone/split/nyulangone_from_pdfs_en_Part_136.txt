It was in desperate need of hope, help, and healing. A new approach to caring for our community was required. Forward thinking residents and local healthcare leadership worked together, and, in partnership with the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity, opened Sunset Park Family Health Center, an innovation in community care. The opening of the Family Health Center was an indelible first step in Sunset Park’s revival and reshaped future. Historic Milestones and Accomplishments1967: With a $4 million grant from the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity, the Sunset Park Family Health Center is opened to provide medical services to area residents. 1974: A national Dental Residency program is launched.Seven more primary care centers are opened: Family Physician 1968 Sunset Terrace 1984Park Slope 1991Shore Road 1996Park Ridge 1998Flatbush 1998Seventh Avenue 200250TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 3HISTORY4 FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS AT NYU LANGONE4 FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS AT NYU LANGONESunset Park, 2017Historic Milestones and Accomplishments2000: Family Health Centers network received the federal Bureau of Primary Health Care’s “Cultural Competence Award” in recognition of our promise to deliver culturally competent primary care. 2002: Family Health Centers received the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Administrator’s Award for increasing access to care and reducing health disparities. 2010: Acquired the Community Medicine Program for homeless persons, formerly operated by the now closed St. Vincent Medical Centers. The program currently includes 11 sites in three boroughs offering primary care, health screenings, urgent care, crisis intervention, and counseling to more than 7,000 New Yorkers who are homeless or at risk. Serving Sunset Park The Sunset Park of today is different than it was in 1967. Diverse, vibrant, and confident, the 2017 version of Sunset Park still has its struggles but is living proof of what can happen when people work together. Today, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone is nationally recognized for innovative, affordable, high quality care, and is one of the largest employers within the communities we serve. What began in 1967 as a grassroots pilot program has evolved and grown into a multifaceted, comprehensive system of culturally competent healthcare and social services, delivered through a network of convenient locations throughout all of Brooklyn and other parts of NYC. As true health and community revival innovators, we established: • the largest national dental residency program • the largest school health program in New York • a community medical program serving more than 7,000 homeless New Yorkers • Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) programs • one of the first health focused AmeriCorps programs 50TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 5HISTORY6 FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS AT NYU LANGONELarry K. McReynolds, Executive Director Kathy Hopkins, Vice President, Community Based Programs Astrid P. Gonzalez, Vice President, Finance50TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 7Since we began in 1967, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone has grown into one of the nation’s largest federally qualified health center networks. Since then, we remain staunchly dedicated to providing high quality primary care and social support services in the right place, at the right time, to the most vulnerable patients. Most of our population is in need of healthcare, education, and a safe place to live. Our role is to ensure they receive that support regardless of changes in healthcare politics or funding.As health innovators, we will work to remain the preferred choice for the best healthcare experience possible for all generations through every stage of life. I am here and I am all in because I—along with the NYU Langone leadership—firmly believe in our unique model for healthcare, and that every individual and family in our community deserves quality care and the best chance for a healthy, productive life. We look back over the past 50 years with gratitude and pride, and look steadily forward with optimism and confidence. We have a solid plan and a vibrant future. I firmly believe the best years for our network are yet to come. We are here to provide sustainable care to the communities we serve.Larry K. McReynoldsExecutive Director, Family Health Centers at NYU Langone and SVP, Community Health at NYU Langone HealthLETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR8 FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS AT NYU LANGONESupporting each patient and family as a wholeEarly on, we recognized our active involvement had to extend well beyond our neighbors’ injuries or illnesses. We needed to redefine the notion of healthcare, and broaden it to combine medical services with social services that support numerous aspects of our patients’ lives such as literacy, education, employment, housing, and more. For example, our Healthy Families program provides support services for the entire family. Specially trained members of the community are matched to families for home visits. Each family receives an assessment covering areas of potential health, social, and economic need, and the support provided is then tailored to address those needs.Our approach is to care for each person, and each family, as a whole entity. That is the foundation of our work and one of the key factors to achieve long term chances of improved health and the delivery of results that change lives.PATIENT CAREHelping new moms and babies get a healthy start50TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 9Patients who are truly involved in their own care are more likely to understand and follow their caregivers’ suggestions, leading to better healthcare experiences and outcomes.That’s the main idea behind our innovative obstetrics program. It starts with a diverse medical team—well versed in pregnancy, birth, delivery, and childcare—that meets regularly with small groups of moms to be at shared appointments to educate them about pregnancy, labor, delivery, and parenthood, as well as the importance of dental care, pediatric care, and car seat safety.The shared appointments foster friendships between the moms to be and help them develop a commitment to take good care of themselves and their babies before and after delivery. Our program offers incentives to women to meet important health targets, such as attending all their appointments and completing recommended testing. When they do, we arrange a group baby shower, and give them diaper bags stocked with assorted baby products.Our goal is to help every one of our expectant moms, their babies, and their families create a healthy life by offering programs to support healthy beginnings and good health at every life stage. BENEFITS OF A SHARED MEDICAL APPOINTMENT:• No waiting room time• More time—90 minutes—with the doctor and healthcare team• Comprehensive appointments include private exams, if needed• Support from peers and health team• More health and wellness informationNote: Participants at a shared medical appointment agree not to disclose other patients’ medical information they may hear at the appointment. At a July 2017 group baby shower, we surprised new moms with gifts of assorted baby products.PATIENT CARE10 FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS AT NYU LANGONE50TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 10Providing a medical home to an entire communityWe provide high quality, affordable healthcare to every patient, regardless of health condition, life circumstance, or economic position. We are our patients’ medical home, a place where they can relax, feel they belong, and know they are genuinely cared for. At all of our care sites, cohesive teams of doctors, nurses, and specialists work together with the best interest of each patient in mind. These caregivers speak our patients’ languages, and not only understand, but may also share cultural backgrounds. The patient doctor relationships that develop here are one on one, proactive, and mutually respectful. Our patients believe we can help them because they see results in their friends, neighbors, and often their own family members. In fact, we treat many generations of the same family.PATIENT CARE50TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 11PATIENT CAREDelivering greater healthcare valueEmpowering patients for better self careOur unique model of value based community care generates better health outcomes as well as improved efficiency and financial viability for care delivery to all our populations. Our integrated medical and social support services allow us to detect illnesses and conditions earlier; encourage preventive care; provide education and resources for managing chronic conditions; prevent problems that can come with fragmented care such as duplication of tests, missed areas of care, or potential drug interactions; and help with other medical concerns. This adds up to fewer, shorter hospital stays and less frequent use of emergency services, which is better for individual patients and contributes to greater economy throughout the system. Smarter, more efficient care reduces the burden of illness on our patients and of healthcare costs for all of us.Including patients as members of their healthcare team, not simply as passive recipients of care, is key, because in the end, the power to heal is in their hands. An engaged patient is one who sees the value of better results and accepts responsibility for cooperating in their care and living a healthier lifestyle. The value of the services we offer is magnified greatly when patients continue beyond the things that we can provide, adopting behaviors and habits to maintain their health and well being. Very often, people face barriers to getting and staying healthy. These barriers may include the inability to find or afford local healthcare providers; low literacy; unstable housing; fear; or a sense of unworthiness. We work hard every day to transform healthcare in Brooklyn and beyond, and to make certain it is within reach for everyone in the communities we serve. To address the key barriers to health, we offer culturally adapted programs for asthma, diabetes, breast cancer, and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. We continue to expand our current programs and develop new ones to meet the ever evolving needs of our community: • Proactive outreach programs remind patients about screenings, immunizations, and appointments, improving health outcomes. • Educational services address adult and family literacy skills. Our classes facilitate communications between patients and medical providers, increase employability, and prepare children for school success. • Nutritional training programs teach people of all ages how to shop for and prepare wholesome meals that are light on their budgets and good for their bodies. • Professional training opportunities immerse new doctors in family medicine, obstetrics, and internal medicine in the realities of a complex, multicultural, urban healthcare practice. Their fresh insights and ideas help us develop additional ways to reach our population. • Integrating medical care, behavioral health, and dental programs into community schools provides families with greater access to primary and preventive care for their children, including consistent treatment for chronic conditions. • Behavioral healthcare services address the whole person, recognizing that mental health plays a significant role in overall health and well being. 12 FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS AT NYU LANGONERemoving barriers to health and well beingPATIENT CARE50TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 13I clearly remember starting my residency at the Family Health Centers. My first patient came in, sat in the chair, and when I spoke to her, she did not respond. I spoke only English, a language she did not understand. That was my first exposure to community healthcare in a diverse population. Gradually, I began to understand the complexities of community care and the serious challenges so many of our patients faced. I got closely involved with my patients and learned that dentists—good dentists—provide so much more than oral care. Although I was happy at the Family Health Centers, the lure of private practice in my home state won me over and when my residency ended, I moved on. But my heart had been altered. Private practice was good, but the feeling wasn’t the same as it was at the Family Health Centers. I missed the patients and families I had come to know, and I missed playing a role in something much bigger. At the Family Health Centers, my colleagues and I were part of an integrated medical and social services network that wrapped itself around our patients and helped change their lives. Dental care can be a gateway to a person’s overall health and at the Family Health Centers, I could bring all the pieces together for my patients. Knowing I had found my calling—the place I could truly make a difference—I returned to the Family Health Centers and focused on amplifying our efforts and value in the community. Our approach here is not typical of a dental office. We look at the whole person first. We take blood pressure readings, offer diabetes and oral cancer screenings, and even review things like medications and diet. I hired a manager of special populations and an outreach manager to help engage our neighbors—the whole community from children to seniors. We are connected with our community. And isn’t that what community care is all about? Margaret Mason, DMD, Vice President of Dental Medicine, is surrounded by the team of dentists and dental residents at Sunset Park Family Health Center. STORIESMargaret: A doctor’s connectionThe 2011 economic downturn pummeled my sports marketing business. Add in a divorce after 30 years of marriage and I was in debt. I’d always been a social drinker with clients and friends, but given my circumstances, I began drinking heavily to fight off depression and anxiety. Feelings of failure were closing in. Even my resourcefulness and wherewithal abandoned me. I felt stripped of worth. Alone. Desperate to end it all, I slit my throat. Two days later, when my landlord came to evict me, he found me unconscious, soaked in my own blood. I spent the next three blurry months in a psychiatric ward followed by a month in a rehabilitation program in Yonkers before I landed in Bowery Residents’ Committee homeless shelter on West 25th Street in Manhattan. That’s where I ran into Dr. Marc Rabiner from the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, and experienced a jolt of long lost hope. Immediately drawn to him, I was blown away that he remembered me from our first meeting two months earlier. When I say remembered, I mean not just my name, but he remembered and truly “got” everything about me—my story, background, struggles, journey, and even my goals. He brushed past my present day situation and saw me as a person with a heart, dreams, and capabilities. With sincere compassion and without passing judgment on me, he quickly connected me to other professionals and services at the Family Health Centers, and that’s when all the pieces came together. Working as a team, they carried and supported me step by step from one service to the next without a gap—psychiatry, behavioral health, medical management, dental, employment assistance—whatever I needed. They transformed my journey from one of recovery to one of total restoration. Everyone from the receptionist to the counselors and medical staff knew and cared about me and became my champion. They were kind, professional, and honest, and helped me reach down deep into my well of strength, do the hard work, and raise myself up. To this day, Dr. Rabiner continues to be my primary care physician and friend, and the Family Health Centers is my medical home. I can go anywhere for care, but I choose them. They continually provide me with all the medical services I need—even preventive care that has helped me avoid larger potential health issues. I trust them to do what’s best for me. And I truly like them as people. This is just a small sliver of my story. I doubt I would be where I am today if Dr. Rabiner hadn’t seen into my heart and taken me into his care—or without the diligent care and support from every single person at the Family Health Centers. Today, Philip is sober, healthy, happy, and very proud to be actively engaged in helping other people restore their lives. He splits his time between his patient advocacy work, relaxing with his two adult children, growing his consulting business, and creating positive change by serving on several boards in Brooklyn and other parts of NYC. “Dr. Rabiner was my first real anchor.”“I always felt everyone’s deep compassion and caring.”STORIESPhilip: A patient’s second chance14 FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS AT NYU LANGONE50TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 15Standing ready for the next 50 years and beyondWe are setting a course for our next chapter to continually redefine possibility and advance how we serve and support our diverse community. Our knowledge of patient centered community healthcare and expertise in population health management, combined with the sophisticated tools and technology of NYU Langone Health facilitates tremendous growth in the services we can offer. We are working with NYU Langone Health to identify which community interventions and programs deliver the most impact to transform and improve health. The challenges we face, both social and medical, will always be changing. However, our model for patient involvement, attention to the whole person, and caring for our community will keep us on the right track to meet those challenges.FUTURE 16 FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS AT NYU LANGONESummer 2016 marked the successful culmination of a massive undertaking at the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone and the entire Brooklyn campus—the implementation of the Epic electronic health record platform. Epic improves safety and efficiency, and offers patients greater access to their own health information, and, working in tandem with other advances in technology, it allows the Family Health Centers to implement exciting new programs that not long ago would have sounded like fiction. Here are two examples: TelepsychiatryThe Family Health Centers at NYU Langone will pilot a new telepsychiatry program at two of its 22 Brooklyn school sites. Children in grades K through 12 will use computer terminals for video linked psychiatric appointments. Aided by the school’s behavioral health social worker during the video session, a child will meet with a psychiatrist who can assess the child’s behavioral health needs, as well as conduct ongoing or follow up treatment. The psychiatrist’s notes post automatically to the child’s medical records, making them available to his or her other healthcare providers, greatly enhancing the ability to treat the whole child. Teleretinal scanningIn partnership with NYU Langone’s Department of Ophthalmology, this innovative program will help the Family Health Centers ensure that core quality standards are met for their patients. Retinal images will be quickly and painlessly taken by confocal laser scanners located at the three centers with the largest diabetic populations. These images will be conveyed electronically to an ophthalmologist who can determine if the patient requires treatment. These and other initiatives showcase the commitment that the Family Health Centers and NYU Langone Health have to delivering care to its patients.Bringing the future to today’s medicineFrom left: Eric Doescher, assistant vice president for administration and network integration, Larry McReynolds, and Isaac Dapkins, MD, chief medical officerFUTURE50TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY 17Sunset Park Family Health Center at NYU LangoneAdult Medicine, Dental and Specialty150 55th Street Brooklyn, NY 11220718 630 7095Sunset Park Family Health Center at NYU LangoneWomen’s Health, Pediatrics, and Pediatric Rehabilitation5610 Second Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11220718 630 7942 Seventh Avenue Family Health Center at NYU Langone5008 Seventh Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11220718 210 1030Flatbush Family Health Center at NYU Langone3414 Church Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11203718 630 2197Family Physician Family Health Center at NYU Langone5616 Sixth Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11220718 439 5440Park Ridge Family Health Center at NYU Langone6317 Fourth Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11220718 907 8100 Park Slope Family Health Center at NYU Langone220 13th Street Brooklyn, NY 11215718 832 5980Shore Road Family Health Center at NYU Langone9000 Shore Road Brooklyn, NY 11209718 630 8870Sunset Terrace Family Health Center at NYU Langone514 49th Street Brooklyn, NY 11220718 431 2600Network sites and programsPrimary Care SitesBarbara S.
