Increases occurred from 2016 to 2020, with a larger annual percent change from 2019 to 2020 () compared with the average annual percent change from 2016 to 2019 () overall and for nearly every characteristic analyzed. In 2020, the rate of GDM varied by maternal race and Hispanic origin; among the six largest race and Hispanic origin groups, the rate was highest for non Hispanic Asian (14.) and lowest for non Hispanic Black (6.) women. Variation in the GDM rate among the Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and Hispanic subgroups was also seen. The GDM rate rose with increasing maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, and plurality. By state, for 2020, the GDM rate ranged from a low of 4. in Mississippi to a high of 12. in Alaska. Keywords: GDM • race and Hispanic origin • births • National Vital Statistics System Introduction The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth includes information on two types of diabetes (defined as glucose intolerance requiring treatment), prepregnancy (diagnosis of diabetes before pregnancy) and gestational (diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy) (1 3). Differentiating between the two types of diabetes is important because, although both are established risk factors for several adverse maternal and infant health outcomes, the conditions occur at different frequencies and have different impacts on pregnancy outcomes (4 9). The focus of this report is on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which is specific to pregnancy and occurs more frequently than prepregnancy diabetes (10 12). GDM is a common complication in pregnancy (8,13), affecting about of pregnancies in the United States annually (10,11,14). The presence of GDM can lead to negative health outcomes for both mothers and infants. Adverse health outcomes for the mother include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life, GDM in subsequent pregnancies, maternal hypertensive disorders, and having a cesarean delivery (5,8,10,15 19). Adverse health outcomes for the infant include an increased risk of preterm birth and macrosomia, and the development of type 2 diabetes later in life (5,8,17 19). Studies have found increasing GDM rates over time in both the United States and internationally (9,12,20 24), and a larger increase in GDM during the COVID 19 pandemic compared with prepandemic times (25 27). National information on GDM became available for the first time in 2016. This report presents overall trends in GDM among women giving birth in the United States from 2016 through 2020 and rates of GDM by maternal race and Hispanic origin, age, body mass index (BMI), state of residence, and plurality for 2016, 2019, and 2020. Methods This analysis uses data from the birth certificate and is based on of births registered in the United States for 2016 through 2020. Trend analysis was performed using 2016 2020 data and a more detailed analysis was conducted on 2020 data. Comparisons are made between 2016 and 2019, 2019 and 2020, and 2016 and 2020 for the overall GDM rate and all other characteristics. These time periods were selected to examine the full time period for which final national GDM data are currently available (2016 2020) and to examine changes in GDM before (2016 2019) and during (2020) the COVID 19 pandemic. The GDM item was added to the birth certificate with the 2003 revision and was reported by all states as of 2016. Birth certificate data on GDM is recommended to be collected from the mother’s medical records (1). Mothers are to be reported as having GDM if there is a diagnosis of glucose intolerance requiring treatment during this pregnancy in her medical record (2). Of the 3,613,647 births registered in the United States for 2020, 4,063, or 0., were missing GDM information. Data on BMI were missing for 1. (70,408) of births and data on Hispanic origin were missing for 0. (33,946) of births. Births with missing values for race (251,440 or 7.), age (300 or 0.), and plurality (95 or 0.) were imputed. Records missing information on GDM, BMI, and Hispanic origin were excluded from analyses. Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the birth certificate and are self reported by the mother. All race and Hispanic origin groups are based on single race reporting and are consistent with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards (28). Maternal race and Hispanic origin categories presented are non Hispanic White, non Hispanic Black, non Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), non Hispanic Asian, non Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI), and Hispanic. Data on non Hispanic Asian (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Other Asian), NHOPI (Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan, and Other Pacific Islander), and Hispanic (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, and Other and unknown Hispanic) subgroups are also shown. Maternal prepregnancy BMI is calculated from prepregnancy weight and height according to the following formula (29): mother’s prepregnancy weight (lb) • 703 mother’s height (in)2 The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides a calculated categorization of maternal prepregnancy BMI that aligns with that established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (30) for all adults. Categories are: • Underweight is BMI less than 18.5 • Normal weight is BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 • Overweight is BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 • Obese is BMI of 30.0 and over. Plurality is defined as the number of fetuses delivered live or dead at any time in the pregnancy regardless of gestational age, or if the fetuses were delivered at different dates in the pregnancy 3 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 71, No. 3, July 19, 2022 (2). Plurality is classified as singleton, twin, and triplet and higher order births. GDM rates are expressed as the number of live births to women with GDM per 100 live births. All statements about differences in rates in the text have been tested for statistical significance, and statements that a given rate is higher or lower than another rate indicate that the rates are significantly different using a two tailed z test at the alpha level of 0.05 (31). References to decreasing or increasing trends in rates (for example, trends in rates for 2016 2020) are statistically significant at the 0.05 level and were assessed using the Cochran Armitage test for trends, a modified chi squared test. Comparisons between state rates and the U.S. rate account for the individual state’s contribution to the U.S. rate. Therefore, each state rate is compared with a unique U.S. rate, independent of the state’s contribution to the total U.S. rate. The reliability of percentages was evaluated based on standards developed by NCHS. For detailed information on the standards, see “National Center for Health Statistics Data Presentation Standards for Proportions” (32). Results Overall trends • The number of GDM cases increased from 2016 (234,847) to 2020 (281,789) (Table 1). • The number of GDM cases rose by an average of annually from 2016 to 2019 and then rose from 2019 to 2020. • The GDM rate increased from 2016 (6.) to 2020 (7.) (Table 1 and Figure 1). • The GDM rate rose by an average of annually from 2016 to 2019 and then rose from 2019 to 2020. Trends and differences by maternal race and Hispanic origin • In 2020, among the six largest race and Hispanic origin groups, the rate of GDM was lowest for non Hispanic Black women (6.), followed by non Hispanic White (7.), Hispanic (8.), non Hispanic NHOPI (10.), non Hispanic AIAN (11.), and non Hispanic Asian (14.) women (Table 2 and Figure 2). • Among non Hispanic Asian subgroups, the GDM rate was highest for Asian Indian women (16.), followed by Vietnamese and Filipino (15. for each), Chinese (13.), Korean (11.), and Japanese (9.) women. • Among non Hispanic NHOPI subgroups, the GDM rate was highest for Guamanian (13.) and Samoan (12.) women and lowest for Hawaiian women (8.). • Among the Hispanic origin subgroups, the GDM rate was highest for Mexican women (8.), followed by Dominican (8.) and Puerto Rican (8.), Cuban (7.), and Central and South American (7.) women.

SOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics System, Natality. 4 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 71, No. 3, July 19, 2022 • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased for all but one of the race and Hispanic origin groups studied. Rates rose from (NHOPI) to (non Hispanic Black) among the six largest groups, by (Asian Indian and Vietnamese) to (Korean) among the Asian subgroups, and by (Central and South American) to (Cuban) among the Hispanic subgroups. Among the NHOPI subgroups, rates increased from (Hawaiian) to (Samoan); the increase for Hawaiian women was not signifcant (Table 2). • GDM rates rose by from 2019 to 2020 for each of the race and Hispanic origin groups except the Hawaiian subgroup. In comparison, for 2016 2019, GDM rates rose an average of per year for each group except for NHOPI women overall and each NHOPI subgroup. Trends and differences by maternal age • In 2020, the GDM rate increased with increasing age of the mother, from 2. for women under age 20 to 15. for those aged 40 and over (Table 3 and Figure 3). • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased for each maternal age group, ranging from (for mothers aged 40 and over) to (for those aged 20 24). • GDM rates rose for each age group from 2019 to 2020, with increases ranging from to . In comparison, from 2016 to 2019, an average annual percentage increase of in GDM rates was seen for each age group. Trends and differences by maternal BMI • In 2020, the GDM rate increased with increasing maternal BMI, from 3. for underweight women, to 4. for those who were normal weight, to 7. for those who were overweight, to 12. for those with obesity (Table 3 and Figure 4). • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased for each BMI category, from for women with obesity to for women who were underweight or normal weight. • GDM rates rose by from 2019 to 2020 for each BMI category. In comparison, from 2016 to 2019, an average annual percentage increase of in GDM rates was seen for each BMI category. Trends and differences by plurality • In 2020, the GDM rate increased with increasing plurality, from 7. among mothers having a singleton birth, to 9. for mothers of twins, to 13. for mothers of triplet and higher order multiple births (Table 3). • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased for women having singletons (), twins (), and triplet and higher order multiple births (). • GDM rates increased from 2019 to 2020 among mothers of singletons (), twins (), and triplet and higher order multiple births (). In comparison, for 2016 2019, the Figure 3. Rate of gestational diabetes, by age of mother: United States, 2020 NOTE: Significant increasing trend (p < 0.05).

SOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics System, Natality. average annual percentage increase was for mothers of singletons and for mothers of twins. The increase for mothers of triplets and higher order multiple births was not signifcant. Trends and differences by state of residence • In 2020, the GDM rate ranged from a low of 4. in Mississippi to a high of 12. in Alaska (Table 4 and Figure 5). • Compared with the U.S. rate of 7., the GDM rate was lower in 23 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.), higher in 21 states, and not signifcantly different in 6 states. • From 2016 to 2020, the GDM rate increased in 48 states and D.C. Increases ranged from in Connecticut, New Mexico, and South Carolina to in Wyoming. Increases in the remaining two states (North Dakota and West Virginia) were not signifcant (Table 4 and Figure 6). • Increases of were observed for 46 states and D.C. from 2019 to 2020. Increases for the remaining four states (Connecticut, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming) were not signifcant. In comparison, from 2016 to 2019, the average annual percent change ranged from to for 45 states and D.C. Changes for the remaining fve states were not signifcant. Discussion This report found that the overall GDM rate was 7. in 2020, an increase of from 2019 (6.) and from 2016 (6.). A larger annual percent change from 2019 to 2020 () than from 2016 to 2019 (average annual increase of ) was observed. From 2016 to 2020, GDM rates increased for every category of all characteristics analyzed, though increases for the Hawaiian subgroup and two states were not significant. Rates also increased between 2019 and 2020 for nearly all groups. The annual percent change from 2019 to 2020 was larger than the average annual percent change from 2016 to 2019 for nearly all categories of all characteristics analyzed, except changes for Hawaiian and Cuban women and nine states. In 2020, variation in the GDM rate was observed across race and Hispanic origin groups and subgroups. Among the six largest race and Hispanic origin groups, the rate for the group with the highest rate (non Hispanic Asian women) was more than double the rate for the group with the lowest rate (non Hispanic Black women). Among the Hispanic subgroups, rates were lowest for Central and South American women and highest for Mexican women. Among the Asian subgroups, the lowest rate was observed for Japanese women and the highest for Asian Indian women. For the NHOPI subgroup, the lowest rate was observed for Hawaiian women and the highest for Guamanian and Samoan women. The GDM rate rose with increasing age, BMI, and plurality. By state of residence, Alaska had the highest GDM rate, more than two and one half times higher than that for Mississippi, which had the lowest rate. 6 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 71, No. 3, July 19, 2022 Figure 5. Rate of gestational diabetes, by state of residence: United States, 2020 SOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics System, Natality. These findings are generally consistent with the findings of other studies, though some disagreement exists in the literature as to whether rates are lowest for non Hispanic Black or non Hispanic White women (5,10,17,33 42). Recent studies have also observed larger increases in GDM during the COVID 19 pandemic compared with prepandemic times (25 27). The larger than average increase in GDM during 2019 2020 may be related, in part, to changes observed in the general and at risk populations (including pregnant women), such as decreased physical activity, weight gain, and other lifestyle factors that are known to impact GDM (43 48). Limitations Underreporting of health conditions is considered a primary limitation of birth certificate data (49 50). Two studies that examined data from the 2003 birth certificate revision for three vital statistics reporting areas found low levels of sensitivity (a measure of underreporting) for GDM across all three reporting areas, ranging from 57. to 59. (51,52). However, the Kappa scores (a more conservative measure of agreement) were found to be moderate to substantial, ranging from 0.55 to 0.68 (51,52). Conclusion GDM is a common complication in pregnancy that can lead to negative health outcomes for both mothers and infants. A primary advantage of birth certificate data is that information is collected on all women giving birth in the United States each year, allowing for analysis of both national trends and trends for smaller population groups, such as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander subgroups. Despite concerns with potential reporting issues, trends and patterns in the GDM rate shown in this report are generally consistent with those of other studies and these data provide opportunities to examine GDM among a large population of women giving birth in the United States.
