Our model includes core strategies and activities in McCullum et. al. evidence based Three Stage Community Food Security Continuum, including: Connecting emergency food programs with local urban agriculture projects o There is some evidence that food pantries that use healthy food initiatives increase fruit and vegetable consumption, improve diet quality, and increase food security. Program evaluations of comprehensive healthy food initiatives similar to ours are associated with significant improvements in food security, self sufficiency, and diet quality over time. Initiative components that have been associated with these outcomes are: McCullum, C., Desjardins, E., Kraak, V. I., Ladipo, P., & Costello, H. (2005).

Greenlight As part of the NIH funded multi site cluster randomized study, children who received Greenlight had a lower BMI z score at 4, 6, 12, 15 and 18 months of age. There were also reductions in obesogenic behaviors, including less juice consumption by children, among families who received Greenlight. The Greenlight intervention incorporates evidence based messages related to child obesity based on comprehensive review of evidence. Sanders LM, Perrin EM, Yin HS, et al.

Tobacco Free Community Quiteline interventions, particularly proactive quitlines (i.e. those that offer follow up counseling calls) have been shown to be effective. Kuiper N, Zhang L, Lee J, et al. A national Asian language smokers’ quitline — United States, 2012 2014. Prev Chronic Dis. 2015;12:E99. Intervention Evidence Citations For example, telephone counseling found to be effective for Chinese , Korean , and Vietnamese speaking smokers measuring 6 month prolonged abstinence rates. Patient navigation programs have been shown to be effective. Patient navigator model has been well studied and implemented by the American Cancer Society. For example, an intervention delivered by peer health advocates was able to increase utilization of treatment programs and smoking abstinence among public housing residents. Mobile health (mhealth) strategies, such as automated text messaging or short message services (SMS) programs and social media based (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) smoking cessation interventions are effective in promoting quit outcomes.
