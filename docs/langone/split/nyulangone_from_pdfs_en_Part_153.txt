Crisis health aides are selected on thebasis of an application, a short autobiographicalsketch, and a screening interview.Allcandidates participate in a series of four to sixtraining sessions.Crisis health aides are paidmembers of the Health Center staff under thedirect supervision of mental health staffmembers.

Neighborhood mothers recruited asvolunteers participated in an intensive trainingprogram offered by a public health nurse, andworked with her to develop a mission statementand accompanying brochures about communityresources for pregnant women. During thesecond year of the program, the number ofvolunteers, all of whom were Hispanic andlived in the neighborhood, increased to 20.Volunteer mothers sought out and referredpregnant women to community agencies,including neighborhood clinics, food assistanceprograms, and social services. They alsoconducted outreach efforts, accompanied105Maternal and Child Healthpregnant women to clinic appointments, andvisited the mothers after they had given birth.In return, community citizens and agencypersonnel identified pregnant women in need ofthe program and referred them to a volunteermother. At the end of the second year, a 3 yeargrant enabled the volunteer mothers to open theDe Madres a Madres Center, which was staffedby public health nurses and a volunteer whoserved as center manager. Programs launchedat the center included training in leadershipskills, computers, public speaking, and grantwriting.In addition, the De Madres a MadresCenter was purchased by the volunteer mothers.During the fifth year, the volunteer mothers andlay staff assisted 8,440 persons, a 34 percentincrease over the previous year. During thesixth year, additional programs were begun forpregnant adolescents and abused women. Themothers began year 7 (1995) with an operatingbudget of $100,000, 6 staff members, and 60volunteers. Since the beginning of the programin 1989, no low birthweight infants have beenborn to women who worked with a volunteermother. The number of pregnant womenfollowed by volunteer mothers increased from59 in 1991 to 221 in 1993. The authorsconclude that at least 5 years is needed toinitiate, develop, and sustain a community based model for primary care. The involvementand leadership of community residents from thebeginning of the program and continuousvalidation with the community are required,along with local money to ensure localownership.

Indigenousvolunteer mothers received training inproviding information to increase access tohealth care. Volunteer mothers met and greetedpregnant women and asked about theirpregnancy and offered community resourceinformation and a follow up phone call or homevisit. Volunteer mothers also offeredinformation at local stores and banks. By theend of the second year of the program, thevolunteer corps grew to 30 mothers, with morethan 3,000 women receiving information. Inthe third year, the program rented a home andhired two community health nurses.In thefourth year, the volunteer mothers formed acoalition with the local health department andother organizations.In the fifth year, theprogram hired two paid mothers to coordinateoutreach and facilitate leadership development.Outcome data have identified the covertfunctions of the program to be the enhancement106Maternal and Child Healthof community self esteem, power, andeconomy.1 table, 17 references.

The control group received routinematernity and pediatric care, including socialand nutrition services, occasional home visitsby public health nurses, and delivery at theuniversity hospital. Treatment group1 receivedthe same routine services as the control group107Maternal and Child Healthplus weekly home visits. Treatment group 2received routine services, weekly home visits,and invitations to biweekly parent groups thatfostered supportive social interactions amongmothers. Home visitors were mothers selectedfor warmth, empathy, and interest in helpingpeople, with educational levels similar to thoseof their clients. They received 30 hours ofinitial training on pregnancy, birth, infant care,safety, nutrition, child development, communityresources, and family life. Home visitorsdeveloped trusting relationships with clientsand focused on emotional support, concretehelp, information, and enhancing informal andformal social networks. Researchers usedbirthweight and gestational age to describepregnancy outcome.

European home healthvisiting services differ in many ways with theservices of those programs in the United States.Most notably, the programs are largelyuniversal, (e.g., the services are offered to allfamilies). They have existed in Europe formore than a century and are a well acceptedpart of life that is integrated into broadgovernment funded health and social services.The programs are popular, generouslysupported, and viewed as effective.Specialattention in this article is given to describinghome visiting programs in Great Britain(England, Scotland, and Wales) and Denmark.Each of the countries believes that home healthvisiting programs are one piece of an essentialnetwork of economic and social supportsprovided by the government to families.Achievement of child health goals requires notonly health services, but also cash and noncashbenefits, housing supports, child care services,and social services as needed by the family.Ineach of the countries researched, home visitingprograms are voluntary, free, and not income tested. They are carried out by professionals,usually registered nurses, who visit homesfollowing the birth of a child. They providehealth education, preventive care, and socialsupport services to very young children andtheir parents. The services are supplemented bymore comprehensive health services available112Maternal and Child Healthto children through a system of maternal andchild health clinics or private doctors under auniversal health insurance system. Europeanhome health visiting programs differ in manyways including (1) whether special focus isgiven to specially identified families, (2)whether a family is visited after the birth oftheir first child only, (3) whether visits beginprenatally, (4) whether the visits aresupplemented with center based support groupsand care, and (5) the frequency of the visits.The services described contrast greatly with theservices of those programs in the United States.The authors address a pointed question: Couldthis be replicated in the United States? Theyconclude that a truly effective home healthvisiting program could not be possible withouta comprehensive maternal and child healthdelivery system and national health insurance.The United States lacks such an infrastructure.The authors also suggest that the United Stateshas little experience with universal programs, akey characteristic of European programs andcentral to their success.12 references.(HE9700604)160Home Visitation for Pregnant Women andParents of Young Children.Form:Journal article.Author:Olds, D.L.Source: American Journal of Diseases ofChildren.146(6):704 708, June 1992.Abstract: A researcher synthesized researchon home visitation for pregnant women andparents of young children and examined currentlegislative initiatives in light of that research.The design and results of a randomized trial ofprenatal and infancy home visitation by nursescarried out in Elmira, New York were reviewed.Evidence from other randomized trials was alsoexamined and analyzed in relation to theproposals of major advisory groups and currentlegislative initiatives. The Elmira studyinvolved 400 women who were having theirfirst child and were at risk for poor pregnancyand health outcomes because they were poor,unmarried, or teenagers.Results of the studyshowed that home visitation participants hadmore improved outcomes than the
