by NYU Langone Health, is conducted in collaboration with community leaders and organizations serving immigrant populations. A key strategy involves engaging bilingual volunteers and staff fluent in the native languages prevalent in target communities to facilitate communication and participation. 

Community engagement is vital for reaching families who may be unaware of available services or face barriers to accessing traditional healthcare settings due to language and cultural differences. By using trusted community partners and settings, the program hopes to reduce these barriers and build trust, ensuring children at risk for hearing loss are screened early.

### Addressing Early Intervention Needs

Early intervention is crucial for children with hearing loss to support language and cognitive development. The program aims to identify children in need of further evaluation and, if necessary, offer referrals for audiologic assessments and interventions, including hearing aids or cochlear implants, depending on the type and severity of the hearing loss.

### Creating Sustainable Programs

Ultimately, the long-term goal is to establish sustainable, community-based hearing screening programs. Lessons learned from the pilot will inform strategies for scaling the program to other underserved communities, potentially creating a model that could be replicated in other parts of the country or with other minority groups.

### Early Success and Future Steps

Initial success in piloting the program has shown a measurable increase in hearing screenings and follow-up interventions within the target communities. Data collected on the prevalence of hearing loss and the outcomes of early intervention will contribute to a broader understanding of hearing needs in immigrant populations.

The next steps include expanding partnerships with local schools and educators to provide comprehensive support for children diagnosed with hearing loss, ensuring they receive the help needed to succeed academically and socially. 

### Conclusion

By bringing hearing screenings to neighborhoods where families live, the program represents an innovative, community-centered approach to healthcare access and delivery, effectively marrying clinical research with public health outreach to address a critical gap in pediatric audiology care.

ventricle physiology—and similar life trajectories to each other. Such connections could foster support networks and a sense of shared experience, potentially alleviating some of the isolation and anxiety they face.

“In talking to our patients, we’ve learned that creating communities where they know other people who understand without explanation is incredibly valuable,” Dr. Halpern says.

To this end, the ACHD team plans to set up virtual meetings and social events, thereby allowing young adults to engage with peers who have similar conditions. By fostering these connections, the program hopes to strengthen patient engagement and improve overall quality of care.

Additionally, Dr. Halpern emphasizes the importance of allowing patients to express their preferences and concerns regarding their care. This patient-centered approach ensures that treatment plans are aligned with individual goals and lifestyles, further enhancing the quality of life for young adults living with congenital heart disease.

Ultimately, these initiatives demonstrate the program's commitment to addressing not only the physical health needs of ACHD patients but their social and emotional well-being as well, ensuring truly comprehensive care.

Our pediatric cardiac ICU is a leader. Cardiothoracic surgeons like Dr. Ralph S. Mosca are performing innovative procedures that enhance survival and quality of life for children with complex congenital heart conditions.

## Pediatric Cardiology & Cardiac Surgery

- **Multidisciplinary Approach:** Teamwork across specialities enhances outcomes for complex congenital heart conditions.
- **Innovative Procedures:** Surgeons like Dr. Ralph S. Mosca leverage advanced techniques to improve pediatric cardiac care.

The key to our success is ensuring that everything we do continually sets the stage for a lifetime of health. As a progressive, forward-thinking children’s surgical program, we’re trying to impact lifetimes—decades and decades ahead. We’re putting all our chips down early in the game so these kids can go on and live healthy lives.
