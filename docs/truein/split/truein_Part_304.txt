As an employer, you must know the state employment laws to ensure compliance, create a fair workplace, and mitigate legal risks. This article offers an in-depth exploration of crucial Ohio PTO laws, including at-will employment and more. Recognizing these laws ensures legal compliance and promotes a healthy employer-employee relationship in Ohio’s evolving employment landscape. By understanding the essential requirements of the Ohio PTO laws, employers can navigate potential pitfalls, uphold legal obligations, and promote fairness and equity in the workplace.

Conclusion At-Will Employment Ohio is one of the several states in the United States that adheres to the doctrine of “at-will” employment. According to this doctrine, the employer or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason. When used correctly, the at-will doctrine forms an employment framework where employers and employees can end their working relationship as needed. However, there are notable exceptions to this doctrine, which are crucial for employers to understand. Contractual Exceptions: Ohio labor laws mandate that if an employment contract exists, either in written or implied form, stipulating the terms for termination, employers must adhere to these contractual obligations. This can include the conditions under which an employee can be terminated. Public Policy Exceptions: Employers in Ohio are prohibited from terminating an employee for reasons that violate public policy. This includes firing an employee for refusing to perform an illegal act, reporting illegal conduct, or exercising legal rights, such as filing workers’ compensation claims. Discrimination and Retaliation: Ohio laws are the same as the federal law that forms the basis for unjustified termination. No employer can terminate an employee based on discriminatory reasons, such as race, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. Additionally, they cannot terminate an employee as retaliation for engaging in protected activities, like filing discrimination complaints or participating in investigations. Right-to-Work Law Ohio recognizes the “right-to-work” law, which pertains to legislation concerning union membership and workers’ rights. The law prohibits employers from refusing candidates to work for their union or employee body membership. The law also states that employment cannot be contingent upon union membership or the payment of union fees. Immigration Verification In Ohio, as in the rest of the United States, immigration verification is critical to employment. Employers can only do additional verification if required for the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. It is a requirement for the verification of the identity and employment authorization of each employee. In Ohio, using E-Verify, an internet-based system that compares information from an employee’s I-9 form to data from U.S. government records, is not mandatory. Drug Testing Employers in Ohio have the right to implement drug testing policies independently. However, the state has no such requirement. While hiring employees, Ohio law does not prohibit drug testing in the workplace. However, contractors working on public projects or government assignments should do mandatory drug testing for all employees per the Ohio Rev. Code § 153.03(B) . The same requirement applies to ambulance driving staff. Jury Duty Leave Ohio PTO laws require employers to provide unpaid time off for jury duty. Employers in Ohio are obligated to provide employees with time off to serve on a jury without penalizing them for their absence. This includes ensuring employees are not subject to adverse employment actions, such as termination or demotion, due to their jury duty service. Voting Leave Voting leave in Ohio is a mandatory time off. Employees can take a reasonable amount of time off work to vote. The amount of time considered “reasonable” can depend on various factors, including the distance from the voting location and the employee’s work schedule. As an employer in Ohio, you are obligated to provide voting leave. You cannot penalize employees for taking time off to vote. Else may face legal challenges and penalties. Employers are encouraged to communicate their voting leave policies clearly to their employees, ensuring that all parties understand their rights and obligations. Military Family Leave the law, eligible employees with up to 10 days or 80 hours of unpaid leave per year when a spouse, parent, or child is called to active duty or is on leave from active duty. It is applied to all employers with 50 or more employees. However, to be eligible for military family leave, an individual must satisfy these conditions: They are employed with an employer with 50 or more employees and have worked for the employer for at least 12 months and at least 1,250 hours during the preceding 12 months. The employee must have a spouse, parent, or child serving in the armed forces, including the National Guard or Reserves, who is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty. The employee must provide 14 days’ notice of intended leave to qualify for military family leave. Military family leave cannot be taken for more than two weeks before the deployment or one week after the deployment. Crime Victim Leave Ohio does not state the permissible leave for a crime victim. Still, employers must allow such employees to participate (at the prosecutor’s request) in preparation for a criminal or delinquency proceeding, to attend a criminal or delinquency proceeding if the employee’s attendance is reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the victim, or to attend a criminal or delinquency proceeding if the employee’s attendance is under their constitutional and statutory rights. Ohio recognizes the importance of supporting employees who are crime victims or who need to represent family members in criminal proceedings. Employers in Ohio must allow employees reasonable time off to attend court proceedings related to a crime in which the employee or a family member is a victim. The eligible employees include crime victims, family members of the victims, or representatives. Ohio allows employees to participate in criminal proceedings, such as hearings or trials, without fear of job loss or retaliation from their employer. Parental Leave Under the Ohio Civil Rights Act, it’s unlawful for employers to discriminate against employees based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. For pregnancy or related conditions, eligible female employees should be provided up to 6 weeks off (four weeks paid and two weeks unpaid). The Act required employers to provide reasonable accommodations and not impose undue hardship on such employees. However, the duration of leave should be determined based on the employee’s individual needs, and the employer should engage in a flexible and understanding approach to these needs. Full-time and part-time employees who work at least 30 hours a week are eligible for parental leave. Smoking Laws Ohio has workplace smoking regulations prohibiting smoking within offline premises, enclosed areas, and just adjacent to the entry and exit of the workplace building. Additionally, employers should put up “No Smoking” signage to inform employees and visitors of smoking restrictions. Employers must comply with these regulations to ensure a smoke-free workplace environment. Break Time to Express Milk Ohio PTO laws do not require employers to provide nursing mothers breaks to express breast milk. However, the federal Fair Labor Standards Act requires that Ohio employers provide a private space for nursing mothers to express breast milk. Meal Breaks Employers in Ohio are not mandated to provide meal or rest breaks for employees; however, per the Ohio Rev. Code § 4109.07(C) regulation, all employees under 18 must be provided at least 30 30-minute breaks when working over five consecutive hours. Minimum Wage, Overtime, and Wage Recordkeeping Ohio has a greater than the federal minimum wage rate. Ohio’s minimum wage rate is $10.10 per hour for hourly workers. For tipped workers, the minimum wage can be up to $5.05 per hour, provided they earn enough tips that make up the minimum wage requirement. Ohio overtime laws align with federal standards, requiring all employers to pay employees 1.5 times the regular wage rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. This overtime requirement doesn’t apply to agricultural workers. Employers must also maintain accurate wage records for up to three years for inspection by the Ohio Department of Commerce director if asked for. Final Payments Ohio labor law stipulates that employers must regularly pay their employees bi-weekly. Payment should be made on or before the first day of each month for work done during the first half of the previous month. The payment for the other half should be made on or before the 15th of each month. This ensures that employees receive timely compensation for their work. Unemployment Insurance Ohio’s unemployment insurance program benefits eligible individuals who have lost their jobs through no fault. Employers should look for the requirement and their contributions towards unemployment insurance for employees based on Ohio’s Department of Job and Family Services requirements. Workers' Compensation Workers’ compensation provides vital protections for both employees and employers in the event of a work-related injury or illness. Under the Ohio Workers’ Compensation Act, all non-self-insured employers must pay insurance premiums to the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation (BWC). Employers who attain self-insured status are exempted from this requirement. Child Labor Ohio labor law prohibits employment of kids under the age of 13, except in limited situations. Minors aged 14 and 15 can work in a broader range of jobs but are subject to strict limitations on their work hours, particularly during school hours. For 16 and 17-year-olds, while most jobs are permissible, there are still prohibitions on working in specific hazardous roles. Gun Laws Public and private employers in Ohio cannot prohibit employees with concealed handgun license (CHL) holders from storing their firearms within their private vehicles. Employers can prohibit employees from bringing firearms into the workplace, including in private offices and company-owned vehicles. However, the law allows employees to store firearms in their cars, even if parked on company property. Additional Laws and Regulations Prohibitions Against Pay Discrimination The Ohio Equal Pay Law (EPL) prohibits wage discrimination based on gender, age, race, color, religion, national origin, or ancestry. Employers must provide equal pay for equal work, regardless of an employee’s mentioned characteristics. Medical Marijuana Policies Ohio is one of the states in the U.S. that legalized medical marijuana. However, it does not require employers to accommodate medical marijuana use in the workplace. Employers have the right to enforce drug-free workplace policies and to prohibit employees from the use, possession, or distribution of medical marijuana at the workplace. Past Compensation Inquiries Employers in Columbus, Toledo, and Cincinnati cannot ask prospective employees about past compensation. Violation of the rule can result in civil fines of up to $5,000.

North Carolina overtime law is one such regulation that outlines the requirements and exceptions regarding overtime pay, employee classification, work hours, and more. You must be aware of North Carolina overtime law requirements as part of your compliance policies. This guide provides: A comprehensive overview of these laws Clarifying eligible hours worked Overtime eligibility and calculation methods Specific rules and exceptions The processes for filing wage complaints Table of Contents Maximum/Minimum Hours Worked Overtime Pay and Hours Worked Employee Classification and Pay Requirement for Non-Exempt Employees to Receive Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Exemptions for Salary Payment Criteria for Exemption from Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Requirements Breaks and Rest Periods Lack of Mandatory Rest Breaks or Meal Breaks for Most Employees Exceptions for Youths Under 16 Years Old Employer Obligations Regarding Break Provisions Minimum Scheduled Hours Overtime Eligibility Overtime Calculation Methods Calculation of overtime pay for hourly employees Considerations for Hourly Employees with Bonuses/Commissions Calculation of overtime pay for salaried employees Specific Rules and Exceptions Eligibility for Overtime Pay for Most Employees Exceptions for Exempt Categories and Seasonal Employees Government Employees’ Entitlement to Compensatory Time Off Statute of Limitations for Collecting Unpaid Overtime Filing Wage Complaints Process for Employees to File Complaints with Relevant Authorities Options for Filing Complaints Overtime for Salaried Employees How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion Maximum/Minimum Hours Worked In North Carolina, state-specific restrictions now limit how many hours employees older than 18 can work per day or week. As long as the employer is compensating accordingly, they can have significant flexibility in their scheduling. Lack of State or Federal Limitations on Hours Worked Per Day or Week Neither the state of North Carolina nor federal law sets a maximum number of hours worked per day or week for adult employees. The only requirement is fair compensation to eligible employees. It is the same for large corporations and smaller businesses. Such lack of a limitation allows firms to operate with considerable freedom in managing work schedules. Employer Discretion in Adjusting Employee Schedules North Carolina labor laws allow employers to alter employee work schedules as needed legally. They have sole discretion to make changes, including mandating overtime work. However, the requirement for fair compensation remains, and employers must follow all the legal requirements for overtime pay. Employers are not required to pay hourly and non-exempt employees for minimum numbers of hours. They should pay only for the hours worked. Overtime Pay and Hours Worked There is no state overtime law in North Carolina, and the state follows the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines on overtime pay . Requirement of Overtime Pay for Non-Exempt Employees According to the FLSA, all non-exempt employees in North Carolina are eligible for overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The overtime rate is one and a half times the employee’s regular pay rate. Discretion of Employers in Mandating Overtime Work Employers in North Carolina can require employees to work overtime as per their requirements. Employees cannot refuse to work overtime shifts. Also, employers have the discretion to change schedules at any time. However, they must compensate the employees at the overtime rate for any hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. Consequences of Refusal to Work Overtime Mandatory overtime is legal in North Carolina. If an employee refuses to work overtime, they can face consequences that can include disciplinary action or even termination. The law allows employers to set work hour requirements as part of the job’s expectations. Employee Classification and Pay In North Carolina, employee classification largely determines minimum wage and overtime pay eligibility. That is why accurate employee classification is mandatory, and any mistake can result in fines and legal action. Requirement for Non-Exempt Employees to Receive Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Generally, all hourly employees are non-exempt under the North California overtime law. Employees must have worked over 40 hours within a work week to be eligible for overtime. Employers are required to pay all employees at least the minimum wage rate of $7.25 per hour. Additionally, the overtime pay rate in North Carolina is 1.5 times the regular pay rate. This minimum wage rate can be lower for tipped employees, provided they consistently get at least $30 commission per week. Exemptions for Salary Payment Specific categories of salaried employees are exempt from overtime payment. In North Carolina, the following categories of salaried employees are exempt: Executives Administrators Season workers Skilled professionals Computer employees who earn $684 per week Outside sales employees Minors There can be other categories, too, and employers must refer to FLSA guidelines to decide who can be exempt from overtime requirements, depending on their duties and salary levels. Criteria for Exemption from Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Requirements Tipped employees and minors are exempted from the minimum wage requirement. As per the FLSA guidelines, as of 2024, tipped employees can be paid a lower than minimum wage rate if their commissions make up for the difference. North Carolina overtime law also allows minors (under 18) to be paid lower than minimum wage. However, in both cases, employers must consider the regular pay rate, not the adjusted wage rate, while calculating the overtime pay. Breaks and Rest Periods Lack of Mandatory Rest Breaks or Meal Breaks for Most Employees North Carolina labor laws do not require employers to provide most employees rest or meal breaks. This policy applies to the adult workforce, allowing employers to determine their break policies. Most employers provide appropriate break time for employees for a more productive workforce and a healthy work environment. Exceptions for Youths Under 16 Years Old For employees under the age of 16, North Carolina requires employees to provide a break of 30 minutes after any period of five consecutive hours of work. Employer Obligations Regarding Break Provisions While not mandatory, employers must follow the federal guidelines if they provide breaks. All short breaks (less than 20 minutes) are generally considered compensable work time, while breaks 30 minutes or longer are unpaid. Minimum Scheduled Hours Obligation of employers to pay employees for actual hours worked In North Carolina, employees have no obligation towards employees to pay for minimum scheduled hours unless they are salaried employees. All hourly employees should be paid for the actual hours worked without obligation for minimum scheduled hours. Furthermore, no state or federal law restricts the maximum number of hours an adult employee can work. Exceptions regarding promised minimum wage payments or benefits The exception is if the employee makes a wage payment agreement with an employee for a certain minimum number of hours. However, giving or not giving the promised wage benefits is entirely up to the employer. There are no state or federal guidelines, and the policies are at the employer’s discretion. Wage benefits can include vacation time, paid sick days, and holiday pay. And if the employer promises such wage benefits, then as per the N.C.G.S. 95-25.13(2) , the employer must: “Make available to its employees, in writing or through a posted notice maintained in a place accessible to its employees, employment practices and policies about promised wages. Overtime Eligibility Generally, non-exempt employees in North Carolina are entitled to overtime pay for hours over 40 in a workweek. It includes most hourly and salaried workers who do not fall into exempt categories (check Exemptions for Salary Payment above). Exemptions for Certain Types of Employees Professional employees, managers, and specific administrative staff may be exempt from overtime pay if they meet specific criteria under the FLSA. This includes: All bona fide professionals who earn not less than $684 per week All highly compensated employees making more than $107,432 a year Computer employees earning at least $27.63 per hour North Carolina’s overtime laws are guided by the FLSA, with additional state-specific regulations where applicable. Overtime Calculation Methods In North Carolina, employers must choose the overtime calculation method based on the type of employee. Calculation of overtime pay for hourly employees Most hourly employees are paid 1.5 times their regular wage rate for overtime hours. Say an employee earns $20/hour. Overtime rate = 1.5 x regular rate. If they work 45 hours a week, the overtime pay for 5 hours is calculated as 5 hours x ($20 x 1.5) = $150. Considerations for Hourly Employees with Bonuses/Commissions The overtime rate of such employees is calculated considering their commissions based on this formula: {((Total hours x Hourly Rate) + Commission) / Total hours} / 2 Assume the same employee as above earns a $100 commission that week. The regular rate becomes ($900 regular pay + $100 commission) / 45 hours = $22.22/hour. The overtime rate is 1.5 x ($22.22/2) = $16.66/hour. Thus, overtime pay = 5 hours x $16.66 = $83.3. Calculation of overtime pay for salaried employees If a salaried employee is non-exempt, they are paid overtime at an FLSA rate of 1.5 times the regular wage rate. For instance, if a salaried employee earns $800/week for a 40-hour workweek, their hourly rate is $800 / 40 = $20/hour. For overtime hours, pay 1.5 x $20. If they work 45 hours, the overtime pay for 5 hours is 5 hours x ($20 x 1.5) = $150. Specific Rules and Exceptions Eligibility for Overtime Pay for Most Employees Most employees in North Carolina are eligible for overtime pay, except those who fall into exempt categories as defined by the FLSA. Exceptions for Exempt Categories and Seasonal Employees Under the North Carolina and federal overtime laws, certain employees, such as executives, professionals, and seasonal workers, may be exempt from overtime pay requirements. However, seasonal employees working for establishments that operate more than seven months a year are eligible for overtime. Exempt category employees earning less than $685 weekly can also be eligible for overtime. Government Employees’ Entitlement to Compensatory Time Off Government employers have the option to offer compensatory time off to employees as an alternative to overtime compensation. However, only public sector employers are eligible for compensatory time off, not private employers. Statute of Limitations for Collecting Unpaid Overtime Under the FLSA, employees can claim unpaid overtime within two years from the violation date. However, if the employer is a wilful violator, this limitation can be extended for three years. Filing Wage Complaints Process for Employees to File Complaints with Relevant Authorities In North Carolina, employees can file a complaint under both the federal and state overtime laws at the same time. Employees can file complaints with the State Department of Labor or the U.S. Department of Labor if they believe their overtime rights have been violated. Options for Filing Complaints Complaints can be filed with the North Carolina Department of Labor or the United States Department of Labor, depending on the nature of the violation. Overtime for Salaried Employees Employers in North Carolina should not consider all salaried employees exempt; there are conditions under which salaried employees are eligible for overtime. Conditions under which salaried employees may receive overtime pay A salaried employee who is not in one of the categories, administrators, managers, skilled employees, or supervisors employed solely to supervise other employees – and makes less than $455 is eligible for overtime.
