Home Truein Help and Support Employee Setup, Onboarding What kind of roles are available to assign to my staff ? What kind of roles are available to assign to my staff ? Truein provides out-of-the-box roles like Staff, L2 Admin, L3 Admin, Admin, and Global Admin as well as hierarchy roles like Manager, Department head, and Contractor Supervisor. You can refer to the roles section to check for the access available for each role. In addition, for enterprise customers, Custom Roles can be set up on a request basis, the admin should request the Truein support team to set up custom roles. Global Admin is the highest role while Staff is the lowest access role. The recommendation is to assign a Staff role by default to all staff/employees while users with admin access should be assigned an Admin role. The global admin should be someone who requires subscription access and is the main point of contact for the account. How to assign roles to your staff? Roles of the users can be assigned one by one from Staff Directory ->  Access ->  Roles or via bulk upload Excel sheet roles can be assigned for new staff. Currently, roles cannot be updated for existing staff in bulk, to update roles for existing staff you need to do it one by one from the staff directory. Where can I view different role details? To view the various roles and the features they have access to, you can select ‘View Roles’ in the Staff Directory on the Web Dashboard. For example, Managers : They can view and manage their reporting staff’s attendance. Site Admin L2 role can view and manage the attendance of all the staff and can raise requests for regularization of all those staff members who need to be approved by the admin, view reports, and analytics. They have access to plan shifts and workforce plan activities. Admin L2 role cannot do the following: delete staff,  view or add policies, holidays, and jobs, cannot view system logs, and cannot view or edit any settings. So if this access is required, set the role as admin. Site Admin L3 role can view own attendance, – View Staff Time Clock, raise regularization request, view leave calendar, view staff details, view reports and analytics, has access to  plan shifts and workforce plan activities Admin : They have the complete view and edit rights for the entire organization. They cannot add,  delete, or edit any staff, cannot make approvals or rejections on any type of attendance regularization requests, view or add policies, holidays, or jobs, cannot view system logs, and cannot view or edit any settings. Site Report Viewer can view their own attendance, and have access to view timesheets,  download reports and view analytics. Also, they can Request Regularization for their own attendance. Report viewer cannot do any other activities like delete or edit any staff, cannot make approvals or rejection on any type of attendance regularization requests, view or add policies, holiday, or jobs, cannot view system logs, has no access to staff directory,  workforce planning and cannot view or edit any settings. If you have doubts about which role should I assign to my staff, please check the Role level access and decide accordingly. For e.g., if you want to grant Add staff access, select the role that has this access enabled or if you want to give all staff daily timesheet/attendance view access but no edit access then assign a role having View Staff access enabled but edit access disabled. To set hierarchy roles or access for Managers, Department heads, and Contract Supervisor do the following: – Manager-level access: Step 1: Select the staff to whom you want to give Manager-level access, go to the Access section, and enable the “User can be assigned as Manager/Department head” option. Step 2: Then assign him/her as manager for the required staff/employees. Now the manager will have access to view and approve timesheets or any other requests of their direct reportees only. Managers by default don’t have access to view staff details of the entire site/company. They will have access only to their direct reports after they are assigned to the managers. -Department-head level access: Step 1: Select the staff to whom you want to give Manager-level access, go to the Access section, and enable the “User can be assigned as Manager/Department head” option. Step 2: Go to Settings > Org Fields > Department and assign Department head. The department head will have access to view and approve timesheets or any other requests of the entire department. Department head by default doesn’t have access to view staff details of the entire site/company. They will have access only to their assigned department. -Contract Supervisor access: Step 1: Go to Settings > Contractor Agencies and select the required agency. Enable the option to create a Truein user for the Contract supervisor. Step 2: The contractor supervisor signs up in the Truein mobile/user app. Now the contractor supervisor will have access to view timesheets of all staff belonging to his agency only. To add non-attendance users like your management team or someone who only requires dashboard access but won’t do any clock-in/mark attendance you can add them as users from the Admin > Manage Staff Access section. Moreover, this user can be linked to the staff directory when similar details are added to the staff directory.
