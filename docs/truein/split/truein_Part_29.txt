The country is, however, diversifying its economy to move away from its reliance on oil reserves. In doing so, Oman is introducing amendments to its long-standing employment law to attract workforce from other countries. The Oman Labour Law (Royal Decree No. 35/2003) and its subsequent amendments govern Oman’s employment law. This guide explores the legal framework for employer-employee relationships in the Sultanate. We will also establish how the new labour law in Oman affects various aspects, including employment contracts, working hours, leave entitlements, termination procedures, and the rights and obligations of both employers and employees. Understanding Oman Labour Law is crucial for employers to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Given the diverse workforce available in Oman, fostering a positive employment environment and avoiding potential legal disputes will require knowledge of updates in 2024 for maintaining lawful and effective business operations.

Conclusion FAQs Q: What are the standard working hours in Oman? Q: What are the rules regarding overtime pay in Oman? Q: What are the provisions for maternity leave in Oman? Q: What should the employment contract include? Q: What are the regulations regarding discrimination in the workplace? Labour Laws in Oman Oman employment law sets out the general principles and regulations governing employment in the country. Every employer, irrespective of the state of their business license, must adhere to these labour laws. They cover various issues, including recruitment, employment contracts, working conditions, and termination. The key provisions of the new labour law in Oman include regulating working hours, wage payment, and employee benefits. The law aims to protect workers’ rights. It includes significant amendments to reduce work hours, paternal leave, leave carry-over, bereavement leave for non-Omani women, and collective labour agreements. The Labour Law stated new provisions which regulate the process for termination, aimed at making sure that there is an equitable process for employee and employer both. Also, the New Labour Law has increased the duration of some categories for leaves and even added new categories. Annual leave- 30 days per year Sick leave- 182 days per year Paternity leave- 7 days Maternity leave- 98 days Marriage- 3 days Death of family member- depending on the relation Hajj leave- 10-15 days Examination leave- 15 days Unpaid leave for childcare for women- 1 year Omanization Policy The Omanization policy is a national initiative aimed at increasing the employment of Omani nationals in the private sector. Under this policy, which took effect on April 1, 2024, all Omani companies owned by foreign investors must employ at least one Omani citizen within one year of their formation. Additionally, if companies fail to comply with the policy within a year, they will be provided a 30-day grace period, beyond which they will be subjected to fines. This policy is designed to reduce reliance on expatriate labour and promote the development of local talent. Strategies for Localising Workforce – The employer must share with the Ministry of Labour the annual strategies for localising the workforce. The data which includes specifics like count of Omani workers, gender diversity, job positions, and wage must be accessible within the workplace. Training and Leadership – The New Law states that every company must create a plan for choosing and training the Omani employees for the leadership positions and ensure that the plan is well implemented. Omanisation Promotion – The New Law also permits termination of non Omani employees when the termination reason is to replace them with some Omani national. Employment of Expatriates Oman has a high number of foreign workers. Currently, expatriates make up 42.26% of the total population , so employers must know the labour law in Oman for expatriates. Visa and Work Permits Before expats can be hired, employers must ensure they have the necessary visas and work permits from the Sultanate before they can commence employment. The visa and work permits have a thorough application process, including medical examinations and security clearances. Labour Laws for Expatriates Of all the emirates in the Middle East, Oman has the most straightforward labour laws for expats, as they are subject to the same labour laws as Omani nationals. However, additional regulations concerning their recruitment, employment contracts, and termination include visas, work permits, and medical history. The Labour Law 53/2023 ensures safety of expats through various articles. The employees are entitled to annual leaves with comprehensive pay of not less than 30 days, which he or she can take as per their requirements and they may not take leave before expiry of 6 months from date of joining with the employer.  Further, the employer may pay basic wage for days of annual leave that the worker did not take if he/she agrees in writing. The expats are also covered by Oman labour law for salary increments. It is good to see that the law appreciates the contribution of expat workers and ensures fair treatment. Expatriate Taxation Oman does not impose personal income tax on expatriates. Additionally, expats are exempted from social insurance contributions. However, they must pay Job Security Fund contributions. Recruiting Expatriate Talent Employers must ensure that the recruitment of expatriates aligns with the Omanization policy and obtain necessary clearances from the Ministry of Labour. The expat must have professional competence or technical skills or qualifications required by the Sultanate. Also, the employer has the permit to hire the expatriate and the latter must have entered the country in a legal manner. Expat must also satisfy the conditions set out in Foreign Residence Law i.e. valid passport, sponsorship, valid visa etc. Further, the expat employee is required to be medically free and fit of all chronic and contagious diseases mentioned by the Ministry of Health. Onboarding Expatriates Effective onboarding includes cultural orientation, ensuring legal compliance, and providing necessary training to integrate expatriates into the workforce smoothly. Cultural Integration Cultural integration programs help expatriates adapt to the local culture and workplace environment, fostering a harmonious working relationship. Employment Contracts for Expatriates The same rules of employment contracts apply to expatriates as for Omanis. They can have finite and infinite employment contracts that clearly outline the terms of employment, including job duties, salary, benefits, and termination conditions, and must comply with Omani labour laws. Social Insurance Law Effective January 1, 2024, the Omani government introduced a new social insurance law through royal decree No. 52/2023. As per the new law, employers must contribute towards insurance for: Old Age, Disability, and Death- The employee share is 7.5% and the employer share is 11% Work Injuries and Occupational Disease- there is only the employer share of 1% with maximum salary (OMR) of 3000 Employment Security- the employee and the employer have 0.5% both, making it a total of 1% Maternity Leaves (effective July 2024)- here the employer share is 1% Sick and Other Leaves (effective July 2025)- here too there is the employer share of 1% All these monthly contributions are calculated based on the number of working days in each month. Laws on Labour Unions Labour unions in Oman are permitted if the employer policies allow them. Employers and employees can participate in collective bargaining, dispute resolution, and worker rights advocacy. However, the law provides a framework for establishing and operating labour unions to protect and promote employees’ interests. Working Hours Previously, the standard working hours in Oman were 8.5 hours a day. Under the new amendments, this time is trimmed to 8 hours a day or 40 hours per week. During Ramadan, Muslim employees are entitled to reduced working hours of six hours per day or 30 hours per week. The Oman Labour Law 2003 says that the minimum employment age is 15 years while the minors from 15-18 years of age are not allowed to work between 6 pm to 6 am. New Rights for Employers The new Oman employment law provides some new rights to employers for improved management of a multicultural workforce. Here are new rights every employer in Oman must know: Recognition of Non-compete Clauses (Article 69) Article 69 recognizes the validity of non-compete clauses in employment contracts where the nature of an employee’s role puts him in a position to compete with the employer. However, the clauses must be reasonable in scope, duration, and geographic area and necessary to protect the employer’s legitimate business interests. Termination due to Redundancy (Article 43(4)) Employers can terminate employees due to redundancy, provided genuine business needs justify it. It can be due to a change of business operations, the closing of an establishment, or the need for a reduced number of staff. Reduction of Staff due to Economic Cause (Article 44) Economic conditions that necessitate a reduction in workforce upon approval by the Ministry of Labour can make ground for the reduction of staff. It is applicable if an employer suffers economic losses for no less than two consecutive years. Termination of Underperforming Staff (Article 43(3)) Employers can terminate employees for underperformance but must first provide a grace period of six months. The employer can terminate employment if the performance is not improved within the grace period. Definite Period Contracts (Article 34) The renewed contracts will remain definite period contracts if they do not exceed five years. Employers must specify the duration and conditions under which they can be renewed or terminated. Employer Obligations and Responsibilities As an employer, there are certain obligations that you are expected to fulfill under the revised Oman employment law: Work Permits and Fair Job Offers Employers ensure all employees have valid work permits and offer fair employment terms that comply with Omani labor laws. Employers must secure the appropriate work permits and visas for expatriate employees before they can legally work in Oman. Expatriate employees must undergo a medical examination to ensure they meet the health requirements set by the Omani authorities. Additional Employers must also provide fair and transparent job offers, ensuring that the offer clearly outlines the job role, responsibilities, and expectations. The offer should specify the salary, allowances, benefits, and other compensatory elements. Health and Safety Employers must provide a safe working environment, conduct regular safety training, and adhere to occupational health and safety regulations. Regular health inspections are conducted to identify and mitigate potential hazards. Non-Discrimination Discrimination based on gender, nationality, religion, or any other prohibited ground is strictly forbidden. Employers must promote equality and inclusivity in the workplace. Also, they must establish procedures to address and prevent harassment and bullying in the workplace. Social Security Employers must contribute to the social insurance schemes as discussed above. Ensuring employees are registered and covered under the social security system is also essential. Payment of Wages Wages must be paid on time and in full per the employment contract. According to Article 51 of the Oman Labour Law, monthly salaried employees must be paid regularly once a month. In case of piecemeal, weekly, or period exceeding two weeks: Payment for the first week of work must be made within one week of completion Payment of the remaining balance within one week of the job’s completion Deductions from Wages Deductions from wages are only permissible if mentioned in the employment contracts outlined by the Labour Law, such as for social insurance contributions or disciplinary fines. No deductions can be made without the consent of the employee. Penalties for Employers' Non-Compliance Non-compliance with labour laws can result in significant penalties, including fines, business license suspension, and legal action. In serious non-compliance, authorities can issue the suspension of services until the issues are resolved and full compliance is established. Confidentiality and Non-Compete Clauses Omani labour laws allow confidentiality and non-compete clauses in the employment contracts. Confidentiality clauses can be included to protect sensitive business information such as trade secrets and client information. Confidentiality Clause a. Clarity of clauses: Clearly define what constitutes confidential information. b. Reasonable Scope: Ensure the scope is reasonable in terms of duration and breadth because confidentiality clauses cannot restrict public knowledge. Non-Compete Clauses Non-compete clauses prevent employees from joining competitors or starting a competing business for a specified period. In Oman, non-compete clauses are more strictly implemented than confidentiality clauses. Employers can include non-compete clauses only if they demonstrate the need for a non-compete clause. Royal Decree on the Protection of Workers' Rights The Royal Decree on the Protection of Workers’ Rights enhances employee protections, including provisions for fair treatment, dispute resolution, and enforcement of labour rights. It underscores the government’s commitment to safeguarding worker welfare. Rest Period & Leave Policies Under the new labour law in Oman, the rest period and leaves are further improved. Here are the benefits offered: Annual Leave: Employees are entitled to at least 30 days of paid annual leave after six months of service. Bereavement Leave: Employees are granted bereavement leave for the death of close family members, typically ranging from 3 to 7 days.

Study Leave: 15 days for Omani employees to pursue further education. Public Holidays: It depends on the annual holiday calendar issued by the authorities. However, employees are entitled to paid leave on public holidays recognized in Oman, which include Islamic and national holidays. Sick Leave: The new labour law in Oman entitles employees to up to 182 days per year of sick leave with the following payment structure: Day 1 to Day 21 on full payment Day 22 to Day 35 on 75 percent payment Day 36 to Day 70 on 50 percent payment Day 71 to Day 182 on 35 percent payment Special Leave: Special leave provisions exist for events such as marriage, childbirth, and emergencies, as specified in the employment contract or company policy.
