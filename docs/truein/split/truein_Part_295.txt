Statutory Provisions Addressing Vacation Pay Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination Minnesota State Holidays in 2024 How does Truein help with paid time-off management? Conclusion What are Minnesota PTO Laws related to various kinds of leaves? Minnesota’s PTO laws are varied, depending on what type of leave employers want. There are specific laws and regulations related to various kinds of leaves, including sick, maternity, paternity, bereavement, jury duty, military, and voting leave. We take a closer look at each of these types of leaves. 1. Sick leave Minnesota follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Minnesota Earned Sick and Safe Leave law. Both these laws require employers to provide paid sick leave to their employees. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal labor law in the United States that provides eligible employees with certain job-protected leave entitlements for specific family and medical reasons. It does not apply to all employers but only applies to employers with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the worksite. However, public agencies, including local, state, and federal employers, are covered by the FMLA regardless of the number of employees. An employee must have worked with the current employer for at least 12 months to be eligible for sick leave under FMLA. Also, employees should have accumulated at least 1,250 service hours during the 12 months. The qualifying reasons for sick leave for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave are: For the employee’s serious health condition. To care for a spouse, child, or parent with a severe health condition. For the birth and care of a newborn child or the placement of a child through adoption or foster care. To address particular qualifying exigencies for individuals working in the military. For such people, sick leave can be up to 26 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave within 12 months. Under this law, employees accrue sick leave based on the hours worked. Employers with 21 or more employees must provide paid sick leave, while smaller employers must provide unpaid sick leave. This leave can be used for the employee’s illness, a family member’s illness, or safety-related reasons. Employers must comply with the specific requirements outlined in the law to ensure employees receive their entitled sick leave benefits. For more details, refer to Minnesota Paid Sick and Safe Leave. Minnesota Earned Sick and Safe Leave (ESSL) law allows employees to take up to 48 hours of paid sick leave per year. The new law applies to all private employers and was enacted on January 1, 2024. The allocated sick leave time can be used for any of the following reasons: Employee’s illness, injury, or other medical condition To care for a sick, injured, or suffering family member To recover from domestic abuse, etc. 2. Maternity, Paternity & FMLA Minnesota follows federal laws like the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). It includes certain protections and benefits for maternity and paternity leave. FMLA ensures eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child. It is applicable for both mothers and fathers who can use the leave to take care of the child or adjust to an adopted child. Minnesota employers are also subject to the Minnesota Pregnancy and Parental Leave Act. It also grants eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for pregnancy, child care, parental care, or other related medical needs. The eligibility for maternity and paternity leave under the Minnesota Pregnancy and Parental Leave Act is the same as for FMLA. Furthermore, employees must understand the specific company policies and requirements that apply to their situation. 3. Bereavement leave Minnesota has no specific state law requiring employers to provide bereavement leave. As an employer in the state, you are not obligated to offer time off for bereavement. However, many employers offer bereavement leave as part of their benefits package or employment policies. The availability and duration of bereavement leave are at the employer’s sole discretion. Also, employers should communicate these policies with their employees so they are aware of the company’s stance on bereavement leave. 4. Jury duty leave Minnesota law requires employers to provide unpaid leave for employees summoned to serve on a jury. Employers cannot penalize or retaliate against employees for fulfilling their civic duty by serving on a jury. The duration of jury duty leave can vary depending on the trial or jury service length. Minnesota law does not require employers to pay employees regular wages or salaries while serving on a jury. However, the court pays such employees $20.00 a day and reimbursement on mileage for travel. Upon completing their jury duty service, employees must be reinstated to their previous positions with the same terms and conditions of employment. Employers must treat employees returning from jury duty service as if they had been continuously employed during the leave period. 5. Military leave Military leave in Minnesota is governed by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). It provides certain rights and protections for employees who serve in the military or National Guard. Under the military leave, employees must provide advance notice to their employers when called to active duty or required to participate in military training or drills. Minnesota state law also provides additional security to employees under the military leave laws. This includes: Up to 4 years of unpaid leave to serve in the military to the members of the National Guard Up to 10 days of unpaid leave to an employee related to an individual in military who has been injured or killed in active duty. Up to 1 day of unpaid leave a year to an employee; an immediate family member of a member of the US armed forces. Minnesota employers with 20 or more employees at the exact location must grant unpaid leave to serve in the Civil Air Patrol. All employers in the state are generally required to grant leave for the duration of the military service and are prohibited from terminating or penalizing employees for fulfilling their military obligations. 6. Voting Leave Minnesota law allows employees who are eligible voters to take paid time off to vote in a state primary, general, or special election. It applies to all eligible voters, full-time and part-time employees and temporary workers. There are no specific rules for the time off, and the law requires employers to provide employees with “sufficient paid time” to vote during state elections. The time off may vary depending on the employee’s work schedule and the polling hours. Employers have discretion in determining when employees can take time off to vote. By Minnesota law, employers are prohibited from interfering with or penalizing employees for taking time off to vote. Retaliation or discrimination against employees exercising their voting leave rights is illegal. What happens to Accruals under Minnesota PTO law? No Minnesota PTO law mandates employers to provide their employees paid time off (PTO) or vacation accruals. Instead, the state allows employers to establish their PTO policies and determine whether and how employees accrue and use PTO. As an employer, you can establish an accrual system to decide the rate employees accrue PTO, such as a certain number of hours per pay period or based on years of service. It can also include the rules for using accrued PTO, including when employees can take time off and any restrictions or requirements for requesting PTO. If an employer decides to offer accruals in the benefits package, they should communicate the policies clearly in the employment contract or collective bargaining agreement that specifies PTO accruals and usage; both the employer and employee must adhere to the terms of the agreement. What happens to roll-over/carry-over time-off under Minnesota PTO law? Minnesota is one of the states that allow use-it-or-lose-it policy. Hence, employers are not required to provide the roll-over or carry-over of accrued paid time off (PTO) from one year to the next. It is at the discretion of employers to establish their policies regarding the treatment of unused PTO. Employers can set caps on the amount of PTO accrued or carried over. Capping the carry-over time off ensures that employees only accrue a few paid days, which can hinder business operations. Employers should ensure that their PTO policies are consistently applied to all employees and adhere to any applicable employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements. Statutory Provisions Addressing Vacation Pay In Minnesota, earned vacation pay is termed as wages. Employers must adhere to their established policy or employment contract if they offer vacation pay. This includes any stipulations regarding the accrual, use, and payment of vacation pay. If an employer’s policy states that vacation pay is earned, then under Minnesota law, it may be considered wages and could be due upon termination of employment. Employers should communicate their vacation pay policies to employees to avoid misunderstandings. Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination No Minnesota PTO payout laws require employers to offer the payment of accrued, unused vacation upon termination. Employers have the discretion to create policies and practices regarding the payment of accrued vacation time upon termination. Employers may have “use it or lose it” policies, which means that employees forfeit any accrued, unused vacation time if it is not taken before termination. If there is an employment contract, collective bargaining agreement, or individual agreement regarding payment of accrued PTO on termination, the employer and employee must adhere to the terms of that agreement. Employers should communicate their policies regarding the payment of accrued vacation upon termination to employees. Likewise, employees should review and understand their employer’s policy and consult HR or management for clarification.

And if such is explicitly in the employer’s policy, they must adhere to their policies. Does your Missouri state require employers to pay out PTO? Missouri PTO payout laws do not mandate employers to pay out accrued PTO upon an employee’s termination or resignation. Employers in the state have complete discretion to pay employees for any unused time off on their departure from the company. However, if an employer in Missouri offers these benefits, they should communicate the established policy or employment contract with the employees. And if such is explicitly in the employer’s policy, they must adhere to their policies. What are Missouri PTO Laws related to various kinds of leaves? 1. Sick leave Missouri has no state-specific sick leave law, and employers are not mandated to provide paid sick time to employees. However, all employers must follow federal law, i.e., the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). As there are no local state laws regarding sick leave, employers must pay attention to the criteria for FMLA requirements. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law allowing eligible employees with job-protected leave for specific family and medical reasons. The eligible employees are the ones who meet the following criteria: Working for an employer with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius for at least 20 workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Have worked for the current employer for at least 12 months. However, these months don’t have to be consecutive; an employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months. According to the FMLA leave policy, all eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during 12 months for specific family or medical reasons. The qualifying reasons to avail of sick leave under FMLA are: The birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child. Attending to the medical needs of a spouse, child, or parent with a severe health condition. A serious health condition affecting employees. Any qualifying exigency arising from a spouse, child, or parent’s active duty military service. 2. Maternity and paternity leave Missouri employees should receive leave for maternity and paternity needs under the FMLA. All employers in the state should provide eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for specific family or medical reasons. The same rules apply to the eligibility for maternity and paternity leave. Additionally, Missouri does not have particular maternity or paternity leave laws beyond FMLA requirements. Also, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is another federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against pregnant women in all areas of employment. No pregnant employee can be discriminated against regarding hiring, assignments, promotions, firing, etc. 3. Bereavement leave No Missouri PTO payout laws mandate employers to provide paid or unpaid bereavement leave. Individual company policies typically determine the availability of bereavement leave. Usually, most employers in the state offer two days of bereavement leave to affected employees. However, these bereavement leaves are unpaid and are not required to be paid at the time of termination. 4. Jury duty leave Employers in Missouri are legally required to grant employees leave for jury duty service. Both full-time and part-time employees are entitled to this leave when they receive a jury duty summons. The duration of jury duty leave can vary, depending on the specific requirements of the jury service. While Missouri law mandates that employers must grant employees leave for jury duty, it does not require employers to provide compensation for the time an employee spends on jury duty. However, people serving jury duty in Missouri are paid $6 a day and mileage reimbursement for travel. 5. Military leave In Missouri, military leave regulations are defined under the Revised Statutes of Missouri, Section 105.270 . According to this statute, “officers and employees of the state, or any department, agency, county, municipality, school district, or other political subdivision, as well as other public employees who are or may become members of the National Guard or any reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States, are entitled to leave of absence from their duties.” Employers are obligated to provide military leave to employees without loss of time, pay, regular leave, or any other rights or benefits for periods of military service. All employers should follow the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which protects job rights for individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily leave employment positions to undertake military service. It ensures that no individual is: 1. At a disadvantage in their civilian careers because of their military service. 2. Faces any challenges with their re-employed in their civilian jobs upon return from duty. 3. Is met with discrimination against by employers because of past, present, or future military service. 6. Voting leave Like all other states, Missouri mandates that employers provide voting leave to employees. Employers must grant up to 3 hours of paid leave for employees to vote to participate in the electoral process. All registered voters are covered under the voting leave policy. However, if an employee already has 3 continuous hours of off-duty before the polls, the employer is not obligated to provide additional time off specifically for voting. Also, employees must request this leave in advance, specifically before the election day. Employers are prohibited from penalizing or discriminating against employees who exercise their right to vote. What happens to Accrual under Missouri PTO payout laws? Under Missouri PTO payout laws, no employer is obligated to pay for unused paid time off. The state allows a “use it or lose it” policy, allowing employers to establish their PTO accrual and payout policies. As an employer in Missouri, you have the flexibility to determine how PTO accrues, whether it carries over from year to year, and if it can be cashed out upon departure. However, all employers must communicate their PTO policies with all their employees through contracts, employee handbooks, and company websites. What happens to rollover/carry-over time-off under Missouri PTO payout laws? There are no PTO laws in Missouri on the rollover of unused leaves. The state allows “use it or lose it,” so employers are not mandated to carry over or roll over unused PTO from one year to the next. All companies have the discretion to establish their policies regarding the carry-over of accrued PTO. Although employees may forfeit any unused PTO, most companies offer carry-over unused time off at the end of the year to attract and retain employees. All the policies regarding PTO carry-over must be communicated to employees to avoid any misunderstandings or disputes. What happens to unused vacation time under Missouri PTO payout laws? Missouri PTO payout laws do not mandate employers to pay out unused vacation time upon an employee’s termination. Employers can choose whether or not to compensate employees for their accrued but unused vacation time. This flexibility allows you to establish policies that align with their business objectives while remaining compliant with state law. Employers need to have clearly defined policies regarding unused vacation time to prevent confusion and ensure fair treatment of employees. Am I liable to pay vacation paid time-off if the employee is laid off? Employers in Missouri are not liable to pay vacation paid time-off if they lay off employees. As no Missouri PTO payout laws exist, employers are not obligated to pay employees irrespective of how they are laid off. The decision to provide compensation for unused vacation time when an employee is laid off is at the employer’s discretion. The information should be clearly outlined in the company’s policies. Employers can determine whether they will offer their employees this benefit. Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination Missouri employers may pay out accrued, unused vacation time to employees upon termination as part of their company policies. Employers are not obligated to have final wages, including vacation on termination. Employers can legally prohibit employees from getting paid for vacation leave by creating policies they can sign as part of the contract. If you opt to provide this benefit, you should communicate the terms and conditions surrounding the payment of accrued, unused vacation time to avoid any ambiguity or disputes with their employees. Missouri State Holidays 2024 As an employer in Missouri, you must be aware of the state holidays, as these may impact employee schedules and expectations for time off. The usual state holidays in Missouri include New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. Here is a complete Missouri State Holiday 2024 calendar for employers to plan accordingly to accommodate employees’ time-off requests during these holidays and ensure smooth operations. Please note that private employers are not mandated to provide holiday leave to employees, and it depends on their company policies. Also, the holidays that fall on a Saturday are observed on Friday, and holidays that fall on a Sunday are observed on Monday.
