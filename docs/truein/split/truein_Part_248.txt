How To Calculate Labor Cost In Manufacturing? May 15, 2024 Running a manufacturing company successfully largely depends on how you manage the workforce. Labor is the most critical resource in a company, and HR managers must ensure that workers are managed efficiently. To be profitable, manufacturing companies are required to keep labor costs low. Unfortunately, many managers need to know how to calculate manufacturing labor costs. It is an important metric, and companies must analyze it for profit and loss. If you want your organization to handle poor efficiency and overspending, it’s essential to know how to calculate labor costs. In this article, we will explain how labor costs are calculated in manufacturing. Table of Contents What is the labor cost in manufacturing? What's the difference between direct and indirect costs? Direct costs Indirect costs How to calculate manufacturing labor costs 1. Calculate the hourly labor rate 2. Calculate labor hours 3. Calculate labor cost per unit How to reduce manufacturing labor costs 1. Track employee work hours 2. Keep overtime to a minimum 3. Train your staff Conclusion What is the labor cost in manufacturing? The labor cost in manufacturing is the total amount spend on workers by the company. It includes not only wages but also contract workers’ costs, taxes of labor costs, bonuses, and other costs such as employee compensation schemes. A company has to bear many costs apart from salaries, such as overtime, maternity pay, sick pay, and investments in training costs. The overall labor cost is much more than the basic employee salaries, so it is essential to keep track of the overall labor costs in manufacturing. It is necessary for smaller businesses where labor costs can make up a large percentage of the overall business operations costs. What's the difference between direct and indirect costs? To calculate the labor cost in manufacturing, you must understand the direct and indirect costs. Direct costs Direct costs are the expenses associated with the specific object that is directly used in the production of the product in the company. For instance, the raw materials and tools used for manufacturing the products are direct costs. If the employee is directly working with the raw materials or the tools in the manufacturing unit, then their salary is a direct labor cost. For instance, in a juice-making factory, the workers who control the ingredient mixing machines are direct laborers. Usually, the salaries of engineers, production supervisors, assembly line workers, and truck drivers are direct labor costs. You must know how to calculate direct manufacturing labor costs to reduce production costs. Indirect costs Indirect labor costs are expenses not directly associated with a specific product or tool used for manufacturing products at the company. A typical example of indirect cost is administrative expenses. The indirect labor costs are the salaries a manufacturing company pays to payroll staff, administrative assistants, sales team members, and office managers. These costs are indirect because they are not directly linked to the products you manufacture but are part of the company’s overhead and relate to the entire business. Indirect costs also include rent, depreciation, insurance, and quality control. But you must recognize that these costs are unnecessary if they don’t directly contribute to the manufacturing process. Such expenses are required to ensure the business runs successfully. Any opportunity costs are also considered indirect. It is the money that your company loses because of performance issues. How to calculate manufacturing labor costs Now that you understand the direct and indirect labor costs, here’s how to calculate labor costs in manufacturing. There are three significant aspects. 1. Calculate the hourly labor rate Calculating the direct hourly labor rate is the sum of all the wages, taxes, and other cost benefits for a given period divided by the number of work hours for that given period. The hourly labor rate is calculated as follows: Wages + taxes + other benefits / Number of hours worked during the pay period 2. Calculate labor hours It is the calculation of the labor hours put into producing one unit of your product. It is one of the essential metrics to calculate the labor cost in manufacturing. Divide the number of units produced by the labor hours required to make the units. The formula for labor hours is: Units produced / labor hours needed to make the units 3. Calculate labor cost per unit The labor cost per unit is the multiplication of the hourly labor rate by the labor hours per unit. Once you have calculated the hourly labor rate and labor hours, you can calculate labor cost per unit as: Labor hourly rate x labor hours The final labor cost per unit will help you establish how much portion of the overall expenditure is attributed to the labor cost in manufacturing. Based on the outcome, you can implement one of the following ways to reduce the manufacturing labor cost . How to reduce manufacturing labor costs 1. Track employee work hours Employee work hours tracking errors can have costly ramifications for the manufacturing business. You will be paying for the hours workers did not work. This is why you must ditch the traditional paper sign-in or punching clocks and invest in modern employee time and attendance management systems like Truein.

It is essential to keep the productivity in manufacturing high because it affects costs and profitability and is critical to remain competitive. You should take all the necessary steps to get a competitive edge. This article will entail tips on how to increase productivity in manufacturing, but before that, let’s find out how manufacturing productivity is calculated. Table of Contents How to calculate productivity in manufacturing industry Six ways to improve productivity & efficiency in manufacturing 1. Check what problem your workers are facing 2. Train your employees 3. Increase communication within and outside the company 4. Maintain the machines properly 5. Schedule shifts of employees 6. Automate the manufacturing process Conclusion How to calculate productivity in manufacturing industry Manufacturing productivity is the simple ratio of output to input. It is a simple calculation of how much throughput or quantity you produce compared to the amount of input. The input of a manufacturing company includes labor, overtime, capital resources, natural resources, and other costs. The output is simply the number of goods produced. You can calculate manufacturing productivity as follows: Manufacturing productivity = Output / Input For instance, if your company produces $10,000,000 worth of products in a month by employees putting in 5,000 hours, your company’s manufacturing productivity will be: Manufacturing productivity = 10,000,000 / 5,000 hours = $2,000/hour. However, this value does not equal profit as you have to consider wages, overheads, and other costs. We have kept the calculation simple to be able to understand the productivity level of the company. To truly improve manufacturing productivity, you must consider the following tips. Six ways to improve productivity & efficiency in manufacturing 1. Check what problem your workers are facing The workers are at the center of manufacturing productivity, and project managers should begin by assessing the workforce. You need to understand the problems workers are facing that are reducing their productivity. First, you have to establish that you have the right people working in the teams so that they can properly utilize the available resources and tools. Next, evaluate existing workflow processes to determine how they can be improved. If there are any roadblocks in the process, ask for feedback from workers so you can plan a remedy. Also, you should explore the available technologies and equipment that can help workers improve their productivity with minimum effort. These changes will affect manufacturing productivity positively. You can also have regular discussions with workers on improving manufacturing productivity. Workers on the floor handling machinery and equipment know better what’s not working. To enhance productivity in the long term, it is essential to engage workers during the planning phase. 2. Train your employees If you find that workers lack essential skills, then it is vital to invest in training employees. Companies can improve manufacturing efficiency by implementing a training program to ensure proper coordination of workers and processes. Industry experts agree that employee training is the cornerstone of every productivity strategy. Manufacturing companies should prioritize regular training and maintain detailed training logs of workers. To improve employee efficiency, as a manager, you can set up a personalized schedule for employees to track their progress over time. If you install any new equipment, plan for dedicated training of employees. You should provide employees with additional industry resources and online tools that allow them to learn independently. This is important to set up a team that’s proactively learning to improve efficiency and problem-solving capabilities. A manufacturing industry survey found that a 10% increase in workforce education leads to a productivity boost of 8.6% . 3. Increase communication within and outside the company Improvement of manufacturing productivity also depends on how efficient the communication is with the workers, key suppliers, vendors, and partners. The supply chain is an intricate part of the manufacturing process, so collaboration with suppliers and customer response time should be fast. You can use several tools to improve communication within and outside the company. An ERP can help you maintain open communication with all the stakeholders by offering a constant flow of real-time data. You can track and monitor workers’ performance, supply chains, and operations. With an ERP, you can watch the entire process from procurement to production to distribution which will help you make better decisions. When all the data is available within your dashboard, you can quickly identify shortages or performance issues hindering manufacturing productivity. 4. Maintain the machines properly If your organization is not regularly inspecting tools for efficiency, productivity may lapse. It is surprising to see how many managers look for ways to improve operational efficiency in manufacturing violence while neglecting the machines’ essential maintenance. In manufacturing, this is considered a cardinal sin. We understand that maintenance schedules are inconvenient as they cost time and money, but in the long term, they are an essential part of keeping operations active and equipment safe for workers. Also, companies should keep exploring new and better tools for the job to improve productivity without increasing work hours. Train your staff to keep an eye out for what’s happening with each machine. Maintenance schedules should be consistently maintained. And you should keep spare parts, cables, and other components available for immediate replacement if things break down. Time lost due to breakdowns is one of the main contributors to reduced manufacturing productivity. 5. Schedule shifts of employees Shift scheduling in manufacturing can improve productivity by ensuring that the correct number of workers are on hand to handle the workload at any given time. This can reduce workers’ idle time, which can increase overall efficiency and productivity. Additionally, well-designed shift schedules can help reduce absenteeism and turnover, which can also positively impact productivity. Advanced scheduling software like Truein can make it easier to create and manage shift schedules, further improving efficiency.

Machinery and other equipment bring a certain level of automation, but it’s not enough to replace workers. Without workers, there is no manufacturing, so managers should always pay attention to manufacturing shift schedules. When managing a manufacturing unit, your attention might be divided across the entire manufacturing process, but the primary focus must be on employees. While manufacturing shift scheduling can be tricky, there are some ways to make the whole process simpler. This article will discuss various manufacturing shift patterns and how you can choose the best schedule type for your company. Table of Contents Types and examples of manufacturing shift schedules 1. Rotating shifts 2. DuPont shifts 3. 2-3-2 shifts 4. 4 on 4 off shifts How to pick the proper schedule for your team? 1. See what shift pattern fits your business needs 2. See when you need more workers 3. Please communicate with your employees before assigning any shift and know their preference Best practices to assign shifts with ease 1. Use an automated software 2. Plan the shifts in advance 3. Stay compliant with the local and state rules Conclusion Types and examples of manufacturing shift schedules Understanding the kind of manufacturing shift schedules that most companies implement can help you make a calculated decision. While the best shift schedule model will depend on factors such as workforce size, business needs, and preferences, here are the most common manufacturing shift patterns you must know about. 1. Rotating shifts It’s the literal definition of how this manufacturing shift schedule is. The rotating shift patterns require employees regularly switch between day and night shifts. With rotating shifts , companies can maintain 24/7 operations with fewer workers. For instance, a team can work day shifts for one week while the other works the night shift. The following week, the teams will exchange shifts before returning to their respective shifts. Rotating shifts are standard manufacturing work schedules at companies requiring consistent production without a complex workforce management system. 2. DuPont shifts While rotating manufacturing shift schedules are simple to maintain, they disturb the sleeping pattern of the workers as shift changes are too frequent to get used to. A better alternative is the DuPont manufacturing shift pattern that follows a four-week cycle that uses a 12-hour rotating shift. In this manufacturing shift schedule, you have to divide your workforce into four teams, each switching between day and night shifts with days off between shifts. The main benefit of maintaining such a schedule is that workers in each group get a seven days consecutive break every month. However, for the DuPont rotating shift pattern, you will require four teams, and skilled workers should be in each group. This will require several skilled workers who work longer shifts without much break. 3. 2-3-2 shifts The 2-3-2 work schedule is also known as the Pitman schedule, which is more straightforward than DuPont rotating manufacturing work schedule. It also requires four teams, each team working on a rotating schedule over four weeks. However, the working days are not continuous. The workers work the first two days, then two days off, followed by three days of work, two offs, two working days, and three days off. This is a pattern that is followed for both day and night shifts. As the 2-3-2 shift runs over four weeks, consistency helps workers get used to the rotating shift schedule. But, it can be tiring for workers due to 3 consecutive 12-hour shifts. 4. 4 on 4 off shifts 4 on 4 off manufacturing shift schedules can be implemented at companies that require round-the-clock coverage. While it can be implemented in several patterns, the most common are: 4 days working 4 days off 4 nights working 4 days off This work schedule’s drawback is that workers must work on weekends. However, in the manufacturing industry, workers work weekends in most shift patterns. A significant benefit of 4-on-4 manufacturing shift patterns is that your workers get four days of workweeks with four days off at a time to get enough rest. How to pick the proper schedule for your team? The manufacturing shift schedules we listed might seem more or less the same, but there is a significant difference in how they are implemented and affect workers’ productivity. To increase productivity and efficiency in a manufacturing company you should ensure that workers are well-rested and you have to make a wise decision when choosing a shift schedule. Effective employee scheduling is beneficial for both employers and employees. While workers get to maintain a healthy work-life balance, employers can maintain consistent productivity. To make the decision, you must know your company goals, budget, and workforce strength. Here is what you need to know. 1. See what shift pattern fits your business needs Every shift schedule has its prerequisites. You have to explore the requirements of your organization in depth. Understand whether your company needs to operate 24/7 to meet customers’ requirements in the market. Are there any offs in the manufacturing process currently? What skills do you require in the workers on each shift? It would help if you answer these essential questions to decide which shift pattern fits your business requirements. 2. See when you need more workers Different manufacturing units have other demands, and only some days of the year they do need to operate around the clock. Similarly, you will require more workers during some business hours than the rest. Such as if you need to move inventory earlier in the day. You must know when your company’s demand for products and workers is high. See what changes you can make to the staffing demands and which manufacturing shift schedule is most suitable according to the work demands in each shift. 3. Please communicate with your employees before assigning any shift and know their preference Never impose the new manufacturing work schedule on your workers. Instead, it would help if you communicated the changes with them openly. Your plan must provide a healthy balance between work and personal life. This is important to maintain high employee satisfaction and retention. Currently, 80% of salaried manufacturing workers want their employers to provide more flexible work models. You should always introduce flexibility and seek employee feedback about the new work schedule before you make it live. Best practices to assign shifts with ease 1. Use an automated software Reading through this guide, manufacturing shift scheduling might seem simple, but things can get tricky when you have hundreds of workers to schedule. Managers must have automated software like Truein to help them with shift scheduling. Truein is a comprehensive cloud-based employee time and attendance management software that also features shift scheduling. It is a hardware-less solution that can be easily implemented in the manufacturing industry. Managers can create and share rotating shift schedules through the dashboard.

Plan the shifts in advance Your workers will not appreciate sudden changes in their work schedules. This is why managers must take cognizance of the shift changes in advance to introduce changes gradually. It is also essential to check staff availability before creating a new manufacturing work schedule. 3. Stay compliant with the local and state rules Finally, your manufacturing shift schedules must follow the guidelines of local and state laws regarding work shifts and overtime. It is critical to comply with the rules to create a sustainable shift schedule. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion In the manufacturing industry, efficient workforce management is essential for productivity and profitability.
