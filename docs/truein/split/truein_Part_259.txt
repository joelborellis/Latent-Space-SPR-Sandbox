When workers fail to submit their timesheets on time, it affects the entire payroll management. Getting workers to log their time is a tricky problem for managers. Only a few employees enjoy recording their work hours every day and then submit to their managers. Sometimes, timesheets are filled in correctly; sometimes, workers forget to punch in at the start of their shift, and sometimes they participate in buddy punching . According to an Adobe study , 56% of enterprise workers and 65% of SMB leaders find filling out timesheets significantly distracts employees from actual work. Employee time and attendance management software is the best option to automate timesheet management. However, if the workforce regularly needs more timesheets, it is a challenge for managers to decide how to get employees to submit timesheets on time. An easy solution is a timesheet reminder. Table of Contents What is a timesheet reminder? Why are employees not submitting timesheets on time? 1. Workers are unsure of what to record 2. They might be delaying it willingly 3. Timesheet keeping is tedious and unclear How to get employees to submit timesheets on time? 1. Create a policy around timesheet submission 2. Provide clear guidance on the deadline 3. Set up email reminders with automation Conclusion What is a timesheet reminder? A timesheet reminder, also known as a timecard reminder, is a written or spoken message or an automated notification prompting workers to track their time and submit timesheets. These reminders become necessary to ensure that work hours are logged accurately, and timesheets are submitted before the deadline. While timesheets are essential for employees and employers, it is still common to see workers failing to comply. Before you can take a corrective measure, it’s necessary to understand the reason behind their behavior. Why are employees not submitting timesheets on time? 1. Workers are unsure of what to record If your workers are unaware of the tasks and activities that should be included in timesheets, they can easily get confused and mess up their timesheets. Does time spent in meetings with supervisors count? What if workers are in the store room for some spare part collection? When there are no set guidelines, employees will have no idea what to log and what not to log. Managers should appropriately define billable and nonbillable activities and communicate with the workers. 2. They might be delaying it willingly Often workers wait until the last minute to submit their timesheets and then need to remember. But there are other reasons employees might fail to submit the timesheets. If workers finish their work earlier or later, they might hesitate to fill out their timesheets. It may be because they may assume they look inefficient or get more workload. This can also prompt them to fill in the timesheets inaccurately. 3. Timesheet keeping is tedious and unclear Manually filling out timesheets is a cumbersome exercise that every worker despises. The more details a timesheet requires, the harder it might be to fill. When your workers are busy with their shifts, it is unrealistic to spend time filling out forms to keep track of time throughout the day at work. This is another reason companies should switch from manual to automated employee time tracking. How to get employees to submit timesheets on time? Whatever may be the reason, there are some measures that you can take to ensure employees submit accurate records of hours worked within the deadline. Here are the steps you can take. 1. Create a policy around timesheet submission If your workers are not aware of the consequences they can face if they do not submit their timesheets on time, they will probably miss the deadline. Creating a clear and comprehensive timesheet policy that explains when and how workers should submit their timesheets is essential. Under the policy, managers can detail the rules regarding filling timesheets accurately daily. Mention why workers should submit timesheets when asked (you can say that early submission provides enough time for supervisor review and payroll processing that translates into accurate compensation). Include the period for timesheet submission, whether employees should submit them on the same day, weekly, or monthly. It is also helpful to designate a person to answer any inquiries regarding timesheet-keeping procedures. The same person can be responsible for onboarding new hires and helping them with the timesheet submission process for the first time. 2. Provide clear guidance on the deadline The deadline for timesheets depends on the payroll cycle. A company can have multiple payroll cycles – employees getting paid hourly, weekly, or monthly. You should provide clear guidance on when a particular worker should submit the timesheet depending on his role and payroll schedule. 3. Set up email reminders with automation If you are in the retail or hospitality industry where managers are often busy with customer service, it can be hard to keep monitoring and reminding workers to clock in or out every day without fail. Lapses occur, which if not taken care of can make payroll calculations hard at the end of the month. The managers will scramble to know whether the worker was present or worked their scheduled shift on days they missed clock in or clock out. A simple and highly effective solution is to adopt software that sends daily timesheet reminders. It is a simple yet highly effective measure to ensure employees remember to clock in or out daily. If you are not using an employee time and attendance management software like Truein, then you can set up simple email reminders to alert workers to clock in and out on time and when it is time to submit their timesheets. Here is a sample timesheet reminder email for staff who haven’t filled out their timesheet. Subject: Timesheet Submission Reminder Dear [Employee’s Name], I hope this message finds you well.

Here are some crucial features you shouldn’t miss while choosing an employee scheduling software. 1. Scheduling and shift management Smaller businesses with a few workers can manage with manual scheduling tools or free scheduling plans with software solutions. However, suppose your business requires 24-hour shift coverage. If you operate out of multiple locations or have a large workforce, you will need an employee scheduling app that offers complete scheduling and shift management. Choose a product that provides features like shift optimization, shift-swapping, schedule publishing, auto schedulers, and leave tracking. 2. Timekeeping Any employee scheduling software should have timekeeping features such as clock in and out, time-off requests, timesheet approvals, compliance tracking, etc. Advanced employee scheduling applications with features like geofenced clock-in and facial recognition are best because they help your business against labor and time fraud thus saving both man-hours and money. 3. Payroll integration One of the intrinsic goals of implementing employee scheduling software is to improve productivity and HR automation. The team scheduling app you choose must have a payroll integration feature. When you minimize human intervention in labor hour calculation, you reduce errors and ensure accurate compensation. This saves a lot of time otherwise spent on payroll calculation and also results in higher worker satisfaction. 4. Cost Every company has a different pricing policy. Some charge per-employee fee plans, others offer a one-time fee, while some charge a monthly fee for a set number of accounts. You shouldn’t be penny-wise, pound foolish while choosing an app and choose the cheapest one. First, narrow down the features that you are looking at, compare various apps, and then opt for an employee schedule that provides you with these features at a sustainable cost. Benefits of employee scheduling software 1. Business efficiency The ability to quickly create schedules and give staff access to their shifts via a mobile application hugely improves business efficiency. 2. Ensures Smooth business operations With scheduling apps, you can track shift availability, allow shift swaps, maintain full shift coverage, and implement varying compliance rules to keep running day-to-day operations smoothly. Irrespective of your business type and size, efficient staffing ensures high productivity, shelves are stocked, and projects are completed and delivered on time. 3. Cost savings Efficient scheduling saves hours by improving management productivity. Furthermore, overtime tracking and demand-based shift optimizations prevent redundancies in the scheduling process and reduce payroll costs. Also, correctly tracking employee work hours helps adherence to compliance factors avoiding penalties and fines. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion Companies still using manual employee scheduling tools are wasting valuable resources.
