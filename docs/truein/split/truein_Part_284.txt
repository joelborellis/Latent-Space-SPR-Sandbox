California law on PTO is very detailed to foster an environment of solid work ethics. The state places a strong emphasis on paid time off to ensure the well-being of its workforce. Understanding the intricacies of California’s PTO laws is essential for employers and employees. That’s why we have created this article to be a complete guide on laws regarding paid time off in California. Table of Contents Is paid time off required in California?

Misclassification of workers 4. No payout for accrued vacation upon termination 5. Taking away vacation time How can Truein help with time-off management? Conclusion Is paid time off required in California? In California, employers are not legally required to offer paid time off, vacation days, holiday pay, or personal days. Still, as a general practice, most employers offer paid time off as a benefit to attract and retain talent . If an employer in California offers paid time off, specific legal considerations come into play. Accrual, use, and payment for accrued vacation time are subject to particular rules and regulations at the employer’s discretion. All these policies should be communicated to the employees when hiring. Furthermore, employers are within their rights to restrict eligibility and how vacation time is earned. However, such restrictions should be shared with employees transparently. In the absence of California law on PTO, employers might have the right to handle vacation time as they please, but that’s not the case. Paid time is an earned wage and cannot expire if the employees do not use them. They should be paid for the earned and unused paid time off when they leave the company or are terminated. Additionally, employers cannot take away paid time off as a penalty. How much vacation time does Californian law prescribe? California PTO law does not prescribe a specific amount of vacation time employers must provide their employees. There is no mandated minimum number of vacation days, and employers have the flexibility to establish their policies regarding vacation time. Most employers in California determine the amount of vacation time to offer based on factors such as industry standards, employment contracts, and the company’s internal policies. However, when an employer offers vacation time, they must adhere to the rules and regulations set by the Industrial Welfare Commission . Additionally, all the policies regarding vacation time should be communicated with the employees through employment contracts, company handbooks , or other written documents. It ensures that both parties know the expectations regarding vacation accrual, utilization, and any applicable limitations or conditions. How many vacation days can you get in California? No law specifies the number of vacation days employers must provide in California. As employers have the flexibility to establish their vacation policies, how many vacation days an employee can get can significantly vary. Employers can offer vacation days based on the employee’s length of service, position within the company, and company-wide policies. Can the employer take away accrued vacation time? While there are no required vacation days, according to the California employment law paid time off regulations, if an employer allows paid time off, then once vacation time is accrued, it is generally considered part of an employee’s compensation. Employers cannot take it away. The state treats accrued vacation time as earned wages under the California Labor Code, and it cannot be taken away as a penalty or otherwise. Furthermore, an employer must pay out the accrued vacation time to employees upon separation from employment, whether through resignation, termination, or other means. Can the employer restrict the accrual of vacation time? In California, vacation time cannot expire; hence, no employer can practice a “use-it-or-lose-it” policy. However, employers can avoid accrual of too many vacation days by putting a reasonable cap or enforcing a policy mandating employees to take vacation days. Is vacation pay the same as PTO? While the terms “vacation pay” and “paid time off” (PTO) are often used interchangeably, PTO is an umbrella term that covers vacation days, holiday pay, sick leave, etc. By definition, vacation pay is the compensation provided to an employee when they take time off from work for leisure, relaxation, or personal reasons. While vacation pay is a type of PTO, it is not the same, as it is not required by law that employers provide vacation pay. However, other types of PTO, like sick leaves, must be provided by employers as per California law on PTO. Employers can also combine vacation days, sick leave, and other paid time off into a single bank of hours or days. This consolidated approach simplifies administrative processes for employers. Can an employer withhold earned vacation time? PTO laws in California treat vacation time as earned wages; therefore, earned time off cannot expire or be withheld. Employers cannot withhold earned vacation time once it has been accrued in California. However, employers can manage their vacation time responsibilities by creating policies on how and when it can be used. If an employer has established such a policy or practice, it’s essential to communicate these policies to employees. Do I have to pay employees for unused vacation time upon termination? California Labor Code Section 227.3 emphasizes that- “Unless otherwise provided by a collective-bargaining agreement, whenever a contract of employment or employer policy provides for paid vacations, and an employee is terminated without having taken off his vested vacation time, All vested vacation shall be paid to him as wages at his final rate by such contract of employment or employer policy respecting eligibility or time served; provided, however, that an employment contract or employer policy shall not provide for forfeiture of vested vacation time upon termination.” Yes, employers must pay employees their earned vacation time pay upon termination. What happens to PTO when laid off? California law on PTO clearly states that the “earned” time off, whether it’s vacation days, holiday pay, or personal days, must be paid to the employee when they are laid off or involuntarily separated from employment. However, the mandated paid time off (sick leave) is not required to be paid to the employee who has been laid off. Is use it or lose it vacation legal in California? It’s illegal in California to handle earned vacation time under “use-it-or-lose-it” vacation policies. Such policies require employees to forfeit unused vacation time, but it goes against California Labor Law, which mandates that earned vacation time must be carried over from year to year. How does FTE affect PTO? How is FTE calculated? Full-time equivalent (FTE) is a measurement employers use to standardize the working hours of part-time employees relative to full-time employees. A full-time employee is 1 FTE. FTE is beneficial when calculating benefits, including Paid Time Off (PTO), for part-time employees. So, as long as a part-time employee completes the minimum required work hours, they will be eligible for paid time off as per company policies. FTE Calculation: The formula for calculating FTE is as follows: FTE=Employee’s Hours Worked Per Week/Standard Full-Time Hours Per Week For example, if a full-time employee works 40 hours per week and a part-time employee works 20 hours per week, FTE would be: FTE=20 hours/40 hours=0.5. This number can then be used to decide accrual rates for part-time employees. For instance, in the example above, the part-time employee will accrue PTO at half the rate of a full-time employee. Simply put, if a full-time employee is entitled to 20 days of PTO per year, the part-time employee here will be entitled to 10 days. Is PTO the same as sick leave in California? In California, employers must provide sick leave as the only type of PTO. All other kinds of PTO options are optional. However, unlike additional paid time off, sick leave is not considered an earned wage; hence, employers are not mandated to pay for sick days when an employee is terminated. If employers want, they can allow employees the flexibility to use sick leave for different purposes. Can an employer be sued for unpaid vacation time? If an employer fails to comply with the California PTO laws or the employment agreement terms for vacation time, they can be sued. As California treats accrued vacation time as earned wages, employers must pay out accrued vacation time to employees upon termination or separation. It is illegal for an employer to deny vacation time or not pay when an employee departs from the company. Additionally, under labor laws, no employer can retaliate against employees for exercising their right to vacation time. If an employee faces action for citing wage and hour violations and is fired, it is considered “wrongful termination.” Common California Vacation Law Issues 1. Use-it-or-lose-it policies In California, no employer can implement “use-it-or-lose-it” policies that require employees to forfeit unused vacation time at the end of the year. The earned vacation time does not expire, and employees should be allowed to carry over unused vacation time. 2. Disputes regarding PTO payouts California Labor Laws treat vacation time as earned wages that must be paid to the employees upon termination. Employers denying payout for unused vacation time may lead to potential legal issues. 3. Mandatory vacation time There are no rules regarding mandatory vacation time in California. It is at the sole discretion of employers to offer employees vacation time. However, California has mandated that all employers provide at least three paid sick leaves annually. Common Ways California Employers Deny Vacation Time It is necessary to be aware of the common malpractices that employers are found to use to deny employees vacation time. Employers should not inadvertently or intentionally deny vacation time. Here are some common ways to avoid: 1. Unreasonable restrictions California law on PTO allows employers to let employees accrue vacation days, but other than that, there are no other restrictions. Some employers can use it as an excuse to impose unreasonable restrictions on when employees can take vacation, such as requiring employees to take it only during certain months or specific business cycles. 2. Use of accrual caps Employers can legally cap the number of vacation days an employee can accrue during a work year. However, setting overly restrictive caps on the accrual of vacation time can effectively deny employees the opportunity to accumulate and utilize their earned time off. 3. Misclassification of workers Sometimes, employers can try to avoid providing eligible employees the protection of the California Labor Laws by misclassifying workers as independent contractors. However, misclassification of employees that results in the denial of certain employment benefits, including vacation time, can lead to hefty penalties in California. 4. No payout for accrued vacation upon termination When an employee quits or is terminated, California Labor Laws require employers to issue them the final paycheck within 72 hours. Also, they should be paid for the used paid time off days at the normal wage rate. Employers failing to pay out accrued and unused vacation time upon an employee’s termination or separation violate California labor laws. 5. Taking away vacation time Under the PTO laws California, vacation time is considered earned wage, and employers cannot take away vacation time as a penalty. However, employers can count partial absence from work against paid time off. How can Truein help with time-off management?

Yes, paid time off is a crucial aspect of employment in New York. The state has established a set of regulations that allow employees to take paid time off from work. For instance, the New York State Sick Leave Law (NYSSLL) makes it mandatory for a business with over five workers or a net income of $1 million to provide paid sick and safe leave to employees. The paid time off for safe leave allows a qualifying employee to take time off if the employee or their family member has been the victim of domestic violence. Additionally, the employees must be paid at the normal rate or the applicable minimum wage rate, whichever is greater. Under the paid time off law, employees in New York State accrue sick and safe leave at the rate of one hour off for every thirty hours worked. These laws apply to all private-sector employees, irrespective of their industry, occupation, or type of employment. Awareness of the laws related to different kinds of leaves benefits employers and employees. Also, these regulations may change over time, so you should have the most accurate and up-to-date information on these laws. 1. Vacation leave New York has no specific law mandating paid or unpaid vacation leave. Therefore, the decision to provide paid time off is at the sole discretion of the employers. If an employer chooses to offer paid or unpaid vacation leave, the policies for such leaves must adhere to New York labor law section 198-c . Also, companies must communicate clearly about the accrual, usage, and forfeiture of vacation time. 2. Sick leave The New York State Sick Leave Law regulates decisions regarding sick leaves at a private workspace. The law took effect on April 3, 2020. Under this law: Eligible employees accrue sick leave at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked. Employers with four or fewer employees and a net income of less than $1 million must provide up to 40 hours of unpaid sick leave. Employers with more than four employees must provide up to 40 hours of paid sick leave. Employers with over 100 employees must provide 56 hours of paid sick leave per year. 3. Holiday leave New York state does not mandate private employers to provide paid holidays. However, some businesses may require employees to work on holidays. Still, employers are not obligated to pay employees premium wages, i.e., one and a half times the regular wage , to work on holidays. Offering paid time off for holidays or overtime is generally at the employer’s discretion. It’s crucial for employers offering holiday leave benefits to clearly communicate their holiday leave policies and comply with the terms of the employment contract. 4. Jury duty leave New York Labor Law requires employers to provide employees with time off for jury duty. Under the law, employers must pay employees regular wages (up to $40) for the first three days of jury duty. Employers are not required to pay for the rest of the days spent on jury duty. Also, they cannot penalize employees for fulfilling this civic duty under the New York Judiciary Code 519. 5. Bereavement/funeral leave No New York State laws mandate bereavement or funeral leave for employees. Typically, all businesses allow employers to take time off, also known as bereavement leave, in the event of a death in the family or a close relative. If an employer offers bereavement leave, all the policies regarding bereavement or funeral leave should be available to the employees. 6. Severance pay Under the New York Labor Law, there is no provision regarding employers offering severance pay to the departing employees. Severance pay is typically offered at the employer’s discretion and is often outlined in employment contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or company policies. Employers offering severance pay must clearly outline the terms and conditions under which it is offered, such as length of service, the reason for separation, and any other relevant factors in the work agreement. 7. Paid family leave New York’s Paid Family Leave (PFL) program allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks off at 67% of their wage. As per the program, the family leave covers bonding with a new child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or assisting with family matters when a family member is called to active military service. 8. Blood donation leave New York State allows employees to take 3 hours of leave within 12 months to donate blood at the employer premises. Employers can also provide paid time off twice a year to allow employees to donate blood at a place and time set by the employer. 9. Military spouse leave Spouses of military members are entitled to take up to ten days of unpaid leave when their spouse is on leave from deployment. This leave is designed to provide support to military families to make the most of the time when they are off duty. 10. Crime victim leave There is no mention of any maximum or minimum time off for an employee who is a victim of certain covered felonies. Employers can provide reasonable time for victims to seek medical attention, counseling, legal assistance, or court proceedings. 11. Bone Marrow Donor leave New York provides job-protected leave for employees donating bone marrow. Eligible employees may take up to 24 hours of leave unless allowed by the employer. Employers can also ask for verification from the physician regarding bone marrow donor leave. 12. Witness leave New York State law makes it mandatory for employers to allow employees who are crime witnesses to attend court proceedings without facing adverse employment consequences. Employees must provide advance notice and documentation to verify their crime witness status. 13. Military leave The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is a federal law that protects the employment rights of individuals who serve in the U.S. military. In addition to the USERRA, military members of New York are also protected by the New York employment laws. Employees are entitled to be reemployed after the completion of their service, which includes: 10 days from completing school, reserve drills; 60 days after completing full-time or active-duty training; 90 days after being discharged from active military service or annual training. Such employees should be reinstated to their pre-service positions with the same seniority, status, and pay. 14. Voting leave Eligible and registered employees must be provided up to two hours of paid leave to vote if they do not have sufficient time outside working hours to vote.

Christmas Day – December 25, 2024 (Wednesday) Paid vs. Unpaid Sick Leave In New York, as per the legislation regarding sick paid leave signed on April 3, 2020, employers are required to provide paid or unpaid sick leave to employees, depending on the size and net income of the employer. As per the law: Employers with five or more employees must provide paid time off. Employers with four or fewer employees but a net income of $1 million or more must provide paid sick leave. Employers with four or fewer employees and a net income of less than $1 million must provide unpaid sick time off. Compensation to eligible employees for paid sick leave is at the regular wage rate. New York Sick Leave Accrual The number of paid or unpaid sick time off an employee can accrue depends on the size of the employer’s business. According to New York paid time off rules, employees accrue sick leave at one hour for every 30 hours worked. Employers with more than 100 employees must allow employees to accrue up to 56 hours of sick leave per calendar year. Similarly, employers with less than 100 employees must allow up to 40 hours of sick leave within a year. Employers may choose to frontload the full 40 hours at the beginning of the calendar year. New York Sick Leave Usage New York Sick Leave usage is categorized into sick leave and safe leave. As per the law, employees can use sick leave for various purposes related to their health or the health of family members, including: Mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition of the employee or a family member. Diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care for the employee or a family member. A complete list of sick and safe leave usage is provided here . New York Sick Leave Laws Employers and employees should adhere to some rules to ensure the correct implementation of New York state paid time off laws. Employers must provide notice to employees about sick leave rights. Furthermore, they are prohibited from retaliating against employees for using sick leave. 1. Recordkeeping requirements Under New York Labor Laws, employers must maintain records documenting hours worked and sick leave accrued and taken by each employee for at least six years. Employees can request this record, and if asked, employers must provide them with the information within three working days from the date of request. 2. Local New York Sick Leave Laws Businesses in New York City must also comply with local laws in addition to state laws. Here are some important local New York sick leave laws: Employers should establish clear policies for sick leave accrual, usage, and other related matters. New hires must be allowed to use sick and safe leave time without a waiting period. An employer can only request documentation from a doctor if an employee has taken off for more than three days. One day of rest in seven rule Certain employers must provide employees with at least 24 hours of rest within a work week. This includes businesses in hospitality, factories, and mercantile establishments. Section 161 of the New York State Labor Law covers a complete list of such employers. Is maternity & paternity leave allowed in New York? Under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), employers must provide employees with 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected family leave. Additionally, through the Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, eligible employees can ask for paid time off for the birth, adoption, or fostering a child. Employers must provide adoptive parents with the same paid or unpaid time off benefits as they offer to employees for childbirth if the parents adopt a child under five years of age or 18 if the child has special needs. New York temporary disability benefits law New York has a Temporary Disability Benefits Law (TDBL), which provides short-term disability benefits to eligible employees who are unable to work due to pregnancy-related conditions. Employees can request up to 4 to 6 weeks off under TDBL. They are partially paid to replace lost wages during a period of disability. Is rollover of leaves allowed? Whether leave balances can be rolled over from one year to the next often depends on the employer’s policies. New York state law does not mandate employers to allow the rollover of unused leave. However, employers must inform employees whether and how leave balances may be carried over. When are employers required to pay out unused paid time off? New York has no state law where employers can withhold the payout for unused paid time off (PTO). In most cases, employees must be paid for unused paid time off upon their termination from the company. How does quitting vs being terminated affect the right to be paid out for unused time? Whether quitting or being terminated affects the right to be paid for unused time entirely depends on the employment contract terms. It is at the employer’s discretion to create such policies, but they must be communicated and documented when hiring the employee. How should employers and employees handle disputes over paid time off? Disputes over paid time off can arise when there is a disagreement between an employer and an employee regarding the entitlement or amount of paid time off. Firstly, both parties must carefully read the policies, contracts, and practices regarding paid time off. If any parties fail to comply, it will affect their rights. Ultimately, it is best to hire an attorney to look into legal prospects if disputes are not resolved. How can Truein help with time-off management?
