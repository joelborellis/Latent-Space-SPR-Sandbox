The state has no laws that mandate employers to have paid time off. Awareness of the various paid time off laws in Georgia impacts employers and employees in the state. As an employer in Georgia, you must know the various PTO policies. It is essential to ensure that workers have the opportunity to take time off for multiple reasons while maintaining job security and income stability. Here, we detail Georgia’s PTO laws, including the different types of leaves, accrual systems, payment upon termination, and more. Table of Contents Laws for various types of leaves in Georgia 1. Sick leave 2. Vacation leave 3. Bereavement Leave 4. Jury duty leave 5. Military leave 6. Voting leave 7. Holiday leave 8. Maternity, Paternity, and FMLA 9. Family and Medical Leave What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Georgia PTO laws? What happens to rollover (carry over, brought forward) leaves? Payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay How is payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination made by the employer? What does the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act say about Georgia's paid time-off laws? Limiting and Capping Vacation Hours in Georgia Georgia State Holidays for 2024 How can Truein help with Paid time-off management? Conclusion FAQs 1. Are independent contractors covered under Georgia employment laws? Laws for various types of leaves in Georgia Georgia does not have specific state laws that mandate employers to provide paid or unpaid time off to employees. Here, we take a closer look at the provision of various types of leave and whether state laws exist or policies that individual employers typically determine based on their company policies and practices. 1. Sick leave Employers are not mandated in Georgia to provide employees sick or unpaid sick leave. Employers have the flexibility to provide sick leave as a benefit to employees. They can determine the terms of such leave; however, if they offer sick leave, all the provisions must be outlined in the company’s policies or employment agreements. However, all employers must adhere to the Georgia Family Care Act. If an employer provides sick leaves, the Georgia Family Care Act requires that if the business has at least 25 employees, the company should allow employees to take up to 5 sick leave days to care for their family members if they are ill. To be eligible for such time off, an employee should work at least 30 hours a week. 2. Vacation leave Georgia is one of the states that doesn’t mandate employers to offer vacation days to employees. No state laws exist, so all private employers can create their policies and determine the rules regarding accrual rates, eligibility, and usage. To ensure compliance and transparency, employers must provide access through employee contracts, handbooks , and other documentation. Employees should refer to their employer’s policies to understand their entitlements regarding vacation leave. 3. Bereavement Leave Georgia also does not have specific state laws requiring employers to provide employees bereavement leave. Also known as funeral leave, bereavement leave is provided by employers to allow employees to take time off following the death of a family member or loved one. Again, in the absence of state laws regarding bereavement leave, it’s at the employer’s discretion to choose the policies if they offer bereavement leave. Typically, it is mandatory to outline the terms and conditions in their company policies. 4. Jury duty leave Jury duty leave is mandated by federal law, and Georgia employers must allow employees summoned for jury duty time off. Employers are, however, not required to pay employees for jury duty leave. However, in 1989, an attorney general issued an opinion allowing employees in Georgia to sue employers if they were not paid wages during jury duty. However, till now, there have been no cases where this opinion is backed up in any court. Counties have provided instructions regarding the same to jurors. Employees can fulfill their civic duty as jurors without fear of retaliation or adverse employment consequences. No employer can stop employees from taking the necessary time off for jury duty service. 5. Military leave By federal law, Georgia law provides job protection and specific benefits to employees who are members of the National Guard or reserves and are called to active duty or military training. Georgia does not have specific state laws governing these types of leave; it sticks with the federal law of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) that provides additional protections and rights for employees in certain situations. Under USERRA, any member of a military organization can take time off to serve in an active mission. Employers must comply with these provisions and grant military leave as the law requires. Employers and employees in Georgia should be aware of federal and company-specific policies regarding leave entitlements and responsibilities. 6. Voting leave In Georgia, like in other states, employers must allow employees paid time off to take two hours off from work when there are federal, state, or local elections. It also applies if employees need more time to vote outside working hours. However, employers can decide when employees get time off to vote, and employees must request this leave in advance. No employer can deduct pay from employees who take voting leave as required by law as long as they take only two hours off. 7. Holiday leave There is no provision that employers in Georgia should provide paid or unpaid holiday leave to employees. Individual employers can recognize holidays and provide paid time off on holidays. However, most employers observe the common holidays in Georgia, such as New Year’s Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Georgia generally observes 13 state holidays: Holiday General Date New Year’s Day 2024 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. 3rd Monday in January Good Friday 2 days before Easter Memorial Day Last Monday in May Juneteenth June 19 Independence Day July 4 Labor Day 1st Monday in September Columbus Day 2nd Monday in October Veterans Day November 11 Thanksgiving Day 4th Thursday of November State Holiday Day after Thanksgiving Washington’s Birthday 3rd Monday in February Christmas Day December 25 8. Maternity, Paternity, and FMLA Georgia follows the federal Family and Maternity Leave Act (FMLA) that provides eligible employees unpaid leave and job protection for specific family and medical reasons, including maternity and paternity requirements. Under FMLA, all eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave in 12 months. This leave is for both mothers and fathers for the birth, adoption, or placement of a child. Also, they can take leave for the employee’s serious health condition or a close family member. Maternity and paternity leave must be part of the benefits so the employees can take time off to bond with a new child or address medical needs while preserving their job security. 9. Family and Medical Leave As mentioned above, all family and medical leave requirements are governed by FMLA, as Georgia has no state laws regarding these leaves. In addition to maternity and paternity leave, FMLA allows employees in Georgia to take unpaid leave to attend to family members with severe health conditions, recover from a serious health condition themselves, or address specific military family needs, such as caregiving and exigency leave. What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Georgia PTO laws? As Georgia has no state laws to govern vacation time, employers have complete discretion to create policies regarding accrual vacation systems for their employees. Employers must provide information to employees on how accrual rates will work. It determines how quickly employees accrue vacation leave, often based on factors such as an employee’s length of service, job position, or company policy. Employers should also set caps so employees only accrue a few vacation days. Once employees reach this cap, they may stop accruing additional vacation time until they use some accrued days. Policies regarding how the employees can request and use their accrued vacation leave, carry-over or forfeiture of unused vacation days, and pay out of accrued, unused vacation upon termination should also be shared with employees. What happens to rollover (carry over, brought forward) leaves? Georgia doesn’t prohibit the use it or lose it policy. Employers have the discretion to decide how rollover or carry-over leaves are treated. If the employer permits employees to carry over unused vacation days from one year to the next, clear guidelines must be provided. Employers can have a “use it or lose it” policy, which means that employees must use their accrued vacation days within a specified timeframe, typically during the calendar year. Any unused days at the end of this period are forfeited and not carried over into the next year. However, employers are not recommended to implement this policy as it can feel discriminatory. Instead, control the number of rollovers by capping the total number of PTO days. Employers can allow a limited number of vacation days to be carried over while imposing a cap on the maximum number of days that can be accumulated. Payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination Georgia PTO laws do not state that employers have to pay for unused vacation days at the end of the year instead or when an employee is terminated. Whether employees are paid for unused vacation time when they resign or are terminated depends on company policies. The employer’s policies and employment agreements typically determine the payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination in Georgia. Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay Georgia has no statutory provisions for vacation day payout. How the payout, if allowed, is handled depends on individual employers. Therefore, employees should carefully read company policies on payment for accrued, unused vacation days if an employee’s employment is terminated due to resignation, retirement, or other reasons. How is payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination made by the employer? The employer typically decides the payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination. Suppose the policies allow payment for accrued, unused vacation. In that case, the employee is entitled to receive the payout within 14 days when they are terminated, whether due to resignation, retirement, or other reasons. The payment for unused vacation time is typically included in the final paycheck. It can be made through a physical check, direct deposit, or other electronic payment methods, depending on the employer’s payroll processes and the employee’s preferences. What does the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act say about Georgia's paid time-off laws? The Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) mandates that employers with 50 or more workers for 20 weeks in a year follow the FMLA guidelines for paid time off. Under FMLA, eligible employees in Georgia can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for 12 months. To be eligible, they must have worked at least 1,250 hours in 12 months. Qualifying FMLA-eligible events when an employee can avail of paid time off include: The birth or adoption of a child To bond with a new child The care of a seriously ill family member An employee’s serious health condition To take care of a family member who has suffered seriously in military service Limiting and Capping Vacation Hours in Georgia Georgia PTO laws are nonexistent regarding limiting and capping vacation hours. Employers determine limits on the number of vacation hours an employee can accrue or use. The caps are established to prevent employees from accumulating excessive unused vacation days. Once employees reach the maximum accrual limit, they may stop accruing additional vacation hours until they use some of their accrued time. Furthermore, Georgia allows use-it-or-lose-it policies that require employees to use their accrued vacation days within a specified period. Any unused vacation hours at the end of a year are forfeited and do not carry over into the following year.

For employers in the state, familiarity with the existing and updated Illinois Paid Time Off (PTO) laws is essential for providing workers with benefits mandated by the state laws. The new Illinois PTO law is designed to promote fair and equitable treatment of employees by employers. In this comprehensive guide on Illinois paid leave, we will explore the key aspects of Illinois PTO laws. Table of Contents Do the Illinois PTO laws apply to all employers? What are the qualifying reasons for paid time off? Who will be eligible for paid leave? How many hours of paid leave can employers allot to workers? Laws for Various Types of Leaves in Illinois 1. Sick leave 2. Maternity, Paternity, & FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) 3. Bereavement leave 4. Jury duty leave 5. Military leave 6. Voting leave Can employees carry over unused leave? Do you have to include the Illinois paid time balance on pay stubs? Illinois State Holidays for 2024 How can Truein help with Paid time-off management? Conclusion FAQs 1. Does the Act apply to part-time employees or just full-time employees? 2. What does this law mean for temporary employees who work for 3rd-party clients? 3. How does this law apply to companies with employees working in multiple states, including Illinois? 4. Does Illinois PTO law apply to interns? Do the Illinois PTO laws apply to all employers? Yes, since January 1, 2024, Illinois’ Paid Leave for All Workers Act came into effect, which makes it mandatory for Illinois employers to provide pay for “any reason” to employees. The new law marks a significant shift in employment law within the state as it applies to all private employers irrespective of their business industry and size. Under the new Illinois paid leave law, all employers must provide their employees with up to 40 hours of paid leave annually for any reason. This Act is crucial for employees and employers, ensuring workers can manage personal matters without losing pay and enhancing productivity and job satisfaction. Employees earn 1 hour of paid time off for every 40 hours worked. However, this Illinois PTO law excludes independent contractors and exempt employees covered by collective bargaining agreements in certain industries. What are the qualifying reasons for paid time off? Who will be eligible for paid leave? According to Illinois paid time off law, an employee can ask for paid leave for one of the following reasons: sick leave vacation, childcare mental health, and medical appointments All employees, regardless of their role or industry, are eligible for this leave, provided they meet the essential criteria set by the Act​​. It includes all the employees in the private and public sectors, full-time and part-time. However, this Act does not cover temporary part-time and student employees in schools and universities. The new Illinois PTO law also covers family members of eligible employees, including children, spouses, parents, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, and stepparents. However, employers can create policies regarding paid leave, such as when employees should inform managers of the leave. How many hours of paid leave can employers allot to workers? As part of the Paid Leave for All Workers Act, as of January 1, 2024, all Illinois employers must provide a minimum of 40 hours of paid leave per year to eligible employees. However, this is the minimum state requirement; employers can offer more paid time off depending on the company policies. Employees will earn one hour of paid leave for every 40 hours worked, and employers must ensure all employees receive at least 40 hours of paid sick leave annually. Laws for Various Types of Leaves in Illinois In Illinois, various types of leave are governed by federal and state laws. Additionally, employers can create policies related to different kinds of leave in Illinois. Let’s take a look at the different types of leave available. 1. Sick leave All employers are mandated to follow the Employee Sick Leave Act (Public Act 99-0841) . It allows employees to have specific days for sick leaves to attend to their or a close family member’s health and medical requirements. The Act allows employees “for absences due to an illness, injury, or medical appointment of the employee’s child, spouse, [domestic partner], sibling, parent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandchild, grandparent, or stepparent, for reasonable periods as the employee’s attendance may be necessary, on the same terms upon which the employee can use sick leave benefits for the employee’s illness or injury.” As of January 1, 2024, employees can accrue at least 40 hours of paid sick leave per year. 2. Maternity, Paternity, & FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) applies to eligible employees in Illinois. Employers must be familiar with the requirements of FMLA, which provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in 12 months for eligible employees for qualifying reasons, including the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child, serious health conditions, and military caregiving. The maternity and paternity leave provisions are included within FMLA, allowing employees to apply for unpaid leave during pregnancy. Pregnant employees are entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the FMLA. It is available for fathers, too, who need time to bond with the new child. It is also applicable during the adoption of a child. Paternity leave is also 12 weeks and may be continuous, unless otherwise specified by an employer. Additionally. the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is another federal law that all employers in Illinois must follow. It protects pregnant women from discrimination in all areas of employment: hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, fringe benefits, training, leave, and health insurance. 3. Bereavement leave Illinois, unlike most states, has specific state laws mandating bereavement leave. These are the Child Bereavement Leave Act, a law included in the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Family Bereavement Leave Act. These laws have been in effect since 2023. The FMLA mandates that all employers should provide at least ten unpaid days for bereavement in case of the loss of a child. The employee should apply for bereavement leave within 2 months of the death of the child. Employers typically determine other policies related to bereavement leave. Employees may use paid time off or unpaid leave for bereavement purposes, depending on company policies. 4. Jury duty leave Illinois state law requires employers to provide unpaid leave to employees summoned to serve on a jury. All Illinois employers must allow employees at least two hours of paid time off to cast their votes during federal, state, or local elections. No employer can penalize or discharge employees for fulfilling their civic duty by serving on a jury. However, they can decide when the employees take time off to vote during work hours. 5. Military leave Illinois employers are required to follow the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) law that provides employment protections and reemployment rights for military service members. The law allows employees to join military service when needed without losing their jobs. It guarantees 24 months of health benefits and 5 years of unpaid time off for military leave. Apart from the federal law, there are some state laws as well. Illinois Service Member Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (ISERRA) is practical since January 2019, simplifying and consolidating existing Illinois military service laws and providing additional protections, supplementing the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Under this law, service members are not required to get employer permission for military leave but must provide advance notice. Public employees receive additional benefits like paid military leave and expanded health coverage. All service members who take military leave are credited with average efficiency or performance ratings for the three years before the leave, with periods of military duty counted as civilian service for seniority or promotion eligibility. 6. Voting leave Illinois PTO law requires all employers to provide eligible employees with up to two hours of paid voting leave if they do not have sufficient time to vote before or after their work shift. Employers must grant employees voting leave to participate in the democratic process by voting in elections. Can employees carry over unused leave? Under the Illinois Employee Sick Leave Act, employers must be allowed to carry over unused leave to the following year. However, employers are required to pay for any unused PTO. Additionally, employers can cap the number of leaves that can be rolled over to the following year. Do you have to include the Illinois paid time balance on pay stubs? As of January 1, 2022, Illinois employers must include employees’ available paid leave balances on their pay stubs or a document provided to employees on each payday. Also, the same should be provided to employees if they request it. This transparency allows employees to track their accrued and used sick leave hours. Illinois State Holidays for 2024 Employers in Illinois should be aware of the state holidays for 2024, which may affect business operations and employee scheduling. Here is a tentative list of Illinois state holidays in 2024: Holiday 2024 Date General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January President’s Day Monday, February 19 3rd Monday in February Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Juneteenth Wednesday, June 19 June 19 Independence Day Thursday, July 4 July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 1st Monday in September Columbus Day Monday, October 14 2nd Monday in October General Election Day Tuesday, November 5 November 2 to 8 Veterans’ Day Monday, November 11 November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 4th Thursday of November Thanksgiving Friday Friday, November 29 Day after Thanksgiving Christmas Day Wednesday, December 25 December 25 How can Truein help with Paid time-off management?
