Managing employee burnout requires thorough understanding of what’s causing it because if unchecked it can massively impact your employee’s productivity. Employee burnout occurs when individuals experience prolonged dissatisfaction, stress, and exhaustion due to their work, leading to severe physical, emotional, and mental fatigue. Beyond demotivated employees and lack of productivity, burnout can take a toll on your employees physical and mental health. This article explores the signs of employee burnout across industries, delves into its causes, and offers insights on managing the issue.

Provide adequate training 5. Monitor employee well-being 6. Conduct open communication sessions Truein for attendance management and scheduling Conclusion FAQs 1. How do you overcome employee burnout? 2. Why should organizations care about employee burnout? How do you spot signs of Employee Burnout? 1. Sickness A high absenteeism rate due to illness can indicate employee burnout. According to a study by the American Psychological Association , employees experiencing high levels of workplace stress are twice as likely to report ailments such as headaches, anxiety, colds, and flu. If you are witnessing a noticeable increase in health-related absenteeism, it can indicate burnout. Managers must investigate the potential burnout issues before they spiral out of control. 2. Mistakes & errors Preventing employee burnout is paramount in industries where precision and safety are critical. However, the consequences of burnout-related mistakes can be severe for any industry. Most blue-collar job positions require repetitive, physical labor, which accelerates burnout. Research from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) indicates that workers experiencing burnout are more prone to errors resulting in injuries and accidents. Companies must monitor noticeable spikes in workplace accidents or near misses. Such incidents can be indicative of employee burnout requiring immediate attention. 3. Low motivation Another sign of employee burnout is lack of motivation and dropping productivity levels at work. Employee burnout can be a significant reason for brain drain, especially in blue-collar sectors where repetitive and physically demanding work is common. For such roles, motivation is essential for maintaining productivity. If your company is experiencing lower output or production inefficiency and workers lack enthusiasm for their tasks, take it as a warning sign of employee burnout. 4. Higher Employee Attrition Rates A notable surge in turnover rates, particularly among trained and experienced workers, is a red flag for employee burnout. Unsurprisingly, high employee burnout is typically accompanied by high employee turnover. If your workers are resigning in droves, it is a symptom that the work environment is no longer positive and encouraging for them. Another reason preventing employee burnout is essential is that recruiting costs can be much higher. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the cost of replacing an employee can range from 50% to 60% of their annual salary . If your organization fails to manage employee burnout, your employees will seek alternative job opportunities, forcing you to face increased recruitment and training costs. 5. Irritability or hostility in the workplace Hostile and irritable behavior at work is a serious concern that can harm team dynamics and disrupt productivity. Suppose your workers are showing behaviors such as complaining more and more about coworkers, tasks assigned to them, or company culture. In that case, it can indicate early signs of employee burnout. In blue-collar settings, where teamwork is essential, as many workers work together, heightened irritability can create a toxic work environment. Frequent conflicts and a palpable tension among employees are signs of potential employee burnout. Managers must proactively look for signs of effective early intervention and prevention of employee burnout. Once it is determined that your workforce is suffering from burnout, the next step is to identify the causes so you can foster a healthier work environment, reduce costly turnover, and maintain productivity and safety standards. Here are the common causes of employee burnout. Causes of employee burnout 1. Heavy workload with tight deadlines Industries employing blue-collar workers have demanding tasks and strict production schedules. It means that workers in such sectors deal with physically demanding tasks and pressure to meet deadlines. This combination of too much labor and stress to be productive can significantly contribute to burnout. According to a study by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, heavy workloads were identified as a leading cause of burnout among blue-collar employees. Burnout becomes a real risk if your company constantly pushes employees to their limits. Furthermore, monotonous work can exacerbate burnout in industries like construction and manufacturing, where assembly lines or repetitive tasks are common. For companies with tasks that lack variety and involve constant repetition, finding ways to mitigate a sense of stagnation and disinterest in managing employee burnout is essential. 2. Lack of communication Effective communication is essential in any workplace, but it becomes necessary for industries employing blue-collar workers as teamwork and coordination are fundamental in such companies. With clear and open communication channels, workers may feel safe and connected with their supervisors and colleagues. Such isolation may lead to a struggle to voice concerns and seek assistance when needed and can contribute to feelings of burnout. You must establish strong communication channels between teams and management to ensure employees can handle the lack of support or information, which can intensify stress and lead to burnout. 3. Unfair treatment Burnout employees are not only a product of physically demanding work; unfair treatment can also contribute. Unfair workforce management practices, such as discrimination or favoritism, can significantly contribute to burnout among blue-collar employees. In workplaces with unfair treatment of employees and where promotions, assignments, or recognition appear biased or unevenly distributed, workers are most likely to develop resentment, frustration, and disillusionment. For any company, teamwork and mutual trust among workers are critical. Any perceptions of unfair treatment can disrupt the cohesion of the workforce. 4. Poor employee training Adequate training can help prevent employee burnout by ensuring that employees are confident and competent. Skilled employees often work with machinery or perform physically demanding tasks; needing to be trained appropriately can lead to feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. This, in turn, can contribute to stress and burnout. If your workers feel unprepared or unsupported in their roles, they are more likely to experience burnout. You must create training and skill development programs to ensure employees can upskill and not constantly worry about making mistakes or facing dangerous situations. As evident, almost every company has these underlying causes, which, if left unchecked, can cause productivity issues. Here are some steps for preventing employee burnout. How do you manage employee burnout? 1. Promote work-life balance Maintaining and encouraging employees to have a healthy work-life balance is an excellent way to prevent burnout. Create work policies that respect employees’ time outside work, such as flexible working hours and generous vacation allowances. Ensure your employees get enough opportunities to recharge and spend time with their families. 2. Define, Modify, and Optimize corporate ethics and values Your corporate ethics and values clearly define what you want and what you expect from your employees. If you do not have set ethics and values, define them. On the other hand, if you have core ethics and values, you must alter the principles of it every now and then. Remember: employee health comes first and expressing it through company values is imperative. 3. Set realistic workloads Unrealistic workloads and multitasking put undue pressure on your workers. Managers must assess workloads and deadlines to ensure they are achievable for employees. Scheduling tools like Truein can help manage workloads by prioritizing tasks effectively to help employees. 4. Provide adequate training You are responsible for ensuring employees have the necessary tools, equipment, and training to perform their jobs effectively and safely. You should create an ongoing training and skill development program, say, for soft skill training, to boost employee confidence. 5. Monitor employee well-being Management must keep a watchful eye on employee well-being. You can regularly check in with employees through surveys, one-on-one meetings, or anonymous feedback mechanisms. The feedback from employees will provide the information managers need to identify potential burnout risks and address them promptly. Management can also craft a mental health policy for its workers. 6. Conduct open communication sessions Discuss openly about problems faced by employees at the workplace. Such open discussions eases anxiety and stress experienced at the workplace. Also, it helps finding solutions to issues faced at the workplace. Truein for attendance management and scheduling Truein is a face recognition time and attendance tool that offers robust scheduling options too.

Just like retail and manufacturing, the construction industry largely depends on manual labor. While the other two sectors have turned innovative & reinvented themselves, the construction industry continues to still work on old practices. According to the global Construction productivity report, construction labor productivity has averaged only 1 percent annually over the past two decades. In comparison for the same period, the global labor productivity for manufacturing was 3.6 percent. The McKinsey report thus underlines the need for reinventing how a construction workplace functions. If your construction workplace suffers from poor productivity issues, you should look at alternative solutions that can help boost productivity. Here, we explore how construction labor productivity can be improved sustainably. Table of Contents What are the factors affecting Labor efficiency? 1. Workplace environment & employee wellness 2.

Lack of assistive tools and technologies Conclusion FAQs 1. What affects construction productivity? 2. What is Labor efficiency? What are the factors affecting Labor efficiency? 1. Workplace environment & employee wellness Take a hard look at your construction workplace to determine how the work environment is. If the workplace environment is based on putting pressure on employees with unrealistic deadlines and long work hours, then in the long run, it would not make employees feel safe, valued, and supported.  In the long run, labor productivity will suffer and attrition would increase. A positive workplace environment and employee wellness go hand in hand. Companies with open communication, straightforwardness, and cooperation in their workforce management can help build high employee morale. 2. Pay Structure Pay is the primary motivator at any workplace and the construction industry is no different. Due to the nature of work, construction workplaces tend to hire many contract workers. Treating such workers differently from full-time employees isn’t uncommon in organizations. Yet, sometimes, such discrepancies can be a significant reason for declining construction productivity. If the company is maintaining an optimum pay structure for its employees, then the company should make its workers aware of how the pay structure works, as it can be one of the reasons behind why employees are not motivated to give their best. 3. Employee Diversity A lack of employee diversity can also be one of the reasons for poo r labor productivity in the construction industry. Diversity in the workforce is essential for employee engagement. Construction work employs many workers, and hiring people with distinctive qualities, cultures, and religions can give workers a sense of belonging. Furthermore, employee diversity is the best way to create an environment for workers that makes them learn and excel with people with different perspectives. 4. Lack of assistive tools and technologies Employees will need tools and modern technology to be productive. In the construction industry, where tasks require a lot of hard work, providing workers with the correct tools directly impacts productivity. For instance, if workers have to do demolition work without proper tools, it can take weeks, while the same work can be completed within a few days by using power tools. Also, companies must invest in training employees on using tools and technology at the construction workplace. Untrained employees not only delay the work, they also cause resource mismanagement. This can further have productivity and financial implications. Ensure that your construction workplace doesn’t have these productivity roadblocks. If you need to learn how to start, here are ten tips to boost construction productivity. 10 Tips to improve construction productivity 1. Update construction inventory all-the-time Construction projects have a large inventory, which needs regular updating. Poor management of inventory is one of the reasons why projects get delayed. You cannot depend on the workers to notify you about the shortage of construction materials or tools; project managers and supervisors must always proactively do inventory audits. It immediately ensures that the required construction materials, tools, and assistance are available at the construction site. Use tools for proper planning and forecasting so that building materials and supplies are regularly restocked before they run out. It will help improve labor productivity in construction industry. 2. Use technology to create better workflows Construction efficiency can be boosted directly by implementing technological improvements in the workplace. Remember the 1 percent labor-productivity rate McKinsey reported every year is primarily because of poor adoption of modern technology in the construction industry? Construction companies can streamline project workflows, identify productivity issues, and deploy solutions much faster using technologies like project management software. It can also improve productivity by automating employee attendance using time and attendance system . Software products can optimize workflows, improve workforce management, centralize documentation, and reduce manual reporting thus considerably boosting your team’s productivity and in the end, construction output. 3. Focus on workplace flexibility Workplace flexibility can be a contributing factor for boosting productivity. Construction work is labor intensive, so you must ensure workers are adequately rested. Employees with optimum physical and mental health are in the best shape to operate machinery and tools and this has a profound impact on construction productivity. Create flexible work shifts allowing workers to have a better work-life balance. It also reduces pressure at the workplace and attracts more candidates. 4. Focus on employee training and development For any industry, investing in the workforce’s skills is essential. The construction industry is no exception. Regular training and upskilling sessions can help enhance your employees skills, build their confidence and motivate them to further improve their overall quality of work. 5. Invest in construction planning Construction planning is imperative for companies to identify potential bottlenecks before the start of any project. A well-structured plan leads to higher productivity at the construction site while minimizing last minute hiccups and allowing for better resource allocation. Proper construction planning will allow you to deliver building materials through shorter routes and also can also help optimize the use of inventory and storage space. This ensures timely availability of building materials and supplies at the site thus preventing delays. 6. Integrate data and analytics in the construction Construction projects generate a lot of data that can be effectively used for collaboration and insights through data analytics. Most of the data at construction sites is not checked and analyzed, leading to poor project management and efficiency. With the right platform and tools, you can utilize data and analytics to monitor project progress, identify labor inefficiencies, and make informed decisions. Integrating data and analytics in construction is a data-driven approach for better project management. 7. Hire trained supervisors & managers Competent supervisors and managers at the project site ensure that operations run smoothly and workers are not facing any productivity issues. When the leaders know how to get things done, other employees don’t have to face issues at the site, which keeps the project going without any delays. Trained managers have the skills and experience to ensure that tasks are allocated effectively, task deadlines are met, and problems are promptly addressed. 8. Set realistic goals We understand the requirement to deliver project fasters, but you must set realistic goals. Take time to analyze the available resources and manpower and compare it with the project deadlines to set realistic goals for teams. Also, you can use project management applications to leverage data collected at various sites to create accurate team deadlines. You might have the best workforce, but their productivity is still limited, so setting realistic goals will put an end to undue pressure and mental stress. Best managers set attainable goals for workers to encourage employees and boost their productivity levels. 9. Offer employee recognition Recognizing and appreciating the efforts of your workers fosters construction productivity. Your employees need your positive feedback and recognition of their hard work to know their commitment to their work is valued. It boosts morale and encourages higher levels of commitment and productivity. Offering incentives in the form of rewards can be a great way to show appreciation for their hard work. 10. Go for shorter construction contracts Construction contracts with ambiguous terms and legal jargon can be difficult for teams to understand. How can you expect construction productivity to be high if the teams cannot understand the project outline? Create clear and concise construction contracts of short length so workers know what they are supposed to do and perform accordingly. Short construction contracts ensure all team members are on the same page with clarity. It eliminates the need to rework contracts, saving a lot of cost and time. What are the factors affecting Labor efficiency? 1. Workplace environment & employee wellness Take a hard look at your construction workplace to determine how the work environment is. If the workplace environment is based on putting pressure on employees with unrealistic deadlines and long work hours, then in the long run, it would not make employees feel safe, valued, and supported.  In the long run, labor productivity will suffer and attrition would increase.
