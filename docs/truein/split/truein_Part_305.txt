Paid time off encompasses a range of leave types, such as vacation, sick leave, and other special-purpose leaves. Employers in the state must adhere to federal rules such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and state laws. Understanding PTO laws is crucial for employers and employees, as they impact workplace productivity, employee well-being, and compliance with legal standards. This guide for employers provides essential guidelines about North Carolina PTO laws. Table of Contents FMLA Federal Law Followed in North Carolina Maternal and Paternal Leave Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act Child Care Leave Family Illness Leave Paid Time Off in North Carolina Paid Leaves in North Carolina Parental Leave Organ Donorship Leave American Red Cross Disaster Service Leave Vacation Leave Military Leave Sick Leave in North Carolina Voting Leave in North Carolina Jury Duty Leave Community Service Leave Bereavement Leave PTO Payout on Termination in North Carolina How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion FMLA Federal Law Followed in North Carolina North Carolina necessitates the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for all employers. Enacted in 1993, FMLA entitles the employees of all public agencies, all public and private elementary and secondary schools, and companies with 50 or more employees to unpaid leave. Under the provisions of FMLA, all eligible employees in the state have the right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for family or medical reasons. Employees can take FMLA leaves for several reasons: The birth and care of a newborn child of the employee. The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care. Attend medical needs of an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) suffering from a serious health condition. To time off when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. For any qualifying exigency if the employee is family to a military member on “covered active duty.” To be eligible to benefit under FMLA, an employee should meet the following eligibility requirements: Employees must work for a covered employer for at least 12 months Have worked for at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months Work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles FMLA only applies when time off is for medical and family care reasons. Here are the primary leaves included in the FMLA provisions. Maternal and Paternal Leave North Carolina has no specific state or local maternal and paternal leave laws. However, all employers should follow the FMLA guidelines for maternal and paternal leave. Under the FMLA, employees can take unpaid leave for up to 12 weeks for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child. This provision applies to both mothers and fathers, ensuring equitable access to parental leave. Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act FMLA has ensured that there is no discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), enacted in 1978, prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, ensuring that pregnant employees are treated fairly in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, promotions, and benefits. The Pregnancy Disability Act provides additional protection for employees with pregnancy-related disabilities. This includes access to sick leave, modified work duties, or other reasonable accommodations, ensuring that pregnant employees are not disadvantaged in the workplace due to their condition. Child Care Leave FMLA also includes provisions for child care leave, allowing parents to take time off to care for a child with a serious health condition. North Carolina also has the Small Necessities Law , also known as Parental Involvement Leave, which is part of the child care leave. It allows employees (parents, guardians, or someone standing in Loco Parentis (acting in place of parents)) to take up to 4 hours of unpaid leave to attend a child’s school-related activities. Family Illness Leave Family illness leave is a special provision that allows employees to take unpaid time off due to a family member’s severe medical condition. Employees cannot use family illness leave for their own medical care needs. Under this provision, an employee can take up to 52 weeks of unpaid time off over 5 years. They can use this leave once they have exhausted their FMLA benefits. Paid Time Off in North Carolina North Carolina has no provisions for offering paid time off except paid parental leave. New parents can take 4 to 8 weeks of paid time off to recover from childbirth or bond with their newborn. While North Carolina does not have a state-mandated PTO policy, employers typically offer PTO as part of their benefits package to attract and retain employees. As there are no NC PTO laws, employers can decide the Accrual System if they allow paid time off for their employees. Generally, employers in the state allow employees to accumulate leave over time based on their length of service or the number of hours they work. An accrual system incentivizes long-term employment and provides employees with progressively greater benefits over time. Additionally, North Carolina allows a use-it-or-lose-it policy that prohibits employees from rolling over unused PTO from one year to the next. Employers can require employees to use their PTO within a specific timeframe or forfeit it. Paid Leaves in North Carolina One of the most important aspects of North Carolina PTO laws employers must consider while outlining their policies is paid leave. In the state, there are several types of paid leave, such as parental leave, organ donorship leave, and disaster service leave. Parental Leave North Carolina provides paid parental leave for state employees, ensuring new parents have time to bond with their children without worrying about lost wages. At the same time, private employers must provide paid time off for parental leave of up to 4 to 8 weeks. It applies to a child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement. Eligible employees can take paid parental leave, which can be used consecutively or intermittently within 12 months of the qualifying event. This leave ensures parents have sufficient time to adjust to their new family dynamic and attend to their child’s needs. Organ Donorship Leave North Carolina supports organ and bone marrow donation by requiring employers to allow paid time off for employees who donate. The organ donorship leave gives employees the right to take up to 30 days of paid leave for organ donation or up to 7 days for bone marrow donation. American Red Cross Disaster Service Leave Employees who are a part of the American Red Cross disaster service can take up to 15 days of paid leave annually to assist with disaster recovery efforts. Eligible employees can take up to 15 paid days within 12 months. Vacation Leave Vacation leave policies vary among private employers in North Carolina, with some offering paid vacation while others do not. For North Carolina state employees, vacation leave is typically accrued based on years of service. Here are the duration and corresponding vacation days annually: Worked for less than 5 years – Receive 14 vacation days per year Worked for 5-10 years – Receive 17 vacation days per year Worked for 15-20 years – Receive 23 vacation days per year Worked for 20 or more years – Receive 26 vacation days per year Employees can utilize their vacation time as needed. [b1] Military Leave North Carolina allows paid military leave to state employees, while private employees can be paid or unpaid depending on company policies. State employees can take up to 120 hours of paid time off per fiscal year. This ensures that employees can fulfil their military obligations without losing their civilian jobs. Those on reserve duty can take up to 30 days off with pay, while those in civil air patrol and state defense militia can be granted 120 hours of paid/unpaid time off in a calendar year. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is the federal providing military service members the right to reemployment. It ensures that service members who leave their civilian jobs to perform military service can return to their jobs with the same seniority, status, pay, and other rights as if they had remained continuously employed. Under USERRA, service members may continue their group health coverage for up to 24 months when called for active service. Additionally, they can take up to 5 years of unpaid time off from their employment to serve in the military. Sick Leave in North Carolina North Carolina doesn’t mandate paid sick time off. All employers are required to follow the FMLA guidelines for paid leave; there are no additional state laws. Under the FMLA, all employees can receive up to 12 weeks of time off if eligible. The employees should have worked with their current employer for at least a year to be eligible. They should have worked for at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months and should be working at a site where 50 or more employees are working within a 75-mile radius. Sick leave provides sufficient time to cover illnesses, medical appointments, or other health-related needs. Employees can also use the time for family members’ medical needs, such as caring for a sick child or spouse. Private employers in North Carolina can provide additional sick leave to their employees.  The specifics of sick leave policies, such as accrual rates and maximum allowable leave, can vary depending on the employer and the terms outlined in the employment contract or employee handbook. Voting Leave in North Carolina There is no North Carolina PTO law regarding voting leave, so employers can provide it as a benefit. While there is no legal obligation to provide voting leave, offering this benefit or supporting alternative voting options aligns with a broader commitment to civic engagement and employee welfare. If employers offer voting leave, they have sole discretion to decide whether it is paid or unpaid. Jury Duty Leave Jury duty is a civic responsibility that ensures the legal system functions effectively and fairly. North Carolina requires employers to allow employees time off if they are called for jury duty. While employers are not required to pay employees for jury duty leave, they must allow employees to fulfill this duty without penalty or retaliation. Still, some employers choose to offer paid leave as a benefit. The employee handbook or employment contract typically outlines the decision to offer paid jury duty leave. The court compensates jurors in North Carolina. The compensation is $12 for the first day of service and $20 for each subsequent day. If a juror serves for more than five days, the compensation increases to $40 each day after the fifth day. Community Service Leave Community service leave in North Carolina is only available to state employees. It gives them time off for volunteering and community involvement. This leave is available to volunteer in schools, directly benefiting the educational process for students. State employees can also use community service leave to participate in volunteer activities that support community service organizations or programs and attend parent-teacher conferences or educational activities for their children. The community service leave available to state employees is up to 24 hours per calendar year for full-time employees and none for part-time employees. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave or funeral leave is the time off that allows employees to grieve the loss of a loved one and manage the arrangements surrounding a death. North Carolina has no specific law requiring employers to provide bereavement leave. Generally, employers offer this benefit as part of their leave policies to support employees during difficult times. Bereavement leave policies in North Carolina, such as paid or unpaid leave, typically vary at the employer’s discretion. PTO Payout on Termination in North Carolina Employees often accrue unused vacation time at the end of their service, whether through resignation, retirement, or termination. Employers must understand how accruals and payouts of unused PTO are handled in North Carolina. In North Carolina, employers are not legally required to pay out accrued, unused vacation time upon termination unless their policies or employment contracts state otherwise. This is why employers must create clear payout policies or any specific agreements and communicate them to their employees. These policies should be outlined in the employee handbook or employment contract and must be consistently followed. Employers who promise to pay out accrued vacation time in writing or through consistent practice are generally obligated to fulfill this promise. How can Truein help with Paid time off management?

Washington state PTO laws are shaped by federal and state regulations, providing employees access to various leave types, including vacation, sick leave, and special-purpose leaves. WA PTO laws serve the dual purpose of protecting employee welfare and fostering a productive and healthy workforce. If you run a business in Washington or operate in the state, this guide will help you explore the various aspects of PTO in Washington and highlight the federal regulations, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Table of Contents FMLA Federal Law followed in Washington Maternal and Paternal Leave Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act Child Care Leave Family Illness Leave Paid Time Off in Washington Paid Leaves in Washington Sick Leave Seattle’s Paid Sick and Safe Time (PSST) Tacoma’s Paid Sick Leave Washington State Family and Medical Leave Parental Leave Organ Donorship Leave Vacation Leave Military Leave Voting Leave in Washington Jury Duty Leave Community Service Leave Bereavement Leave Domestic Violence Leave Employers' Responsibilities for Implementing a Paid Sick Leave Policy and Requirements Payout Requirements on Termination in Washington How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion FMLA Federal Law followed in Washington The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law that applies nationwide, including to all employers in Washington. It applies to employers with 50 or more employees. Under FMLA, all eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year for specific family and medical reasons. FMLA is an umbrella provision that includes maternal and paternal leave, protections under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, child care leave, and family illness leave. To be eligible for FMLA, employees must: Work for an employer with 50 or more employees. This includes public agencies, schools, and private-sector employers. Have worked for the employer for at least 12 months. Have at least 1,250 hours of service over the past 12 months. Work at a location with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. There are certain leaves included within FMLA: Maternal and Paternal Leave Employers must offer eligible employees maternal or paternal time off for a child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement. Employees take maternal/paternal leave within one year of the child’s birth or placement, and it can be taken intermittently or as a continuous block of time. Under this provision, parents can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off for prenatal care, pregnancy complications, childbirth, and recovery or adoption or welcome a child into foster care. Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The act mandates that no employer can treat a pregnant employee unfavorably regarding hiring, firing, promotions, job assignments, or benefits. It also has provisions for reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees, such as light duty or temporary reassignment, similar to employees with other medical conditions. The Pregnancy Disability Act requires employers to provide employees with pregnancy-related disabilities the same benefits as those with other temporary disabilities. This includes access to sick leave, modified work duties, or other reasonable accommodations. Child Care Leave FMLA also covers child care leave, allowing parents to take time off to care for a child with a serious health condition. As per FMLA, serious health is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. Family Illness Leave In Washington, all employers must offer paid family and medical leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition. This provision recognizes the importance of family support during medical crises and gives employees the flexibility to fulfill their caregiving responsibilities. Under this provision, an employee can take family illness leave for immediate family members, including: Spouses: Legal spouses, including same-sex spouses. Children: Biological, adopted, or foster children, stepchildren, legal wards, or children for whom the employee stands in loco parentis (acting as parents). Parents: Biological, adoptive, step, or foster parents, or individuals who stood in loco parentis to the employee as a child. Employers don’t have to bear the cost of this paid vacation as a state fund funds it. Employers pay 27.24%, and employees pay 72.76% of the contribution to the fund. However, smaller businesses (with less than 50 employees) are not required to pay the premium; the state contributes its share. Paid Time Off in Washington Washington does not have a mandatory paid time off provision, and policies regarding it are at employers’ discretion. The accrual systems and roll-over policies for these types of leave vary depending on the employer and the type of leave. Employers in Washington are under no legal obligation to use an accrual system for PTO. They allow employees to earn a certain amount of leave based on their length of service or hours worked, which depends on their policies. Some employers also use a fixed accrual rate per pay period, such as a certain number of hours for every week or month worked, which ensures that employees steadily accumulate leave. Washington is among the states that allow a use-it-or-lose-it policy. This means employers have no obligation to allow employees to roll over unused PTO from one year to the next. Still, many employers allow the rollover of accrued PTO as a benefit. The roll-over policy varies by employer and is often outlined in the employee handbook or employment contract. Paid Leaves in Washington Washington has established several paid leave laws that benefit employees, covering situations like sickness, family care, and medical emergencies. Employers in the state should be aware of the paid leaves they must provide their employees for compliance. Sick Leave FMLA applies to all employers and provides employees with the right to up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. Washington has paid sick leave laws throughout the state. However, the cities of Seattle and Tacoma have their policies. Under Washington’s paid sick leave law, employees earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked. Employers can use the paid sick time for their illness, injury, health condition, or a family member. It can also be used for time off to deal with domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Additionally, employers must allow employees to carry over up to 40 hours of unused paid sick leave into the following year. Seattle’s Paid Sick and Safe Time (PSST) Seattle has the Paid Sick and Safe Time (PSST) ordinance, which applies to employers with employees who work within Seattle city limits. Under the PSST provision, the amount of paid sick leave accrual varies based on the employer’s size. All employers with up to 49 employees must provide one hour of leave for every 40 hours worked. They must allow a maximum accrual of 40 hours per year. Employers with 50 to 249 employees must provide one hour of PSST for every 40 hours worked. Such employees can accrue up to 56 hours annually. Employers with 250 or more employees must provide one hour of leave for every 30 hours worked, with a maximum accrual of 72 hours annually. PSST covers absences covered under Washington paid sick law, including illness, health conditions, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Tacoma’s Paid Sick Leave Employers in Tacoma must provide paid sick leave to their employees who work more than 80 hours in a year. According to Tacoma’s paid sick leave law, employees earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked, up to a maximum accrual of 24 hours annually. Employees can carry over 40 hours of unused leave into the following year. Washington State Family and Medical Leave Washington’s Family Leave Insurance program, also known as Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML), provides paid leave benefits for family and medical reasons. Under this program, all eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of paid leave annually. PFML can be used for: Bonding with a newborn or newly placed child. Caring for a family member with a serious health condition. Recovering from the employee’s serious health condition. Dealing with a military exigency arising from a family member’s deployment. The PFML benefits can be extended up to 16 weeks if there are more than one qualifying family and medical reasons. It can be up to 18 weeks of paid leave for female employees who face pregnancy complications that result in incapacity. The Washington Family Care Act is another provision that protects the rights of employees for paid sick time off to take care of their children, a spouse or domestic partner, a parent/ parent-in-law, or a grandparent. Parental Leave Under Washington’s PFML program, new parents are allowed to take paid parental leave for the birth or placement of a child. This leave is available to mothers and fathers, supporting bonding and family well-being. All parents can take up to 12 weeks time off in the first year after child’s birth or placement under parental leave. Organ Donorship Leave Executive agencies in Washington must provide paid organ donorship leave for employees who donate an organ or bone marrow. Private employers have no obligation, and it depends on their company policies to offer leave for donorship. Organ donorship leave allows state employees to take up to 7 days of paid time off for bone marrow donation and up to 30 days of paid leave for organ donation. Vacation Leave No federal or state law in Washington requires employers to offer paid vacation time to employees. The decision is at the employer’s discretion. While no state law requires employers to provide vacation leave, many employers offer this benefit to attract and retain employees. Military Leave Military leave in Washington is governed by the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and the local state law. Under USERRA, employees can take up to 5 years of unpaid time off for active service in the military. Employees are obligated to provide time off for military service. Also, such employees must continue to receive group health coverage for up to 24 months. Washington’s state law protects employees who are reservists or members of the National Guard. Voting Leave in Washington Employers in Washington are not obligated to provide time off, paid or unpaid, for voting. However, most employers still allow time for employees who do not get enough time outside work hours to vote. Jury Duty Leave Jury duty is an important civic responsibility, and Washington protects employees called to serve as jurors. The state requires employers to provide unpaid leave for jury duty. The duration of the leave can be as long as the duty requires. Employees do not have to pay for jury duty leave, as the court pays jurors $10 a day. Community Service Leave Private employers are not required to offer community service leave. However, all state employers must. State employees can use community service leave to participate in community-building activities and assistance responsibilities. Bereavement Leave There is no federal or state law on bereavement leave in Washington. Employers can provide paid or unpaid bereavement leave to employees in difficult times at their sole discretion. Domestic Violence Leave Victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking can ask for domestic violence leave without any fear of retaliation from their employers. Domestic violence leave can be counted against paid time off or unpaid. Affected employees can use domestic violence leave for: Legal or law enforcement assistance and court proceedings Seeking psychological and medical help Assistance from social service programs Plan for their safety Relocating Employers' Responsibilities for Implementing a Paid Sick Leave Policy and Requirements Employers must create comprehensive policies to ensure transparency and compliance with the implementation of the paid sick leave policy. The policies must be communicated with the employees. Here are the details to include: Accrual Rates How employees can use paid sick leave Carryover details and how to apply for roll-over All existing and new policies must meet the minimum requirements of state laws or local ordinances. Even if you do not have a written paid sick leave policy in place, you must meet the minimum state requirement, which is providing one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked to all eligible employees. In addition to comprehensive policies, employees should ensure accurate accrual tracking using tools like Truein. Employers in Washington must also maintain detailed records of paid sick leave and report this information as required by the state. Payout Requirements on Termination in Washington Washington has no laws on PTO payouts upon termination from service, whether through resignation or retirement. Employers are not legally required to pay out accrued, unused vacation time upon termination unless their policies or employment contracts state otherwise. Employers must maintain clear policies regarding the payout of accrued, unused vacation upon termination to avoid misunderstandings and potential disputes.
