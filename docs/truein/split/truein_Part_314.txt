It’s not the holiday season, so customers take their time during the day, mostly empty chairs. What will be the impression on customers when they walk in? Will they be greeted by a diligent staff member committed to customer experience or welcomed by bored, too-lazy-to-work staff with a lot of time to kill? It depends on what kind of customer experience you will create by optimizing your workforce and improving operational efficiency. For businesses like retail and restaurants, typical 8 or 12-hour shifts are not beneficial in covering the operations and providing the best customer experience. The solution is to use split shift, which allows businesses to chunk the shifts into two or three blocks while the total shift time still adds up to 8 hours per day. This article provides a comprehensive overview of split shift schedules, exploring their definition, characteristics, and how they work in various industries.

How Split Schedule Rules Vary Geographical How Truein Helps with Employee Shift Scheduling Conclusion What is a Split Shift Schedule? A split shift schedule is a work arrangement where an employee’s daily work hours are divided into two or more separate periods. There’s a break of several hours between the periods, and this break is often referred to as a “split.” A split schedule typically breaks between work periods ranging from a few hours to several hours, depending on the organization’s needs and the employee’s role. To illustrate this concept, let’s consider two examples from different industries: In the restaurant industry, the waiting staff is often given split shift hours to ensure coverage during busy periods. For example, their first shift could start at 11 am and end at 2 pm to cover the busy lunch period. After a three-hour break, the servers would return for their second shift from 5 pm to 10 pm, covering the dinner rush. Similarly, a retail store employee might also work a split shift schedule. For example, they could work from 9 am to 1 pm, helping with store opening, stocking shelves, and assisting customers during the morning hours. Then, there can be a few hours break before the employee returns for an evening shift from 5 pm to 9 pm. Such split shifts enable businesses to have sufficient staff during the busiest times of the day while allowing the employees some time off in the afternoon. The key characteristics of a split shift schedule include: Divided work hours: Unlike other shifts here, the employee’s daily work hours are split into two or more segments, with a significant gap between each segment. Extended break periods: In split shifts, the breaks between shifts are typically longer than a standard lunch break. Longer breaks provide employees more time to rest, run errands, or attend to personal matters. Flexibility: Split shifts allow organizations to schedule employees during peak hours and adjust staffing levels according to business needs, ensuring optimal coverage and efficiency. Unlike traditional 9-to-5 schedules, there is no continuous 8-hour shift with a short lunch break. Also, split shifts typically involve working two or more shifts within the same day, with a significant break between shifts. Unlike rotating shifts, this requires employees to work during the day and evenings. How Does a Split Shift Work? Split shift is designed to cover the most critical operation hours of the business while providing employees time off during slow hours. The aim here is to maintain adequate staffing levels during critical periods while providing businesses with a more efficient utilization of their human resources and a more flexible work schedule. For example, nursing staff is often given split shifts in the healthcare industry. For instance, a nurse working a split shift might start their day at 7 am and work until 11 am, covering the morning rush. They would then have a break from 11 am to 3 pm, allowing them to rest, run errands, or attend to personal matters. The nurse would return to work at 3 pm and continue their shift until 7 pm, covering the afternoon and early evening hours when the hospital experiences another peak inpatient needs. Which Industries should consider using Split Shifts? Several industries can benefit from split shift schedules, particularly those that experience fluctuations in demand or require extended hours of operation. Here are some of the industries that should consider using split shifts include Retail: In the retail industry, the peak hours are concentrated around specific day periods. For example, stores often experience peak customer traffic during particular hours, such as lunchtime or evening shopping. A split schedule is beneficial for such stores.

Types of Split Shift Schedules Depending on the requirements of the business operations, employers can choose from several types of split shift schedules. Here are the most commonly implemented types of split shift schedules: Morning-Afternoon Split: Most familiar in the education and daycare sector, this split shift requires employees to work a few hours in the morning, take a break, and then return for an afternoon shift.

Weekday-Weekend Split: Employees work split shifts during weekdays and have different weekend schedules. Peak Hours Split: Employees work split shifts covering peak business hours, such as lunchtime and dinner rushes in a restaurant. Overnight Split Shifts: Employees work split shifts that cover overnight hours, typically used in 24/7 operations like hospitals or security firms.
