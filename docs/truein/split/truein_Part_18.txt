We’ve helped construction companies get over their biggest bane with a practical solution, especially designed for them. Table of Contents The current attendance scenario in the construction industry 1. Buddy punching: 2. Manual errors: 3. Reconciliation pain: How can construction industry have better attendance monitoring? 1. Portability: 2. No proxy: 3. Fast onboarding: 4. Geo-fencing: Testimonial from a leading construction brand Read more: The current attendance scenario in the construction industry Construction companies would agree that there are no fixed sites. New sites come up and old ones close down all too often. It is not practical to install machines to track attendance. Manual attendance by the security guard is the most common practice. The result? 1. Buddy punching: Who is signing attendance for whom? Nobody would ever know. The actual site may have ten people, but the company may be paying for twelve. Small leakages like these in the contract labour attendance system can result in big cheques and losses eventually. It can also have legal and security implications too as there is no real way of knowing who you are employing. 2. Manual errors: Even in a perfect world where everyone is honest and truthful at attendance time, there is scope for mistakes. There can be date errors or spelling errors. Contract labour may not be educated enough to realize it and it may go completely unnoticed. 3. Reconciliation pain: Manual attendance at the end of the day, week or month has to be converted into excels for payroll processing. It can be many days of unproductive work, further prone to errors. How can construction industry have better attendance monitoring? Truein face attendance app is one with many solutions for the construction industry. Let’s break it down for simplicity. 1. Portability: Your sites keep changing so you don’t have to invest in attendance infrastructure. Install any temporary stand to hold a tablet at the gate and let workers simply walk in using face attendance. Don’t have a closed gated site? Truein face attendance needs no hardware. It works on any Android or iOS mobile too. The security guard can be given a mobile to take face attendance of contract workers on site. 2. No proxy: What you see is what you get! A face recognition-based system cannot be fudged or overridden. Besides, Truein works in the most complex scenarios too: Construction site has low-light or works in night shift? Our system works. Construction site is in a remote location with no internet? Truein works offline too. Truein works practically hundred percent of times so there is no scope for parallel systems like manual registers. 3. Fast onboarding: When you have contract staff that keeps changing every day, you cannot afford to have a slow or long onboarding system. How about a one-click system? The new joinee captures his face from the kiosk or mobile and his onboarding is completed. Every other detail like reporting manager, contractor agency, shift assignment etc. can be managed in our web dashboard later. 4. Geo-fencing: If you want to restrict the attendance of a worker to one site, you can do that using our technology. We allow you to fence the attendance by marking the GPS location. He can mark his attendance only within those geographical boundaries. All entries get stamped with location and time, so you have a verifiable audit trail at all times. Practically no-fuss, quick and accurate system is what we have to offer. What’s more? We have clients in the construction industry who have used our system for more than four years at multiple sites on a large scale. Tried and tested? You got it! Testimonial from a leading construction brand Girish Nambalkar from SJ Contracts says, “Using a face attendance system at construction sites was a big challenge. Team Truein calmly understood our requirement and provided required customization too. Truein is an excellent solution. As of today, we are using Truein attendance system at our 22 sites. We found that Truein is more user-friendly and easier to use. The required reports ae also generated by the individual users irrespective of his location.” “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Read more: How geo-fencing takes touchless attendance to the next level?

Similarly, the marketing staff has to do market visits or go for meetings at agency offices. Rarely does the sales or marketing team report to head office for attendance. More often than not, there is a manual attendance register that gets reconciled at month-end. In other cases, the managers receive out-of-office request emails from their subordinates and the manager has to manually override absent marks in the system. Either ways, it is a painful exercise. FMCG companies have figured an easier way to overcome this issue. What did they do? Table of Contents 1. Embrace face attendance: 2. Allow selfie-based attendance: 3. Take advantage of geo-fencing: 4. Rely on system stamps: 5. Create a unified system: Key learnings from FMCG 1. Embrace face attendance: Face attendance is the only form of attendance that cannot be fudged or misused. Card based attendance can invite proxies as workers do buddy punching . Thumb based attendance is known to have recognition issues which give rise to parallel systems like manual registers. Face attendance, especially on reliable systems like Truein, works with practically 100% accuracy. No misrepresentation. FMCG companies have built trust and reliability within their sales departments with the power of face attendance. 2. Allow selfie-based attendance: Large FMCG companies have given up the idea of calling the sales team to head office for attendance. It is not practical and it is not productive. They have placed an attendance system in every salespersons’ palm. Sales people simply download the Truein app and turn their very own mobiles into attendance systems. They can upload their attendance selfies and register attendance from wherever they are – on field, at agency office or in market. 3. Take advantage of geo-fencing: Companies have marked territories by defining GPS boundaries in the Truein face attendance system . Sales and marketing staff can take selfie attendance from wherever they are, as long as they fall within the approved geography. So a sales person can’t log attendance from home. He has to be at a specific location which need not be the head office. It can be the distributor’s office, geo-fenced by their HR team. Geo-fencing lets companies adapt progressive policies like ‘anywhere attendance’ without worrying about misuse. 4. Rely on system stamps: Can employees change their device time and location to manipulate attendance stamps? No way. Companies that have implemented the Truein way of attendance know that the system is robust. The system stamps take only the server time and cannot be played around with. All time and location stamps are preserved, creating a robust audit trail. Sales and marketing staff can be made accountable and can be questioned if the records look suspicious. 5. Create a unified system: The biggest reason why some FMCG companies have been able to overcome the age-old attendance problem is through their reliance on forward-looking technology. They cut down the parallel systems like manual registers or email approvals completely. They use Truein as the single-source of truth for all attendance related matters. Truein is used for all of the following: Marking attendance on kiosk or employee mobiles Sending leave requests and approving them Managing shifts Managing employee overtime policy and calculating overtime hours and other compliances When there is a single unified system, it is easy to manage massive records and there is no need for manual reconciliations. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Key learnings from FMCG When you are dealing with a large workforce that works from out-of-office, you need the power of automation . Manual registers won’t do. There has to be a balance of freedom and compliance. Employees are less stressed out and yet the company has audit trails. It is important to work with proven technologies like Truein and overcome many problems in one clean shot.
