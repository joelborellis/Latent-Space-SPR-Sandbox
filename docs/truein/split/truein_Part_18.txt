How Truein helped Supply Chain & Logistics Industry Companies H S Supply Chain, a logistics company, uses Truein to manage their contract staffat 50+ sites centrally and maximize staff productivity and utilization. 50+Sites 4K Staff H S Supply Chain had diverse attendance processes across their sites, making attendance capturing and tracking tedious. Staff onboarding was challenging as they had contract staff, most of whom changed daily. The number of staff required at the sites also varied every day. Further, the company had a policy of procuring only a fixed number of staff members from a contractor agency. Accurate time calculations, including overtime policies, were one of the major challenges.

Site-level and contractor-level attendance limit features ensured that the correct number of staff was supplied to the sites. Real-time centralized dashboard enabled site and category-wise view of their staff. Customized reports and analytics helped the management to make the right decision on staff planning and forecast.
