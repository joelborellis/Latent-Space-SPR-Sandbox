What is employee Offboarding? Offboarding is the set of procedures and considerations to manage an employee’s departure to ensure that employees part ways with a positive impression. It is also essential to preserve a company’s reputation by ensuring employees leave professionally and respectfully. An effective employee offboarding process involves more than returning company property and revoking the employee’s access. This article explores the essential tips and best practices for an effective offboarding process. 10 Tips for setting up an effective Employee Exit Process 1. Ensure a concise and timely communication HR managers responsible for employee offboarding should facilitate open and timely communication for employees leaving the company. Ensure the person knows what comes next when they decide to leave the company. Start with an initial meeting to discuss the resignation, the expectations, and the timeline. The initial conversation is essential to let the employee know there is no hostility and clearly outline what they should do, such as return the company property and complete exit interviews. Throughout the employee offboarding process, open communication matters. Additionally, all the relevant teams, such as HR, and the employee’s manager, must be involved in the communications. 2. Ensure the right documentation The employee offboarding process can only be seamless with proper documentation. There are far more documents than just a resignation letter for finalizing the process. To make offboarding easier, ensure all necessary paperwork is completed correctly, including payroll, benefits, and tax documents. Ensure that your employee is compensated correctly. For example, make sure that the employee is paid for the time-off balance and for holidays that need to be paid-off. You can easily get access to an employee’s time-off balance by using time and attendance software like Truein. It keeps a record of employee’s time-off balance and auto-syncs the time-off data with your payroll and HRMS software. Furthermore, update employee contracts, sign non-disclosures, and provide a checklist of items they must return, such as laptops, access cards, and company vehicles. You can also incorporate an option to obtain electronic signatures on exit documents to make the offboarding process easier for both parties. Workforce management software facilitates this requirement of the offboarding process. 3. Ensure knowledge transfer and succession planning Your employees develop unique insights into institutional functions that can serve your company tremendously if transferred to replacements. Knowledge transfer and succession planning are essential for the continuity of projects and facilitate the smooth transition of responsibilities to other team members. The replacement might need formal training sessions, documentation of procedures, or mentorship from departing employees. Make sure you are facilitating the knowledge transfer through succession planning. This will include identifying the critical skills and expertise needed for the role and creating a plan to promote such knowledge transfer. 4. Conduct exit interviews Exit interviews are compelling tools that provide valuable insights into your company’s strengths and highlight the areas for improvement. Providing a secure and confidential setting for exit interviews facilitates candid conversations. It encourages department employees to share honest feedback about their experiences with the company. Analyzing the conversation, you can identify patterns and make necessary changes to improve the employee experience. Exit interviews during the employee offboarding can be conducted in person, over the phone, or through surveys. 5. Secure property and revoke access A prominent concern during the offboarding process is the security and integrity of the information and resources. Immediately suspending the departing employee’s access to all critical and sensitive company systems, accounts, and databases is necessary for preventing unauthorized access or potential data breaches. Abrupt termination of access can seem hostile. That’s why your IT department should communicate the protocol regarding deactivating accounts and changing access permissions to departing employees. Also, Truein’s workforce management features can help identify with accurate working hour calculations. It is a cloud-based time and attendance tracking software that automatically marks employees inactive if they are not using time tracking in Truein. It is advantageous if your company hires contractors frequently. A contract worker could be left within the employee pool without concern for false pay because they will be counted as billable users only if their status is ‘active.’ Additionally, all company property, such as laptops, mobile devices, and access cards, should be collected to minimize the risk of lost or stolen items. 6. Ensure there is no loss of productivity Department of employees – sudden or planned – affects the productivity of teams. The tasks and projects such an employee is responsible for can come to a halt. It would help if you delegated to ensure no disruptions to ongoing projects and operations. Identify the individuals or teams who can temporarily take over the responsibilities of the departing employee’s role. Keep open communication with the other employees about the transition and what change in responsibilities they can anticipate. The ideal way to ensure no loss of productivity when an employee resigns is to promote cross-training. It will ensure that team members are versatile and can handle additional tasks. 7. Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements A delicate part of employee offboarding is legal and regulatory compliance. To avoid potential legal issues and maintain your organization’s reputation, following local and federal labor laws guidelines is mandatory. Always provide written notices outlining the rights and responsibilities of the departing employee, such as policies about the return of company property, final paychecks, and any benefits changes. Discuss and review any non-compete or confidentiality agreements with them to ensure they understand their obligations and legal restrictions once they leave the company. Finally, accurately calculate and disburse the departing employee’s final paycheck. Again, Truein can be a valuable tool as it accurately monitors and calculates work hours and shares data with the payroll software. 8. Celebrate employee contributions and organize a farewell Employee offboarding is an opportunity for a company to showcase departing employees and how their hard work and expertise have impacted the company. Celebrating their contributions with a proper farewell leaves a positive last impression and helps maintain goodwill. Organizing a farewell is a small token of appreciation that allows employees to part ways with a sense of recognition and warmth. Ultimately, celebrating employee contributions as a last step of the employee offboarding process makes them potential ambassadors of your brand. 9. Stay in touch Human resources are valuable, particularly employees with the right talent and skills. Preserving ties with departing employees can serve well in the long run. Encourage communication between ex-employees and current workers through various mediums, such as social media platforms. Do not turn into a hostile environment that deters current employees from staying in touch with former workers. You can also organize alumni networking events to allow former employees to keep in touch with each other and the organization. 10. Integrate continuous improvement in the offboarding process Effective employee offboarding is dynamic and must evolve with the changing work culture. It is essential to keep improving the offboarding process through exit interviews to ensure any negative patterns are identified and corrected. Periodically review your company’s employee offboarding process to align it with changing employee expectations, current best practices, legal requirements, and organizational needs. Some best practices can ensure that your employee offboarding process is a smooth process and lead to a positive experience for both the departing employee and your organization. Here are the do’s and don’ts to consider for the employee offboarding process. Do's of Employee Offboarding 1. Start the employee offboarding process when they announce their departure to allow time for a well-organized transition and knowledge transfer. 2. Maintain a professional environment for the employee irrespective of the circumstances of the departure. Your employees deserve kindness and professionalism. 3. Communicate the departure with the rest of the team. Maintain open and honest communication with the rest of the team and discuss expectations and timelines about changes in responsibilities. 4. Maintain a positive relationship with departing employees. It will serve the company in the long run, leading to potential rehiring, referrals, and continued goodwill. 5. Be aware of knowledge transfer, as it can disrupt workflow and productivity. Facilitate training, onboarding, and mentoring to ensure critical information is handed over appropriately. 6. Take advantage of exit interviews, as they provide valuable feedback. Use the departing employee’s perspective to understand your organization’s strengths and weaknesses. Don'ts of Employee Offboarding 1. Don’t burn bridges with messy employee offboarding. Departing employees can become vendors, clients, or boomerang employees. You must avoid hostile or adversarial interactions during the offboarding process. 2. Refrain from believing that the employment rules and laws you know will apply in every country. Each jurisdiction has laws and regulations, so you must consult professionals.

There are diverse types of employment arrangements available that you can choose from as per your specific needs. Full-time, part-time, or temporary workers-there are various ways employees can be engaged in the workforce. The need for considering the different types of employment arises from the fact that such a decision significantly impacts an organization’s operations, costs, and flexibility. Here, we explore 12 types of employment, highlighting their needs and how businesses should decide on the most suitable type. Table of Contents 12 Types of Employment 1. Full-time employment 2. Part-time employment 3. Apprenticeship 4. Traineeship 5. Internship 6. Casual employment 7. Employment on commission 8. Contract employment 9. Probation 10. Seasonal employment 11. Leased employment 12. Contingent employment How should businesses decide on employment type? How can Truein help businesses? Conclusion 12 Types of Employment 1. Full-time employment The most common type of employment is full-time arrangement. Full-time employees are hired to typically work a standard 35-40 hours per week and have a regular schedule and consistent pay. Such employees are provided the usual work benefits such as health insurance, paid time off, and retirement plans. Almost every business requires a certain number of permanent employees to ensure that operations run smoothly, as other types of employees can join and leave the workforce regularly. Full-time employment should be offered for positions requiring commitment, consistent presence, and long-term investment in the company. 2. Part-time employment Part-time employment allows workers to work fewer hours than full-time staff and often has flexible schedules. Part-time employees are hired to meet demands outside the constant workflow. For instance, retailers employ part-time workers to meet increased demand during peak season. Such employees are paid on a pro-rata basis, and they may or may not receive benefits. Businesses that need flexibility in staffing should consider part-time employees as it helps companies manage labor costs more efficiently. You can easily adapt to varying workloads if you allow part-time opportunities. For candidates, this type of employment provides an opportunity to balance work with other commitments, such as education or family responsibilities. 3. Apprenticeship Apprenticeship is the type of employment suitable for people new to trade industries. Companies offer apprenticeships to workers through structured training programs under experienced professionals. It is one of the types of jobs that combines on-the-job learning with formal education or classroom instruction. Apprenticeship is a win-win situation as it allows companies to mold candidates to their specific requirements while providing aspiring professionals a pathway to a promising career. 4. Traineeship Traineeships are very similar to apprenticeships, but they are of shorter duration and involve less formal education. This type of employment is suitable for companies that require employees for immediate, short-term needs as traineeship provides practical training in a shorter time frame. If you need help with skill gaps in the workforce and are looking for a quick solution, consider offering traineeship programs. Trainees can learn the skills on the job while contributing to the work during their training period. 5. Internship Internships are offered to entry-level professionals and students to gain practical experience in the fields that interest them. It is suitable for various industries and can include positions that provide temporary and unpaid employment, stipends, or college credit. Businesses offering internships benefit from tapping into the young talent pool and fresh perspectives. This type of employment serves as a talent pipeline for industries that require highly skilled employees. It allows companies to identify and hire the best interns for permanent roles. Companies globally use internships as part of their recruitment and training strategy to help potential talent understand their field and help them decide on their future career paths. 6. Casual employment All the different types of employment we discussed till now involve formal scheduling. Still, if your business has no fixed schedule or requires a commitment to regular work hours, the casual employment option is ideal for you. Typically, casual employees are hired as needed, and these positions are often temporary or short-term. Casual employees are offered different benefits and job security than full-time or part-time employees. Businesses with variable workloads or seasonal demands benefit from hiring casual workers, as it allows for flexibility in staffing. Industries like hospitality and retail commonly use this type of employment to meet frequent demand changes due to tourism or holiday seasons. 7. Employment on commission Employment on commission is entirely different from the 6 types of employment discussed above. This type of work arrangement allows companies to pay employees based on the sales or performance they generate. Job on commission is standard in sales and marketing roles. As these roles require employees to stay motivated to create revenue, establishing a direct incentive to achieve targets keeps them motivated to excel. For businesses, the advantage is they only pay when the employee delivers results. This type of employment minimizes fixed labor costs and aligns compensation with performance. 8. Contract employment Contract employment is common in IT, where individuals are hired for specific projects, tasks, or periods. Contract workers are not part of the traditional workforce and are commonly known as freelancers or independent contractors. Companies do not have to offer contractors benefits like health insurance or retirement plans. This works in favor of businesses as they have access to talent with specialized skills without the long-term commitment of hiring full-time staff. However, you should consider contract employment only if your projects have a clear scope; otherwise, you will be left paying for the long term. When used correctly, this type of employment allows companies to scale their workforce up or down as needed and manage costs more efficiently. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 9. Probation Probationary employment is often part of the full-time and refers to a trial period during which new hires are assessed for performance. It gives employers time to evaluate their performance and decide if they will fit within the organization. Probation periods can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the role’s responsibilities. Employees may not receive full benefits or job security during probation as the company evaluates their capabilities before committing long-term. Probationary employment is a standard practice across industries as it minimizes risks associated with hiring, ensuring that only candidates who are a good fit for the position are hired. 10. Seasonal employment Seasonal employment is a common practice in the retail sector, where businesses hire workers for specific periods during the year when demand for goods or services is high. Retail, agriculture, tourism, and event management industries rely on seasonal employees to ensure they can meet increased workloads during peak seasons. This type of employment offers varying roles, and employees often receive temporary employment contracts. Seasonal employment gives businesses the flexibility to adapt to cyclic demand fluctuations and is particularly necessary for small establishments that cannot afford long-term work engagements. 11. Leased employment Leased employment involves businesses working with third-party agencies, often known as staffing or leasing agencies, to hire and manage employees on their behalf. In this type of employment, the staffing agency is the legal employer of the workers. If you want to avoid handling payroll, benefits, HR administration, and other employment-related responsibilities of the workers, consider leased employment. It is common in manufacturing and construction industries as it can be cost-effective, taking on administrative burdens and allowing the client company to focus on its core operations. 12. Contingent employment Contingent employment encompasses diverse workers, from freelancers to non-permanent or temporary employees. Contingent employees often have complete control over the delivery of their work and file their taxes. By hiring contingent workers, businesses save on benefits, long-term commitments, and administrative overhead. How should businesses decide on employment type? For businesses, there are several types of employment to choose from. It gives them flexibility but challenges deciding which employment type to adopt. The decision depends on several factors, including the nature of the business, budget, and flexibility requirements. Fully remote businesses may benefit from hiring full-time remote employees as it will ensure they have a dedicated workforce available regardless of location. However, there may be better types of employment for bootstrapped startups that need to save money for sustainable progress. Such companies can consider interns or consultants for part-time work. If your business is project-based, you can rely on remote freelancers to take on the responsibilities requiring specialized skills. For labor-intensive businesses such as manufacturing and construction, a mix of part-time, full-time, and seasonal workers is ideal to meet the fluctuating demands. How can Truein help businesses?
