Maryland’s regulations on overtime pay are pivotal for employers to understand and comply with in 2024. According to Maryland labor law, employees are generally entitled to receive overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular hourly wage for hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. For employers, it is essential to fulfill this entitlement to overtime pay as it is a critical aspect of labor law that ensures fair compensation for employees working extended hours. We created this guide to help employers understand Maryland overtime laws and their implications to avoid potential legal complications. Table of Contents Maryland Minimum Wage Tipped Minimum Wage Subminimum wage Exceptions to minimum wage Payment laws Maryland living wage law Overtime Laws in Maryland Break laws Maryland breastfeeding laws Leave requirements Child labor laws Hiring laws Termination laws Discrimination laws Occupational safety Miscellaneous laws How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion Maryland Minimum Wage The Fair Wage Act of 2023 , passed by the General Assembly in May 2023, has significantly increased Maryland’s minimum wage by $15 per hour from January 1, 2024. The Fair Wage Act of 2023 expedited the planned increase set for January 1, 2025. The new act marks a substantial rise from the former rates of $13.50 per hour for larger employers with 15 or more employees and $12.80 for smaller businesses. However, the minimum wage for tipped employees remains unchanged at $3.63 per hour. Montgomery County has a distinction where employers with more than 50 employees should pay a minimum wage of $17 per hour. Also, in the country, tipped employees must be paid $4 per hour. Depending on the location of your business, compliance with these wage standards is critical to avoid legal liabilities, including treble damages and criminal penalties in some cases​. Tipped Minimum Wage A tipped employee works in an industry where they regularly and customarily receive tips amounting to $30 per month. As of 2024, Maryland’s tipped minimum wage is $3.63 per hour. This rate is applicable across the state, regardless of the employer’s size. No change is made to the tipped minimum wage under the Fair Wage Act of 2023. However, this minimum wage is applicable as long as the tipped employees earn at least $12.50 per hour, including tips. Subminimum wage In Maryland, employees under 20 can be paid the subminimum wage. Under these regulations, new employees under 20 can be paid a minimum wage of $4.25 for the first 90 days. Minimum Wage Regulation also states that full-time high school or college students can be paid a minimum wage of $10.63(no less than 85% of the regular minimum wage rate for up to 20 work hours per week). Exceptions to minimum wage Specific categories of employees are exempted from the minimum wage regulations. These exceptions include: Agricultural workers and some agricultural branches Food and drink establishments with annual earnings of less than $400,000. Outside salesmen Minors and volunteers in charitable, educational, and religious organizations Drive-in theatre workers Industries involved in the canning, freezing, and packing of fruits, vegetables, seafood, or poultry Employers in these sectors must familiarize themselves with the specific details of the federal and state minimum wage laws because, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), if an employee is subjected to federal and state minimum wage laws, then the employer must pay whichever is higher. Payment laws Maryland labor laws mandate that employers pay their employees at least twice a month on predetermined dates. Executive, professional, and administrative employees are exempted from this regulation and can be paid less frequently based on employment agreements. In June 2021, Maryland passed the Secure Maryland Wage Act, which increases the minimum wage for employees working in specific locations with heightened security interests, like Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and Pennsylvania Station. Employees working in these locations earn a minimum wage of $13.50 per hour, with annual increases. These changes address high turnover and attract more people to work as janitors, non-TSA security officers, ramp workers, ticker agents, etc. Maryland living wage law Maryland’s Living Wage Law is a notable regulation applied to all private businesses that contract with the state government. According to the law, employers working on state contracts must pay their employees a living wage above the standard minimum wage. The applicability of this law is based on the nature of the contract, specifically: Maryland living wage law applies to service contracts with the state valued at $100,000 or more. Employees who spend 50% of their time on government contracts. Employees not working on such projects are not eligible for higher wages. Additionally, the living wage varies by county. Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Baltimore, Howard, Montgomery, and Prince George’s counties provide a living wage rate of $14.55 per hour, while all other counties offer $10.93. Overtime Laws in Maryland Maryland has no specific overtime laws and applies federal Fair Labor Standards Act laws to all employers. Simply put, Maryland overtime laws mandate that all employers pay 1.5 times the regular wage for hours worked over 40 a week. It applies to all types of employment and industries, with some exceptions, including certain salaried employees, workers in specific care institutions, and recreational establishments. Employers must understand that Maryland overtime laws don’t recognize 8-hour per-day schedules for overtime. To be eligible for overtime pay, employees must have worked over 40 hours per week. Break laws Maryland has no laws for breaks, and it is solely on employers’ discretion to allow for such breaks. The only exception is for minor workers, who must be provided 30 minutes for every 5 hours worked. Still, most employers in the state provide rest and meal breaks to ensure a productive workforce. Employees who provide work and meal breaks must follow federal standards. Employers should compensate employees if they work through meal times, and if no work is performed during meal breaks, they can be unpaid. For retail establishments with 50 or more employees, the Maryland Healthy Retail Employee Act mandates certain breaks based on the length of the work shift. Employers should ensure compliance with these laws. Maryland breastfeeding laws No Maryland state laws for breastfeeding breaks exist. As a result, federal breastfeeding laws are applicable. All employers should provide non-exempt (hourly) employees reasonable break times for breastfeeding for up to one year after the child’s birth. As per federal standards, employers must provide a private space (other than a bathroom) for breastfeeding. However, there are no guidelines on the duration and frequency of these breaks. The employer can determine it. Furthermore, small businesses with fewer than 50 employees may be exempt from providing breastfeeding breaks and arrangements if they can demonstrate significant hardship. Leave requirements Maryland has a full spectrum of employee leave requirements, including required and non-required leaves. The state follows the Maryland Healthy Working Families Act and federal FLSA laws to ensure workers get enough leaves for work-life balance. Required leaves in Maryland Sick and family leave: Sick and family leave is mandatory in Maryland, and all employers are required to provide sick leave. As per the regulations, employer sick leave accrues at 1 hour for every 30 hours worked. As a result, employees can accrue up to 40 sick leave hours in a year. This leave allows employees to take time off for personal illness, to care for a sick family member, or parental leave related to the birth or adoption of a child. Employers with 15 or more employees must provide paid sick leave, while those with 14 or fewer employees should offer unpaid sick leave. Jury duty leave Federal as well as Maryland Code, Court and Judicial Proceedings provide legal protection for employees serving jury duty. Employees must be provided leave for jury duty without any hassle and should be reinstated when they return. Voting time leave During elections, employees in Maryland have the civil right to be granted time off to vote. Employers must provide 2 hours of paid voting time to ensure employees can fulfill their civic duty. However, employers can ask employees to provide proof of voting. Domestic violence or sexual assault leave This leave is for employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. It allows time off for medical care, legal proceedings, or dealing with the aftermath of such incidents. Employees can use their paid sick leave hours in these circumstances if they or a family member suffers from domestic or sexual violence or stalking. Emergency response leave Employees of emergency response teams such as the Civil Air Patrol, volunteer firefighters, or any civil defense organization are entitled to leave to respond to emergencies. No employer can take retaliatory actions such as demoting, cutting pay, or discharging such employees from their jobs. These employees are entitled to adequate time off as a response to emergency events declared by the Governor. For state employees, emergency response leave can be up to 15 days per year if certified American Red Cross volunteers and their services are needed for a Level 2 or higher-level disaster. Organ and bone donation leave Maryland requires that all private employers support charitable acts such as organ or bone marrow donation by ensuring employees can take the necessary time off for medical procedures and recovery. Private employees must be provided up to 60 days of unpaid leave for organ donations and 30 days for bone marrow donation. For state employees, the limit is 30 days for organ donations and 7 days for bone marrow donation. Military leave Maryland military law facilitates employees’ commitments to the National Guard or Reserves. Employers are required to provide 15 days of paid leave for deployment or military training. This leave is essential for allowing service members to fulfill their military obligations. Non-required leaves Non-required leaves can also be part of the employment contract. Such leaves are offered at the employer’s discretion and are not legally mandated. However, employers must communicate their leave policies to employees and administer them fairly and consistently to avoid potential disputes or legal challenges. Bereavement leave Employers can choose to provide unpaid time for employees to grieve and manage affairs following the death of a close family member. Vacation leave Vacation leave can be offered to improve work-life balance and offer employees a chance for rest and recovery. Holiday leave It recognizes federal and state holidays. While private employers are not legally required to do so, public employers must offer 11 paid holidays annually Child labor laws Maryland’s child labor laws regulate the employment of minors to ensure their safety and well-being. As per these laws, children under 14 are not permitted to work. For minors aged 14-17, certain restrictions apply: All minors between 14 and 17 must get a work permit from the Maryland Department of Labor . They can work 3 hours a day during a school day and 8 hours on non-school days. They can only work between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. except on Labor Day, when they can work until 9 p.m. For minors aged 16 and 17: They are also required to get work permits. Their work hours have fewer restrictions and depend on the nature of work. However, they must have 8 consecutive hours of rest per 24 hours for health and well-being. Additionally, no minor can be employed in prohibited occupations that include: Manufacturing plants related to explosives Logging, mining, or working with power-driven machinery Operating heavy machinery like lifts, elevators, etc. Machinery maintenance Blast furnaces Working at docks or railroads Driving motor vehicles Erection and repair of electrical components Distilleries Hiring laws Maryland’s hiring laws govern various aspects of the recruitment and hiring process, ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all job applicants. The state follows The Job Applicant Fairness Act that provides no candidate is discriminated against based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, religion, age, disability, and national origin. The act also prohibits employers from asking employees for credit reports to make hiring decisions. Termination laws In Maryland, termination laws are as per the “employment-at-will” doctrine. It allows either the employer or the employee to end the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, or no reason at all, as long as the termination is not illegal. However, this does not permit termination based on discriminatory or retaliatory reasons. Discrimination laws Maryland has a very robust anti-discrimination law to protect the rights of employees. No employer can have discriminatory practices based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or disability. The State of Maryland Commission on Civil Rights ensures equal employment opportunities. It protects workers from unfair treatment or biases in hiring, promotion, job assignments, termination, and other aspects of employment. Occupational safety Maryland follows the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) guidelines and state-specific regulations under Maryland Occupational Safety and Health (MOSH) . MOSH provides employers with resources that provide guidelines for on-site inspections, consultations, educational programs, and outreach to ensure workplace safety and health. The law focuses on setting and enforcing standards and collaborates with businesses to improve safety measures. Understanding and implementing these safety standards will help employers to provide a safe working environment and comply with legal requirements. Miscellaneous laws Maryland also has several miscellaneous labor laws that employers must be aware of. It includes: 1. Whistleblower protection laws : Maryland whistleblower laws apply to only public employees, and private employees are not protected under these laws. These regulations protect public employees from retaliation for reporting illegal activities such as mismanagement of public resources and violating laws. 2. Background check laws : Maryland is one of the states that follows the Ban the Box legislation, which restricts employers from asking about criminal history until the first in-person interview for companies with 15 or more employees. 3. Social media regulations : Maryland has the Username and Password Privacy Protection Law that ensures employers do not violate employee privacy rights. Employers can only ask for login details from employees to monitor or investigate employees’ work computers. 4. Drug and alcohol testing : There are several regulations regarding drug and alcohol testing in Maryland. Employers can discipline an employee for using Marijuana for medical purposes at work.

Sexual harassment training : Employers are encouraged or required to provide training to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. Additionally, Maryland’s anti-harassment training laws mandate that all public employees must undergo 2 hours of sexual harassment prevention training in the first six months of their service and then every two years. 6.

That’s why employers need to comply with the latest legal mandates. For any business, legal compliance with the New Jersey PTO laws is mandatory for compliance and fostering a positive workplace culture. We created this guide on New Jersey PTO law to help employers understand various regulations and stay abreast of any changes to ensure compliance and strategically manage employee leave. Table of Contents Paid Sick Leave Paid Vacation, Holiday, and Personal Time Laws Permitting Sick Time and Medical Leaves Jury Duty Leave Victims of Crimes Payments for Unused Time Off Rollover policy in New Jersey Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay NJ policy on payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination Bereavement Leave Military Leave Voting Leave State Holidays How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion Paid Sick Leave As of 2024, under the New Jersey PTO Law, paid sick leave is a mandatory provision employers must offer their employees. All employees in the state are entitled to accrue 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers can limit the yearly accumulated paid sick leave to 40 hours annually. The accrued paid sick leave can be used for various reasons besides the employee’s medical needs. It can be used for family illness, attending to matters related to domestic or sexual violence, and attending school meetings related to a child’s health or disability. Accrual of paid sick leave starts from the first day of employment. However, employers can put a waiting period of 120 days, after which new hires can use their accrued paid sick leave. Furthermore, employees can carry over 40 hours of unused paid sick leave from one year to the next. Employers are not required to pay for unused paid sick leave upon termination of an employee. For employers, this means implementing a system that accurately tracks employee hours and accrued sick leave. It’s vital to have clear policies that align with the state requirements, ensuring that employees know their entitlements and the process for availing of sick leave. Paid Vacation, Holiday, and Personal Time New Jersey has no laws mandating paid vacation, holiday, or personal time off. It is at the employer’s discretion to offer PTO. Typically, most organizations offer these benefits to attract and retain talent. If an employer in New Jersey decides to provide PTO, they must adhere to their established policies and procedures without any discrimination. Employers must define eligibility, accrual, and usage rules for PTO offerings in their employee handbooks, contracts, and offer letters. Any changes to these policies should be communicated effectively to all employees to prevent misunderstandings and potential legal issues. Laws Permitting Sick Time and Medical Leaves Several New Jersey PTO laws permit employees to take time off beyond standard sick leave, extending to broader medical leaves. Employers must know the various laws allowing employees time off for medical needs. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows all eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave to attend to health-related circumstances, such as caring for a family member with a severe health condition or bonding with a new child. These laws mandate job protection and can vary based on the employer’s size and the employee’s tenure and hours worked. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have worked with the current employer for at least one year or worked 1,250 hours the previous year. FMLA applies to all employers with 50 or more employees or employees working at a location where 50 or more workers work within a 75-mile radius. An employee can use FMLA sick leave for the employee’s serious health condition, the care of a family member with a serious health condition, or the birth or adoption of a child. New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) The New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) is another law that allows workers in the state to take time off for medical needs beyond paid sick leave. It is a crucial piece of legislation that provides eligible employees with job-protected leave to care for needy family members. To support the well-being of employees and their families, NJFLA ensures that workers can take time off to address significant family-related matters without fear of adverse employment actions. All employers with 30 or more employees must provide up to 12 weeks of time off within 24 months to eligible employees to care for an ill family member or bond with a child. To qualify for NJFLA, employees should have worked for their employer for at least 12 months and have accumulated at least 1,000 hours of work during the preceding 12-month period. Leave under NJFLA can be unpaid, paid, or both, depending on the employer’s policies. Jury Duty Leave In New Jersey, the law requires employers to provide unpaid time off for employees summoned to serve on a jury. While this leave is not compensated, employers are prohibited from penalizing or otherwise disadvantaging employees for fulfilling their civic duty. It is also necessary for employers to allow employees to return to their positions without any repercussions. While private employees are not required to pay employees for jury duty leave, public employees are paid depending on their employment policies. However, the state pays any employee serving as a juror in New Jersey $5.00 daily. Employers should have a clear policy regarding jury duty leave, which should be communicated in the employee handbook or through other internal communications. This policy should outline the process for employees to notify their employer of the need for jury duty leave and any documentation required. Victims of Crimes As of 2024, victims of crimes have the legal right to take up to 20 days under the New Jersey Security and Financial Empowerment Act (NJ SAFE Act) . This PTO is available for employees if they or a member of their immediate family is a victim of sexual assault or domestic violence. Employers should provide victims of crimes unpaid leave to participate in court proceedings related to the crime. Employers must allow this time off, recognizing the importance of an employee’s role in the judicial process and their need for recovery and support. Additionally, employers must be sensitive and discreet in handling such situations, ensuring confidentiality and understanding. Payments for Unused Time Off As of 2024, no New Jersey PTO law mandates employers to pay employees for unused time off, such as vacation days. The decision to pay for unused time off depends on the employer’s established policy or employment contract. If the employer’s policy or agreement includes such provisions, they are legally bound to honor them. If an employer offers payments for unused time off, they should have clear, written policies regarding the accrual, use, and payment of unused vacation time. These policies should be consistently applied and communicated to all employees to avoid potential disputes and ensure fairness. Rollover policy in New Jersey New Jersey allows a use-it-or-lose-it policy, meaning employers are not required to allow employees to carry over unused PTO from one year to the next. However, paid sick time up to 40 hours can be rolled over to the following year. The maximum limit that can be carried over and the specifics of these provisions can vary based on the employer’s policy. It’s essential for employers to clearly define their rollover policies in their employee handbooks, detailing how much leave can be carried over and any conditions or limitations associated with this process. Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay In New Jersey, paid time off is not considered as wages. Therefore, there are no statutory provisions to address vacation pay. However, labor laws stipulate that employers must adhere to their established policies or employment contracts if they offer vacation benefits. Employers should have comprehensive vacation pay policies to avoid misunderstanding or potential legal disputes, including how vacation time is accrued, used, and compensated upon termination or resignation. NJ policy on payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination As there is no legislation for payment of PTO in New Jersey, the payment of accrued, unused vacation upon termination is guided by the employer’s policy or employment agreement. If the employer’s policy states that employees are entitled to payment for unused vacation time at termination, they must adhere to the agreed terms of employment. Employers have no obligation to pay on termination without an established policy for payment of accrued, unused vacation. This makes it necessary that employers must ensure that policies regarding vacation pay upon termination are clearly stated and consistently applied. Bereavement Leave There is no provision to provide bereavement leave in New Jersey PTO law. Most employers offer this leave to employees to allow them enough time to grieve and deal with the loss of a family member. Employers need to consider the impact of bereavement leave on their workforce, and offering bereavement leave can be a significant aspect of supporting employees during difficult times. Military Leave A combination of federal and state laws governs military leave in New Jersey. The key federal law is the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which applies nationwide. USERRA ensures that individuals who serve or have served in the Armed Forces, Reserve, National Guard, or other uniformed services are not disadvantaged in their civilian careers and can return to their employment after their military service. Under USERRA, all employers should provide employees unpaid leave for military service for up to 5 years to serve in duty. Furthermore, such employees should be provided group healthcare benefits for up to 24 months. Employers must reemploy returning service members in the position they would have attained had they not been absent for military service, with the same seniority, status, pay, and other rights and benefits determined by seniority. In addition to the USERRA, state law further protects the rights of employees who take leave to serve active duty in the armed forces. However, it doesn’t protect individuals working in temporary positions. Military leave is unpaid under the federal and state laws. Employees are protected from termination except for cause for one year after their reinstatement if their military service was for more than 180 days. The protection lasts for six months for service between 31 and 180 days. Voting Leave Voting leave is not required by law in New Jersey. It depends on employers’ policies to allow employees to fulfill their civic duty during work hours. Still, most employers in New Jersey provide time off for employees who need more time outside of working hours to vote. Any time off for voting is unpaid and depends on the employer’s discretion. Employers should promote civic participation while balancing the operational needs of their business. Being supportive of employees’ voting rights can also positively reflect on the company’s commitment to civic responsibilities and employee well-being. State Holidays New Jersey has 13 recognized state holidays, but private employees are not obligated to provide paid or unpaid holidays. However, public employees should be given holidays on officially recognized days. Here are the state holidays for 2024: Holiday Observed in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Presidents Day Monday, February 19 3rd Monday in February Good Friday Friday, March 29 2 days before Easter Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Juneteenth (!)
