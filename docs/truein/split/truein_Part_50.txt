Holiday Pay Calculator: How To Calculate Holiday Pay For Hourly Employees? July 23, 2024 Holidays are the time to rejoice with family and friends. However, it is uncertain for businesses as not all companies have the luxury of closing on holidays like Christmas, and Independence Day. The complication arises when you have to decide the holiday schedule and how the compensation should be decided for these days. Whether employees not working on holidays must be paid or those working on holidays should be given extra compensation are some of the complicated cautions regarding calculating holiday pay for hourly employees. As holiday pay is usually at the employer’s discretion, there is no one-fit-for-all solution to calculate holiday pay. To decide how much, if anything, to pay workers who work or don’t work on holidays, you must understand certain holiday pay calculation practices. This article will discuss what holiday pay is and how to calculate holiday pay for salaried employees and hourly workers. Table of Contents What is holiday pay? Who is eligible for holiday pay? How do you calculate holiday pay for hourly employees? The calculation of holiday pay for hourly employees How to calculate holiday pay for salaried employees? 4 Benefits of providing holiday pay to employees 1. Helps to increase productivity 2. Employees can work overtime 3. Employees will get paid on a day off 4. The reward for their work Conclusion What is holiday pay? While it sounds extraordinary, holiday pay is simply the compensation workers get for working or not working during public holidays. Many companies provide holiday pay as a gift to employees so they can take time off during holidays and spend it with their family and loved ones without losing pay. It is a gesture that directly affects employee satisfaction and the bond between employers and employees. It is also one of the motivations for retaining the workforce. Calculating holiday pay for hourly employees depends on the rules and regulations around holidays in the country of your business setup. In the United States, holiday pay is typically 1.5 times the worker’s average pay. It implies that the workers are paid the regular rate +1/2 of their standard rate for each work hour on holiday. Several private and public companies offer holiday bonus checks or paid time off during holidays. There are no laws in the United States that mandate that employees must be paid on holidays, but commonly employs a key one off with pay on the following holidays: Christmas Day Christmas Eve Easter Independence Day Labor Day Memorial Day New Year’s Day Thanksgiving Day The day after Thanksgiving (Black Friday) Public employers in the United States are required to observe the following ten federal holidays: New Year’s Day Martin Luther King Jr. Day George Washington’s birthday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Columbus Day Veterans Day Thanksgiving Day Christmas Day According to a report from the Society for Human Resource Management, 96% of private employers provide holiday pay to their workers . In India, the holidays are declared under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1981. Under this act, three mandatory national holidays with pay must be observed across all public and private sector companies. These are: 26th January (Republic Day) 15th August (Independence Day) 2nd October (Gandhi Jayanti) National and Festival Holiday Act rules the holiday pay rule applied by states locally. While the holidays declared under this act apply to government departments, banks, factories, and other establishments usually do not adopt the same. It is at the discretion of the employers to allow workers to take time off or pay them special compensation for all other holidays. Who is eligible for holiday pay? Holiday pay is unique because it usually doesn’t consider the worker’s employment status. Salaried and hourly paid employees who work on an annual or a local holiday are eligible for holiday pay. The onus is on HR managers to calculate holiday pay for salaried employees or hourly workers based on the company policies. While there is no provision to pay more than the regular pay rate to eligible employees, you should consider offering higher pay for certain holidays such as Independence Day, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve. Many companies offer unique benefits and incentives to employees on holiday pay such as bonus checks or paid time off. If your business has hourly employees, you can pay them the same as full-time employees, extending them the same benefits as salaried employees. The importance of holiday pay is that it’s a gesture of kindness towards employees. However, there can be exceptions. For example, the retail stores in India see a massive inflow of customers during special holidays such as Diwali, Holi, and Eid. These stores hire many hourly employees to meet the increased demand for service. It is not viable for them to offer additional compensation. In such a scenario, they can provide unique bonus gifts instead of worrying about calculating holiday pay for hourly employees. How do you calculate holiday pay for hourly employees? As mentioned above, the holiday pay is no different from employees’ regular pay, but there are exceptions depending on the company’s policies. 1. Overtime: If the employees work more than the regular hours during the holiday season, they are entitled to the same overtime pay as normal days. The overtime calculation is done as per the labor law. For instance, it is mandatory to pay employees double the average hourly pay rates for overtime hours in India. 2. 1.5 times pay: Though it is not a legal requirement, employees across the United States offer 1.5 times pay on certain holidays to reward employees for working on those days. Learn more about who qualified for time and a half and how it is calculated here . By incentivizing the holidays, the morale of the employees is boosted. 3. Double time pay: An employee is eligible for double time pay when the employee works over 40 hours in a work week. Under this, an employee is entitled to get paid twice the regular wage rate. Find more about how double time pay is calculated, when double-time pay rates are enforced here . 4. Bonuses: As an employer, you can choose to offer rewards during the holiday season to your employees. In India, offering paychecks and bonus gifts to employees during the Diwali holidays is a general practice. You can decide on bonuses based on years of service, base salary, or performance of the employees. The key takeaway here is that there are no special rules on laws that regulate holiday pay. The state and federal employment laws only decide the date that should be off. Calculating holiday pay for hourly or salaried employees is at the discretion of the employers. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account The calculation of holiday pay for hourly employees The calculation of the holiday pay is simple, depending on what things you offer to employees or casual workers to work on holidays.

Similarly, you can adjust bonuses or special incentives into the pay for regular and hourly employees to do the calculation.

As is the case for hourly employees, there is no specific law pertaining to holiday pay for salaried employees and is purely based on company policies. You should however make sure that employees aren’t working more than the total maximum hours mandated by your country/state. Employers can calculate the holiday pay of salaried employees as follows. Divide the yearly salary by 52. For example, if the yearly salary is 52,000, dividing it by 52 would give a weekly salary of $1000. If the employee is working for 8 hours a day for 5 days in a week, then that equates to 40 hours or $25 per hour. Discuss internally to determine a fair overtime hourly rate. In general, you can choose to pay 1.5 to 2 times the calculated hourly rate to incentivize employees working on holidays. Also it is a good practice to add this in the employment contract to avoid any potential complications. 4 Benefits of providing holiday pay to employees Holiday pay is an instrument of trust building and morale boosting between the employees and employers. It is a voluntary act of the organizations to show workers that they care about their comfort and happiness. Here are some of the most significant benefits of providing quality pay to workers. 1. Helps to increase productivity Compensating employees appropriately with the holiday pay can make them feel appreciated and valued. It effectively engages the workers and encourages them to work more, boosting the business’s productivity. Holiday pay offers one of the rare opportunities to incentivize employees to work more at the same time while building trust with them. It also benefits your employer’s brand and creates a good work environment. 2. Employees can work overtime It is not new that employees are not eager to work on holidays. Offering them holiday pay for additional incentives such as a 1.5 times rate is a great way to encourage them to work overtime as the payment is worth their time. It is more relevant for retail businesses that have to be open or do most of their business on holidays. The promise of extra pay is an excellent motivation for workers to work on holidays when most people choose not to work. Managers can fill in supervisors on calculating holiday pay for casual workers for the overtime on holidays. 3. Employees will get paid on a day off Paid holidays off constitute a significant morale boost for employees when they know they will be given days to rest without worrying about losing their wages. Holiday pay as paid time off has proven to lower stress levels, boost productivity, and improve workers’ mental health. It also benefits the business when workers are relaxed and happy about their employment. Paid time off during holidays shows goodwill and is a beneficial financial investment that employers can make to build the workers’ loyalty. 4. The reward for their work Gratitude is a character trait of great employers. By offering holiday pay, you reward the workers for their work on days when most people prefer not to work. It also makes parts of a company’s benefits to the workers to attract top talent. Often, employees look for the benefits offered before accepting an offer. Holiday pay is an additional motivator for employees to get your company’s job offerings. It shows that you care about your employees and their time, attracting strong job applicants. Conclusion When you create a policy on calculating holiday pay for hourly employees, you allow workers and managers to be clear about the company’s take on compensation for working on holidays. We hope this guide will help you avoid disgruntled employees or potential legal action and provide a reference for calculating holiday pay for salaried and hourly employees.

What Is Timesheet Fraud and How To Prevent It? July 23, 2024 As a company, if you are still relying on paper timesheets on spreadsheets to manage employees’ time and attendance , you are opening yourself to timesheet fraud. When a business manages employees’ time manually, it is prone to inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and non-compliance with working time provisions. It is not uncommon for such businesses to have timesheet fraud problems. Companies lose not only vast sums but also productivity due to such activities. An apt example of how severe timesheet fraud consequences can be is Saba software. The company was charged with timesheet fraud crimes, and SEC directed it to pay $1.7million in fines . In this article, we will detail everything about timesheet fraud that you must be aware of. We will discuss ways to increase management controls and how to eradicate deliberate forgery. Table of Contents What is timesheet fraud? Is falsifying a timesheet a crime? What is the most common type of timesheet fraud? 1. Exaggerating work hours 2. Human error causing inaccuracies 3. Buddy Punching 4. Long breaks 5. Favouritism How to prevent timesheet fraud? 1. Check and approve the timesheet regularly 2. Install CCTV cameras to monitor employee activity 3. Switch to automated attendance systems Conclusion What is timesheet fraud? Timesheet fraud is when employees at organizations that allow them to enter information regarding attendance into timesheets intentionally manipulate the data. Most of these businesses have a culture of employees recording the clock in and clock out time manually. The HR managers confirm these records for their validity later on. However, this opens an opportunity for some employees to manipulate the information in the timesheets by exaggerating the data. Merely rounding up the attendance time to the next hour is a case of fraud. Such timesheet fraud cases might not look too alarming, but when these extra minutes are compounded, they buildup into hours or even days. It is the responsibility of HR managers to ensure that all workers put in accurate attendance information in timesheets. Inaccuracies in attendance data can cost your business much money without you even realizing its impact. It will help if you familiarise yourself with what timesheet fraud is to ensure that no such activity occurs in your organization. Is falsifying a timesheet a crime? Yes, there are legal provisions against timesheet fraud, which can lead to job loss or legal proceedings against the offenders. Companies can terminate the employment contract or file civil liability and criminal charges against employee padding hours. Companies must communicate the timesheet fraud consequences to the employees and mention them in their employee contracts. In some cases, employees getting paid for the hours they have not worked can be trialled as guilty of theft. In some countries, time theft by the employees is taken as defrauding. Companies have the right to press charges against workers who commit timesheet fraud or indulge in time theft activities. However, this approach can be expensive. A much more suitable option is to terminate the employment contract. What is the most common type of timesheet fraud? For HR managers, it is crucial to understand what constitutes a timesheet fraud. Sometimes employees can commit such frauds out of carelessness accidentally. When you know the different types of timesheet frauds, you can take the appropriate action. Here are some most common types of time fraud: 1. Exaggerating work hours The most common type of time fraud in companies that use hard copy timesheets is inflation of work hours. Employees can intentionally record incorrect arrival and leaving times. 2. Human error causing inaccuracies HR managers can commit mistakes when the data from manual timesheets are migrated to the payroll software. Here the intention is not to save time theft, but due to inaccurate attendance records, problems arise. Such inaccuracies increase with the number of times the data has to be copied or added manually. An easy solution to get rid of it is to use an automatic attendance system like Truein that easily integrates with the payroll software. 3. Buddy Punching When companies rely on outdated card punching attendance systems , they are prone to the practice of buddy punching . Here an employee puts in false arrival and leaving time on behalf of a colleague. Buddy punching is one of the most common types of timesheet fraud. 4. Long breaks Some employees can exploit the lunch breaks by taking longer time breaks than the allotted one. This practice can significantly affect the productivity within a team and the work culture of other employees who might be affected by such behaviour. Even unauthorized breaks during work hours are time theft. Many employees are often seen doing their personal work and lengthening their lunch/tea breaks. To avoid long lunch break you should create a employee lunch break policy for your organization. 5. Favouritism Unlike other types of time fraud, this is committed by managers and supervisors who tend to favour an employee over others. Favouritism is when managers or supervisors overlook absenteeism , lateness, or long breaks off an employee they like or share personal interests with. How to prevent timesheet fraud? There are several ways to curb the menace of timesheet fraud. The right solution depends on what type of fraud the organization faces. 1. Check and approve the timesheet regularly If your company cannot get rid of manual submission of timesheets, you can instil strict policies around timesheet management. Ask managers and supervisors to check and approve the timesheet regularly. Clearly define strict actions against the employees who will indulge in time theft activities. Such steps will encourage workers to record the accurate time promptly. Also, ensure that workers submit their timesheets without delay because the more time they take, the more prone they will be to commit mistakes. You are responsible for ensuring that shift schedules and workloads are optimized, so workers do not feel unnecessary pressure. If the timelines are unrealistic and shift schedules are too overbearing, workers might be forced to commit buddy punching. Review the shift schedule with employees to make it easy for them. 2. Install CCTV cameras to monitor employee activity It is advisable to install CCTV cameras to monitor employee activity on the floor. This will help in managing problems like long breaks and buddy punching. 3. Switch to automated attendance systems Adopting automated attendance systems can eliminate inaccuracies in attendance recording and curb activities such as buddy punching. While biometric attendance systems are standard, their performance and accuracy are not as efficient as modern AI-powered facial recognition attendance systems like Truein. Truein is a highly effective solution to prevent timesheet fraud as it uses facial recognition technology to mark attendance. There is no scope for exploiting the attendance system by clocking in inappropriately. Moreover, it eliminates the need to manually manage timesheets as it integrates with some of the most popular payroll systems. The employee attendance data is directly imported into the payroll software. It saves a lot of time for HR managers and reduces overhead expenses by promptly providing accurate labour data for the payroll calculation. It has robust scheduling, reporting, and leave management features that help companies manage business operations effectively, thus increasing their productivity. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion Timesheet fraud can be a significant productivity issue and affect revenue if left unchecked. It is the responsibility of HR managers to prevent time fraud cases. If your company doesn’t have strict attendance policies or if there is a communication gap between managers and workers, it is essential to bridge the gap and clearly state the consequences of indulging in timesheet fraud activities. Thus, companies must take all the precautions necessary to prevent timesheet fraud before taking legal action against employees. We hope this guide will help.

Ghost Employees: How To Prevent and Detect It? July 23, 2024 It might be hard to imagine, but there are instances when companies pay for employees who do not exist in reality. It is like paying someone who doesn’t show up for work. That’s what happens with ghost employees. Ghost employee fraud usually happens at global companies with decentralized payroll processes. As these companies have to maintain payroll across countries that involve different currencies and tax implications, it is easier for them to fall victim to this type of payroll fraud . According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners , as many as 29% of large and small businesses globally are affected by ghost employee fraud. Ghost employees are the most difficult to detect of all the payroll frauds. The financial implication of ghost employees on payroll can be huge. For instance, the Indian Railways Department has to suffer a loss of USD 187,600 due to ghost employees. For HR managers, it is essential to know how to prevent ghosting employees. This article is all about dealing with ghost employee fraud. Table of Contents Ghost employee meaning How to detect and prevent ghost employees 1. Background checks for accounting employees 2. Maintain the records of employees accurately 3. Conduct routine audit to detect ghost employees 4. Clearly define procedures for payroll 5. Eliminate ghost workers menace using facial recognition 6. Incentivize existing employees to report ghost employment Conclusion Ghost employee meaning Ghost employee or ghost payroll is an essential concept for HR professionals. A ghost employee is a worker who exists on paper and is added to the company’s payroll to take a wage, even though the company does not employ them. Sometimes, it could be a deceased person who is not taken out from the payroll due to unawareness or accidentally. But in most scenarios, fictitious employees are added to the payroll to commit financial fraud. Whatever the reason, HR managers must ensure that their organization is not paying for the workers who do not exist. Now that you understand what ghost employees are, let’s look at common ways these employees exist within a company. The most common reason why ghost employees exist is that someone within the company adds them intending to commit fraud. Some employees can indulge in buddy punching marking attendance for workers on leave. Deceased employees or employees who left the job but still exist on the payroll. How to detect and prevent ghost employees For businesses suffering from ghost employee menace, there are specific ways to deal with the issue. HR managers must ensure that the employee management is not chaotic. Usually, unclear processes leave the scope for such frauds to occur. Given that for a large workforce, it is not easy to find ghost employees, this is why some essential steps are needed to prevent ghost employees. Large companies with hundreds of workers can track payroll budgets and investigate spikes in the report that does not match the labour projection. Smaller businesses can take a much simpler approach like hand-delivering paychecks to ensure only employees working get the pay. Any leftovers indicate ghost employee fraud. HR managers can bring in some provisions to prevent payroll fraud. Here are some steps to get started: Check on all workers before hiring with background checks Ensure that employee data in the payroll system is accurate and updated Avoid single-point-of-contact systems Use financial checks and balances audits 1. Background checks for accounting employees Companies should take extra measures to thoroughly evaluate employees with access to the payroll and accounting systems. Whether an entry-level accounts clerk or a CFO, background checks for these professionals are necessary. There are several ways to identify ghost employees. You can hire agencies for the job to audit the background of prospective employees before hiring them. 2. Maintain the records of employees accurately Whether new hires or existing employees, HR managers must ensure that their accurate and current data is in the payroll system. No new hires must be allowed to work until their information is collected, verified, and entered into the system. There must be strict policies to deal with employees who provide incorrect information or try to defraud the payroll system. 3. Conduct routine audit to detect ghost employees Hiring honest employees and ensuring accurate employee data will not be enough. To ensure that there are no ghost employees on the payroll, you must conduct routine financial audits. With audits, you can immediately find any mismatches or fraudulent activities. Not only fictitious employees, but regular audits can also help find duplicate entries, clerical errors, unverified government identification numbers, attendance recording inconsistencies, and more. While not all clerical mistakes are fraud, repeated mistakes can help you identify patterns, such as repetitive manual timekeeping adjustments. Or terminated employees are still kept as active in the payroll system. Smaller companies without well-defined human resource management systems can rely on self-audits; for a more complex organizational audit, you can hire consultants or third-party services. 4. Clearly define procedures for payroll If the company has clearly defined processes for payroll and accounting activities, there will be no opportunity for fraud. All employees must be trained to adhere to the methods and workflows decided. For instance, the HR department should maintain a checklist of worker information that must be entered into the system before their first work day. A similar list must be there for terminating an employee. Both processes ensure that all the employee data within the payroll system is accurate and updated. Usually, when employees are terminated or when they leave, if the information is not updated soon, it creates an opportunity for ghost employee fraud. 5. Eliminate ghost workers menace using facial recognition Human interference with attendance recording can be a hotspot for ghost employee fraud. To eliminate ghost workers you can use a facial recognition based automated attendance systems like Truein that eliminate manual attendance timesheets. Truein is a new-age face recognition attendance system that can integrate with most payroll software. It is designed to automate attendance and leave management .

Incentivize existing employees to report ghost employment Offer a reward for any accurate and verifiable reports. This could be a cash prize or other incentives, such as additional time off or recognition at company-wide meetings. Another option is to establish a confidential reporting system, such as a hotline or anonymous online form, that allows employees to report any suspected ghost employment without fear of retribution. This can create a culture of transparency and integrity within the organization and encourage employees to speak up if they see any suspicious activity. Additionally, it may be helpful to provide employees with training and education on the importance of reporting ghost employment and the potential consequences of failing to do so. This can help employees understand the gravity of the issue and feel more inclined to speak up if they suspect any wrongdoing. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion Ghost employees can haunt your profit margins for months and years without being detected.
