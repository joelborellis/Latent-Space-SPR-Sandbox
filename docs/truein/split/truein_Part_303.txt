Employers must be aware of these laws for legal compliance, managing labor costs, and maintaining employee relations. The Alabama overtime laws and regulations are set within state and federal guidelines. As an employer, you must be aware of these laws and implement them within your H.R. policies. To help employers comply, we created this comprehensive guide overviewing Alabama overtime laws.

Conclusion Understanding Alabama Overtime Laws Definition of overtime according to Alabama law In Alabama, as of 2024, any hours worked over 40 in a single workweek are considered overtime as per law. It is in tandem with federal law and consistently implements the Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA) definition. Alabama has no state law definition for overtime; however, unlike most states, Alabama doesn’t require daily overtime pay for hours worked over a standard eight-hour workday. This means that if the total work hours do not exceed the 40-hour weekly threshold, even if workers work over 8 hours a day, they do not need to be paid overtime. Which employees are entitled to overtime pay? The majority of hourly employees in Alabama are entitled to overtime pay. It includes all hourly, tipped, and certain salaried employees. The state follows the FSLA laws on the overtime eligibility criteria, ensuring that full-time and part-time workers receive compensation for overtime hours irrespective of industry type. However, under Alabama law, certain employees, such as independent contractors and volunteers, are generally not eligible for overtime pay. Exemptions: Categories of employees exempt from overtime As of 2024, Alabama overtime laws recognize all exemptions described within the FSLA framework. Under these regulations, specific categories of employees are exempted from overtime pay requirements. It typically applies to salaried employees who meet specific criteria related to their job duties, responsibilities, and salary levels. Here are the employees commonly exempted from overtime in Alabama, including executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and certain computer-related occupations. Any employee who is highly compensated, earning over $107,432 per year Employees responsible for managing at least one other employee, such as administrators and executives Employees working in creative professions and sales Salaried computer employees earning at least $684 per week Outside sales employees All other salaried employees working in positions requiring specialized skills and knowledge For employers, it is essential to be aware of these exemptions and accurately categorize employees to avoid potential legal issues. Calculation of overtime pay rates The overtime pay rates in Alabama are the same as the federal rates, which are 1.5 times the regular wage rate. For every hour worked over 40 per week, employees should be paid one and a half times the regular pay rate. For instance, if an employee’s regular hourly rate is $15, their overtime rate would be $22.50 (1.5 x $15) per hour. This is a simple calculation for salaried employees. However, overtime calculation for commission employees in Alabama is different. The overtime rate for commission-receiving employees is calculated as follows: (Total hours x hourly rate + commission) / total hours worked in the workweek Then, they are paid half of this regular rate for each overtime hour. Let’s understand this with an example. An employee works for 50 hours a week at minimum wage, that’s $7.25 per hour and receives $50 as commission for the week. Their overtime rate will be calculated as follows: 50 x 7.25 + 50 / 50 = 8.25 But they will be paid half of this rate for overtime, which is 8.25/2 = $4.12 per hour. So their total pay will be : 40 x $7.25 + 10 x $4.12 = $ 331.30 Employers must ensure that overtime calculations are based on the actual hours worked and that the pay rate accurately reflects the employee’s regular earnings. Key Provisions of Alabama Overtime Laws Overtime pay rate: Calculation and requirements Overtime pay rates in Alabama are, by federal law, one and a half times the regular pay rate with exemptions. Salaried and tipped employees receive overtime at this rate; however, employers can use the “tip credit” system for tipped employees. It allows employers to pay tipped employees lower than the minimum wage rate. However, employers cannot include the tipped credit in the overtime pay calculation, and the final compensation should not be lower than the minimum wage rate, including tips. For commission-based employees, the overtime rate is as mentioned above, which considers their commission earnings, too. All eligible employees are entitled to receive one and a half times their regular hourly rate for overtime hours, whether full-time or part-time. Hours worked: What constitutes “work” for overtime purposes? As per the FLSA section 29 C.F.R. Part 785 , all time an employee is required to be on the employer’s premises, on duty, or at a prescribed workplace is counted as working time. However, additional conditions such as travel time, on-call time, and training time can also be included in the overtime depending on the scenario and need to be discussed with the legal team. However, employers should include break periods of less than 30 minutes at work. Additionally, any time spent in preparation before the actual start of the main work activity is also considered work. Record-keeping requirements for employers As per the Alabama overtime laws in 2024, all employers in the state must keep accurate records of their employees. This includes their total hours worked each day and workweek, the regular hourly pay rate, total daily or weekly straight-time earnings, total overtime earnings for the workweek, deductions from or additions to wages, and total wages paid each pay period. As per the law, it is essential to maintain accurate records for employees for three years to comply with legal standards. It also serves employers as crucial documentation for disputes or inspections. Enforcement and penalties for violations Per the 2022 Code of Alabama Title 25 – Industrial Relations and Labor Chapter 8 , violating labor laws can lead to significant penalties. These penalties include back payment of wages owed, liquidated damages, fines, and, in severe cases, legal sanctions. The penalty can include a fine of $300, which can go up to a civil penalty of $5000 for certain violations. An employer who violates Act 2009-565 may be deemed guilty of a Class B or Class C misdemeanor. All employers must adhere to the Alabama overtime laws to avoid costly legal repercussions and to maintain a fair and compliant workplace environment. Common Misconceptions about Alabama Overtime Laws It is common for employers to be confused about various aspects of Alabama overtime laws. Let’s look at some of the common myths regarding these laws. Myth: All salaried employees are exempt from overtime pay Being paid a salary does not automatically exempt an employee from overtime. It entirely depends on an employee’s job duties and salary level and strictly follows the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines. Myth: If an employee agrees to it, you don’t have to pay overtime All eligible employees must be paid overtime, regardless of any agreement. Employers must comply with the overtime regulations irrespective of any informal or formal agreements with employees to waive overtime pay. Myth: Employees working overtime without permission qualify for overtime pay In Alabama, employees must have permission from their employers to work overtime shifts. Employees in all roles should have permission to be eligible to receive pay for overtime hours. Frequently Asked Questions Can I offer comp time instead of overtime pay? All private sector employers in Alabama must pay overtime rather than offer compensatory time off. The payment must be made in the next regular payroll period following the period in which the overtime was earned. Do meal and break periods count as work time for overtime calculations? It depends on the duration of the break. Short breaks, usually lasting about 5 to 20 minutes, are generally considered compensable work hours. Any break of 30 minutes or longer is not considered work time. How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Truein can be a significant aid in managing overtime pay in several ways.

Among essential compliance requirements is the New Hampshire overtime law, which mandates that all employees receive fair compensation for overtime. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the various laws and regulations regarding overtime in New Hampshire. The aim is to help employers ensure legal compliance and foster fair work practices that align with state and federal laws. Here, we are about to discuss the basics of overtime laws, minimum wage requirements, calculation for payment of wages, and and exemptions.

Conclusion New Hampshire Overtime Laws: Basics for Employers There is no particular New Hampshire overtime law, and the state follows the federal guidelines in deciding the regulations for overtime work. Following the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the state mandates that all employees receive overtime pay for hours over 40 in a workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times their regular pay rate. Employers in New Hampshire must review the FLSA guidelines on overtime pay and frame their policies to comply with the requirements. While employees must be paid for overtime hours, who is eligible for overtime and how it is calculated depends on different factors. Next, we will look at these requirements. Who is Entitled to Receive Overtime Pay as per New Hampshire Overtime Law Most hourly employees in New Hampshire are entitled to overtime pay. However, there are exemptions, such as certain administrative, executive, and professional employees, who may be exempt under specific criteria set by the FLSA. These employees are exempted based on their job description or earnings, which is predominantly according to the guidelines set by the FLSA . Generally, most hourly workers are non-exempt and entitled to overtime pay. That’s why employers need to classify employees to avoid legal issues correctly. Misclassification can lead to costly lawsuits and penalties. Salaried Employees May Be Eligible for Overtime Given the definitions of the overtime regulations as per FLSA, it is common for employers to classify all salaried employees as exempt from overtime. However, certain salaried employees are eligible for overtime. Employers must be aware that overtime eligibility is not solely determined by whether an employee is salaried or hourly but by the nature of their job responsibilities and salary level. For instance, a salaried employee earning less than a specified threshold (minimum $7.25 per hour) may still be eligible for overtime under the New Hampshire overtime law. This threshold is subject to periodic updates, so employers should monitor any changes in the law. Therefore, employers in the state must carefully assess the duties and compensation levels of their salaried employees to determine their overtime eligibility. Minimum Wage and Regular Payment of Wages In New Hampshire, as of 2024, employers must pay the minimum wage as determined by the federal standard, set at $7.25 per hour. This wage rate applies to most employees, with specific rules for tipped employees, who must receive a base wage of at least 45% of the standard minimum wage. Employers hiring tipped workers can pay a minimum wage of $3.27 per hour, provided their tipped employees regularly receive over $30 monthly in customer tips. The tips and the base wage must meet or exceed the standard minimum wage. You can refer to the New Hampshire Department of Labor site for complete details. Importance of Timely and Regular Payment of Wages to Employees New Hampshire law emphasizes the timely and regular payment of wages. Employers must ensure employees are paid within eight days of the week they perform the work. Additionally, in case of employment termination, compensation should be made within 72 hours if an employee is fired or quits with adequate notice or by the next regular payday if the employee quits without sufficient notice or is laid off. New Hampshire Department of Labor (NHDOL) mandates that employees are paid weekly and not less frequently than monthly under any condition. In case of a dispute over the amount of wages, employers are required to pay the undisputed part while leaving the employee free to pursue claims for the balance New Hampshire Overtime Law Summary Overview of relevant state and federal statutes New Hampshire’s overtime law is entirely based on the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) statutes, with only one exception. According to the FLSA, employees younger than 20 can be paid below the set minimum of $7.25 per hour. However, under the New Hampshire overtime law regulations, employees younger than 16. New Hampshire overtime rules The FLSA mandates that employees must be paid overtime at a rate of at least one and one-half times their regular rate for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. New Hampshire overtime law aligns with this federal mandate. Employers must ensure that their overtime policies align with the federal and local overtime laws. It’s also crucial to be aware that any updates in federal laws might necessitate changes in their payroll practices. When federal overtime rules apply Overtime eligibility in New Hampshire predominantly follows the guidelines set by the FLSA. As per federal law, non-exempt employees generally include hourly workers, both full-time and part-time employees. If you are not employing white-collar workers such as executive, administrative, or professional roles, you probably hire employees entitled to overtime pay. Ensure to refer to the FLSA guidelines to decide if an employee meets specific criteria related to their job duties and compensation to be exempted. Employers need to classify employees to avoid legal issues correctly. Misclassification can lead to costly lawsuits and penalties. Do not take the exemption of statutes as an indication that all salaried employees under the New Hampshire overtime law are exempted. The nature of the job and salary determines if a salaried employee is eligible for overtime. If the employee’s responsibility does not involve overlooking at least one employee, making management or administrative decisions, or specialized skills, then such an employee may be eligible for overtime. Additionally, any salaried employee earning less than that minimum wage, irrespective of their job description, will be eligible for overtime. Therefore, employers must carefully assess their salaried employees’ duties and compensation levels to determine their overtime eligibility. Exemptions from federal overtime laws While New Hampshire’s overtime laws largely mirror the FLSA, it is essential to recognize all state regulations, such as the age limit for minimum wage in New Hampshire being 16 and not 20, as set by the FLSA. Employers are responsible for understanding and implementing overtime laws for fair compensation. This requirement involves maintaining accurate records of hours worked and wages paid, correctly classifying employees, and ensuring that eligible employees receive the appropriate overtime compensation. Overtime Entitlement and Calculation Methods According to New Hampshire overtime laws, all non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay. It requires that employers should correctly classify employees for overtime calculation. The exempted employees include: Seasonal employees working for amusement or recreational establishments Administrative Staff Executives Outside sales workers Computer-related fields Jobs require specialized skills The overtime rates in New Hampshire are as per the FLSA, which is $7.25 per hour. However, employees can pay lower than minimum wage to tipped employees, provided they earn different monthly tips. Let’s take a look at overtime calculations for different employees. Overtime calculation for tipped employees in New Hampshire Tipped employees in New Hampshire customarily and regularly receive more than $30 per month in tips. As per the state law, such employees can be paid a base wage of 45% of the regular minimum wage, around $3.27 per hour. However, employers must ensure that while calculating overtime, the regular hourly rate for a tipped employee should be considered the standard minimum wage, not the reduced base wage. Employers can use the tip credit system to calculate overtime hours for tipped employees. Overtime calculation for salaried employees in New Hampshire If salaried employees are not exempt, overtime pay calculation is straightforward. Such employees are paid 1.5 times their regular wage rate for hours more than 40 over a work week. In simple terms, their overtime payment will be: 40 hours x regular wage rate + Hours over 40 x (1.5 x regular wage rate) Overtime calculation with commission in New Hampshire For calculating overtime for employees who receive an hourly wage plus commission in New Hampshire, here’s the formula: {((Total hours x Hourly Rate) + Commission) / Total hours} / 2 Suppose an employee earns $15 per hour, works 45 hours a week, and earns a commission of $200. Their new regular pay will be: ($15/hour x 45 hours) + $200 commission = $875 To determine the regular pay rate: $875 / 45 hours = $19.44 per hour. But they will be paid at half this rate, so $19.44 per hour / = $9.72 per hour. Hence, for their extra 5 hours, they will earn $9.72 x 5 = $48.6. Specific considerations for overtime in the Healthcare industry Employers in the healthcare sector can use the “8 and 80” rule for overtime calculations. As per this rule, employees are entitled to overtime pay for hours worked over 8 in a single day or 80 in a 14-day work period, whichever is greater. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) approves this method for hospitals and residential care establishments that may adopt a 14-day work period instead of the typical 7-day workweek. Use of compensatory time as an alternative to overtime pay In New Hampshire, public sector employers can offer employees compensatory time, also known as “comp,” instead of overtime pay. The comp time is offered as additional time off instead of overtime pay for working extra hours. However, private-sector employers cannot use compensatory time as an alternative to overtime pay. In the case of public sector employers, too, employees should be in a collective bargaining agreement with the employer to receive compensatory time. Exceptions and Exemptions in New Hampshire Overtime Laws New Hampshire’s overtime laws generally follow the FLSA exceptions and exemptions. These exceptions often apply to specific job categories or industries: Agricultural workers Seasonal employees Executives Administrative Professional employees making at least $684 per week Misclassification of Independent Contractors A prevalent issue in overtime law compliance is misclassifying employees as independent contractors. However, some employers do it to avoid paying social security taxes, workers’ compensation, and overtime pay. Employers need more than just simply labeling an employee as an independent contractor or even entering into a written agreement to avoid significant legal repercussions for employers. Proper classification requires satisfying all the requirements of a 1099 employee . Impact of Payroll Deductions on Overtime Calculations Payroll deductions can only be implemented if determined by the New Hampshire overtime law or written agreement. During overtime pay calculation, employers must provide a written statement of all deductions made, such as insurance premiums, donations, unemployment taxes, etc. Legal Compliance and Enforcement Requirements for Wage Payments New Hampshire labor law mandates employers to adhere to wage payment regulations, which include providing detailed pay statements and pay stubs. These instruments must clearly outline the hours worked, wages earned, and any deductions made. Regulations Concerning Meal and Rest Breaks for Employees New Hampshire law requires employers to provide 30-minute meals and rest breaks for employees if they are working for more than five consecutive hours. If employers cannot allow time off because of the nature of the work, employees should be paid as they are working and eating simultaneously. Understanding the Statute of Limitations for Unpaid Overtime Claims Employees can take legal action against an employer by filing claims for unpaid overtime in non-compliance. New Hampshire agrees with the FLSA guideline that mandates that an employee can file a claim within 2- 2 years from the date of overtime law violation by the employer. However, this statute can be extended to 3 years if the violation by the employer is wilful. Penalties for Violations of New Hampshire Wage and Overtime Laws Violations of wage and overtime laws in New Hampshire can result in significant penalties, including double the amount of unpaid back wages plus attorneys’ fees incurred by employees. Responsibilities of Employers Regarding Layoffs, Plant Closings, and WARN Notice In layoffs or plant closings, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) is applied to New Hampshire employers, requiring them to inform their employees 60 days in advance about plant closing or mass layoffs. Case Studies and Examples We can look at the McCarthy v. Medicus Healthcare Solutions, LLC case to better understand the implications of violating New Hampshire overtime law. The employee, James McCarthy, sued his employer, Medicus Healthcare Solutions (Medicus), for not paying him overtime wages. He claimed his employer made him work 40 hours a week without proper overtime wages. Furthermore, Medicus maintained records of approved overtime work and pay but not of “off-the-clock” hours. The court ruled that the employer was in wilful violation of the overtime law. Lessons learned here are: Employers refusing overtime compensation knowingly can be tried as wilful violators of the FLSA. Such offense can result in up to 3 years of overtime back wages.
