How does Face Recognition Technology work? June 21, 2024 How easy is it to identify a person you have met before? Usually, very easy! You may say it is because you remember him. Technically, your brain is matching it against a memory it has. Face recognition by machines work in a similar fascinating way. Table of Contents What is Face Recognition? Steps for Face Recognition Not all face recognition technology is created equal How Easy Is It To Beat Facial Recognition What makes Truein’s face recognition technology unique? Why face recognition is the most futuristic ID system? Read more: What is Face Recognition? The Dictionary definition of face recognition is the ability of a computer to scan, store, and recognize human faces for use in identifying people. Today this term is not very alien. Apple users use Face ID to unlock their phones. Airport security uses it to identify convicts. Workplace safety apps like Truein use it to mark attendance or authorize visitors. Steps for Face Recognition There are many variations of this technology. We will look at the most common approach. Let’s break down the definition. 1. Scan: A person walks by a machine that takes its picture and identifies its geometry. By geometry we mean distance of the nose from chin or location of eyes. There can be 60 to 80 such data points that make the complete face ID. 2. Store: The face ID, a mathematical formula consisting of data points is stored in the database. The computer understands this as your signature – unique to you. 3. Recognize: Next time you walk past the same machine, it can create a similar map and trace it against the database it has. Result? You are identified. Not all face recognition technology is created equal Face recognition was first invented by Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe in 1960s. Back then the degree of errors was vast and the amount of time it took to return a result was huge. Part of it was due to computing power of machines back then. Besides, the number of facial markers used to create a Face ID were low. In 1970s there were 21 facial markers. Today, the sophisticated machines use as many as 80, increasing accuracy. How Easy Is It To Beat Facial Recognition Facial recognition gets seriously compromised if the machine is not geared to identify in low-light or with changing facial features. It will result in two things: False negative: It won’t identify a person despite his ID being present in the database. It can be frustrating, but it is not dangerous. False positive: It will identify a person wrongly as another person. A false match is a bad sign, especially when law-enforcing agencies use it. It is therefore critical that you pick a face recognition technology that stands the test of time. A time-tested and proven technology by a trusted provider is the key to adopting this futuristic technology. What makes Truein’s face recognition technology unique? We believe that accuracy has to be practically hundred percent. Any small error leads to manual work, beating the purpose of our technology. This hundred percent perfection has happened over many years through many iterations. Today, we are proud to meet those benchmarks. Truein face recognition attendance is benchmarked with eyes. Result? No amount of facial changes can affect our performance. Ageing, hats, face masks – doesn’t matter. It works. We beat the odds. Our face recognition technology has proved to work in low-light conditions as well. So common work conditions like night shift workers or outdoor construction sites don’t pose a challenge to our system. It works offline too. So, there are practically no barriers to primary enterprise activities – face attendance and visitor management. Distant sites or stores too can use it seamlessly. We have invested in the necessary infrastructure to make it super-fast. We surely don’t want people to wait in queues while the device scans and marks face attendance for each employee. It takes just three seconds, including changeover time. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Why face recognition is the most futuristic ID system? Biometric IDs are unique and beat the traditional paper-pen or card systems hands down. Cards can be swiped by proxies and attendance can be fudged. It is a common malpractice, often seen at plants within contract workers. The thumb IDs are biometric too, but they have failed to meet the hundred percent benchmark. Women using Indian Mehndi on hands feel frustrated when their thumbs don’t get identified at office machines. Similarly, plant workers who work on oily machines cannot walk past a thumb-based system easily. Besides, it is not touchless, and it takes multiple attempts for one correct match. Face recognition is truly the only unique identifier, doing its job in few seconds. It cannot be proxies or scope for manual overrides.

How geo-fencing takes touchless attendance to the next level? June 21, 2024 Face recognition based attendance is the straight off answer to the touchless solution the world is seeking today. Or may it is not as straight. Not all face recognition attendance is made equal. It is important to consider specific use-cases before picking the one that works for you. Today, we will focus on use-cases for geo-fencing – a powerful feature on Truein’s contactless attendance system . Table of Contents What is geo-fencing? Who is it most relevant for? 1. Retail chains 2. Construction sites 3. Marketing and event agencies 4. Any other large organization What are the key advantages? 1. Being compliant: 2. Being progressive: 3. Being safe What should you know about geo-fencing on Truein? The bottom line What is geo-fencing? With Truein, organizations can allow users to mark attendance from their very own phone . Organization’s ability to limit such attendance to only a specific geography (usually a radius around the office) is called geo-fencing. Geo-fencing can be activated to ensure that employees don’t queue up in front of the kiosk at the main gates, conveniently use their own phone but do not misuse it while vacationing. Who is it most relevant for? 1. Retail chains Large retail chains can avoid putting a kiosk at every store. Each individual store can geo-fence attendance for their site and employees can mark attendance from their devices . It can result in huge savings while ensuring automation that syncs data back to the head-office in real-time. 2. Construction sites In case of outdoor locations, the supervisors need not report to office before going to the site. They can go to their work site directly and mark attendance after reaching that geo-fenced boundary. It makes sense for even contract workers who keep changing and report to site directly. 3. Marketing and event agencies Any organization that employs a large workforce that is on their feet and always on field, would find geo-fencing very useful. The geo-fencing feature can be used to mark radius around the distributor’s office where sales team reports. It can also be used to mark an event location where the marketing team is working. 4. Any other large organization In case you have a large employee strength, you can shorten the queue at the main gate by activating user-device based geo-fenced attendance. What are the key advantages? 1. Being compliant: We believe that automation of attendance should always be 100%. If you leave scope for manual entries in case of remote sites, on-field force etc., you are increasing chances of proxy and plenty of paperwork. When data for the entire workforce gets automated – no matter where they are, all of it can feed back into compliance and salary calculations. 2. Being progressive: The hard part about allowing employees to report directly to remote sites is the ability to track and trust. You can leave all of it behind and embrace progressive HR policies. Geo-fencing is your safety net – an assurance that all will be well even when you adopt laissez-faire policies. It sure leaves a good impact on employee satisfaction score as well. 3. Being safe When social-distancing is active and you have a large workforce queuing up at the kiosk, you could consider moving to geo-fenced user-device attendance. People can space out and mark attendance from their desks if they please. What should you know about geo-fencing on Truein? Truein has evolved over the last 4 years to include more than hundred features. Geo-fencing is only one of them. Like always we have focused on keeping it simple. It can be activated or deactivated by the user at a click of a button There is no limit to how many locations can be activated It is possible to geo-fence attendance by adding Google location address or latitude/longitude co-ordinates It is also possible to define the radius around the marked address. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account The bottom line Face recognition is the buzzword in touchless attendance . However, that is just the beginning. Making it more widespread and employee-friendly is what true evolution would be.

How retail chains are solving the age-old attendance & compliance problem? June 21, 2024 It is (relatively) easy to track attendance in a corporate park or branch. How do you handle attendance tracking and compliance when you have dispersed outlets with varying staff strength of ten to fifty employees? Even large brands have not found the perfect answer. They end up using a mix of methodologies like thumb-based/card-swipe systems in larger stores and some manual registers in smaller ones. Neither are fool-proof and the age-old problem persists even today. Table of Contents What are the top retail attendance challenges and their solution? Retailers can heave a sigh of relief What are the top retail attendance challenges and their solution? 1. Hardware Installation: Installing a hardware for attendance at every single shop is not practical, especially when the staff strength is not large. Besides, retail chains are always in an expansion mode and installing hardware in all new stores is not a scalable idea. Solution: Opt for a biometric attendance system that will benefit your retail store , and a solution like Truein face attendance does not require any hardware installation. How face recognition attendance system works ? It works on any Android or iOS device. It can also be configured to work from an employee’s own phone. It is scalable to as many stores as one may need, without any added upfront hardware cost. 2. Remote locations: A lot of retail stores are located in far-off locations, with limited internet access. Most attendance systems require the internet to function and may be redundant in smaller towns. Solution: Always check if the system you shortlisted works in offline mode. Truein face attendance can work offline and sync data online when the internet comes available. That way, all stores can have a single attendance system. No exceptions! 3. Parallel systems: When attendance systems like the thumb or card don’t work at all times due to non-detection or errors, people start using parallel systems like manual registers. Smaller stores don’t have the infrastructure for maintenance and resort to alternatives. That makes the organization prone to proxies and leakages in the system which add hidden costs. Solution: Try to use a system that does not allow people to slip through. A face attendance software like Truein works practically hundred percent of all times. Thumb not being recognised or the card getting damaged are not the kind of excuses you hear with face recognition. It simply works, no matter what! 4. Store wise reconciliation: With retail chains using multiple systems across multiple stores, it is often a task to bring it all together at the end of the month and calculate salaries. Not to forget, there are sick leaves , casual leaves, public holidays and other such complexities too. It takes many man hours to sync this data across stores and of course, it can never be foolproof. Solution: An attendance system backed by solid software can link everything from holidays and leaves to shifts and compliances. Everything flows through just one comprehensive system so you can simply export the reports and disburse remunerations. No manual syncs! Truein makes it possible. 5. No visibility: It is not possible for HR or leadership teams to see what is happening at different outlets on a day-to-day basis. Attendance, compliances and all are left to local teams. Head office comes to know about the attendance percentages only at the end of the month when there is a manual sync. The system is not agile. It is difficult to ensure that rules are complied with. Solution: It is important to choose a system that syncs data in real-time back to the head office or HR admins. Anybody can see analytics through the web dashboard or on their mobile. Truein brings this power and transparency. 5. Shift management : Retail stores often operate for twelve hours. They have staff working in rotation shifts. Often, separate morning, afternoon and general shift registers are maintained to manually track the shift allocation and attendance . Again, another manual entry which has to be synced and is prone to human error. Solution: Have it all as part of the attendance system! Shift allocation is technically an extension of attendance and systems like Truein make it possible to link the two. One can allocate shifts in bulk to the entire staff via a simple spreadsheet upload or can do it individually for every staff member. Retailers can heave a sigh of relief Finally, there is an attendance system that works in every situation – offline, with shifts, with compliance rules and more. One click enables complete sync and export for next steps like salary disbursement. Large retailers like PC Jewellers have trusted Truein and have rolled it out to their entire chain in no time – no hardware installation required, after all! When the pandemic posed more challenges to the already existing retail attendance woes, there was only one solution they could reliably depend on – face attendance with no hardware and a solid software.

Why you don’t need to install attendance machines? June 21, 2024 When companies evolved from paper-based attendance to one that was technology enabled, they were asked to install machines for card swiping or thumb imprints. Once upon a time that felt like an obvious choice. Not anymore! If you are still installing bulky attendance systems, you are probably living in a cave. There are choices. Go hardware-less! Table of Contents Introducing hardware-less face recognition attendance Why does hardware-based attendance increase liability? 1. Initial investment 2. Recurring maintenance 3. Lack of portability 4. Parallel systems 5. Limited use case 6. Onboarding pain Step into the future Read More: Introducing hardware-less face recognition attendance The charm of technology is not in its complexity, but in its practicality. Consider Truein’s face attendance app – it can be installed on any tablet or mobile to get started in no time. A common tablet (any Android or iOS device) at the gate is all the infrastructure you need. Or better still – install nothing! Ask your employees to do a selfie-attendance from their very own phone. How do you ensure they are not marking attendance from home or a beach holiday? With Truein geo-fencing, of course. Our geofencing attendance feature lets employees mark selfie attendance only from geographical boundaries set by you. Define the radius from your office and you are set. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Why does hardware-based attendance increase liability? 1. Initial investment If you have hundred construction sites or two hundred retail stores, would you invest a machine everywhere? The cost would multiply manifold. Besides, nothing lives forever. You are looking at a similar investment every few years. 2. Recurring maintenance Hardware that you or your IT does not understand will always have an external dependency. It will have its maintenance requirements. It means calling the technicians every time you hit a snag. It can also mean annual maintenance contracts and more cost. In comparison an Android or iOS based simple tablet or mobile needs little to no troubleshooting. And anyone can do it! 3. Lack of portability Typical hardware-based systems have heavy installations which act as permanent fixtures. They are immovable. They sit with your furniture. When you move somewhere, you need a technician again. Contrast that with a simple iOS or Android-based mobile attendance system with a temporary stand. Move it around as you please. Rainy days? Move it inside. No problem! 4. Parallel systems Whether it is card-based system or thumb-based system, you always hear complains about card not getting recognized or thumb not being accepted. An oily hand or scratches on card are common reasons for the system to not work. Result? The admin pulls out a manual entry register which is reconciled end of the month. We take attendance seriously. With Truein face attendance , you get practically hundred percent accuracy and reliability. No parallel systems, please! 5. Limited use case When you install a hardware, you are only thinking about your desk employees. What about your field workers or mobile workforce? Can a marketing manager mark attendance from agency’s office? Can a salesperson report from distributor’s office? Not if they need a large machine to mark attendance. Consider the Truein mobile-based selfie attendance. It works for very many use cases: On field staff doesn’t have to come to office only to mark attendance In construction industry or similar industry where sites keep changing, there is no unnecessary infrastructure created. The security guard can take attendance of all contract workers from his device. Retail outlets which run in hundreds and thousands can just geo-fence their stores and let employees mark attendance from their phones. 6. Onboarding pain Every time a new employee joins in, there is a long process of thumb registration or card activation. How would you like to replace it with a face recognition system that lets new employees click a selfie and onboard themselves in no time? You will like it very much, especially when the organization grows. Think scale? Think ease of onboarding with face attendance. It becomes even more relevant when you are dealing with contract staff that changes on daily basis. The common bane in the construction industry! Step into the future Don’t hold yourself in the past. In the 21st century, getting an attendance machine is like buying a keypad based mobile. It is like using pigeons when you can use emails. Embrace technology that is light, portable and practical. Go touchless, go hardware-less. Read More: 5 Attendance compliances you can automate easily (like-never-before) How geo-fencing takes touchless attendance to the next level?
