If your business is located in Arizona, you must understand these laws to ensure that your employees have access to paid time off for various personal and family-related needs, promoting a healthy work-life balance. Read on to understand Arizona law on paid time off and how to ensure compliance and fair treatment in the workplace. As of 2024, no specific laws exist for paid time off in Arizona except paid sick leave. As an employer in the state, you must know the types of leaves considered as PTO and the rules around them. Table of Contents Laws for various types of leaves in Arizona 1. Sick leave 2. Vacation leave 3. Bereavement leave 4. Jury duty leave 5. Military leave 6. Voting leave 7. Holiday leave 8. Maternity, paternity, FMLA What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Arizona PTO law? What happens to roll over (carry over, brought forward) leaves? Payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination Arizona State Holidays for 2024 How can Truein help with Paid time-off management? Conclusion FAQs 1. How many sick days do employers have to provide in Arizona? 2. Which employers have to provide sick pay in Arizona? Laws for various types of leaves in Arizona 1. Sick leave In Arizona, employers with fewer than 15 employees must allow accrual or use of 24 hours of paid sick time annually. Employers with 15 or more employees must provide up to 40 hours of paid sick time per year. This is the general classification of the employers for mandatory sick PTO. It covers all employees – full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal staff. There can be exceptions, such as freelancers and government employees. Employers can select between two methods to provide sick leave. They can provide a lump-sum sick time off, providing the full required sick time at the beginning of the year. Alternatively, they can adopt the accrued sick time off model, where employees earn sick time at a rate of one hour per 30 hours worked. Calculating sick time pay should be at the employee’s regular hourly rate or a minimum wage, whichever is higher, irrespective of whether the employee is salaried, paid, or hourly. Arizona PTO law clearly states that employees should be able to use accrued sick leaves for mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, public health emergency, exposure to infectious disease, and situations related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The PTO law includes a comprehensive definition of family members for whom an employee can use sick leave, such as spouses, children, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings. 2. Vacation leave Arizona has no paid time off laws that mandate employees to provide vacation leave to employees. Still, most businesses offer vacation leave as part of the package to attract and retain employees. Employers have the discretion to establish their vacation policies. Arizona is one of the few states that allow “Use-it-or-lose-it” policies. However, if vacation leave is offered, employees must be provided a reasonable opportunity to use it. 3. Bereavement leave There is no state mandate for bereavement leave in Arizona. Employers can choose to offer bereavement leave. If you provide bereavement leave for the employees, you should provide all the information regarding its policies in the employment contract and employee handbook. While there are no Arizona PTO laws mandating bereavement leave, the employer must follow any established policies if offered during employment. 4. Jury duty leave Under federal labor law, every employee is protected when serving on jury duty in Arizona. Employers must provide unpaid leave for jury duty and pay a wage of $50 a day for the first 3 days of jury duty. Employees cannot be required to use other types of leave for jury duty and must be reinstated to their position upon return. If the company has five or fewer employees, and one employee is already serving jury duty, the court must postpone another employee’s jury duty. Violation of any of these provisions by an employer can result in a Class 3 misdemeanor. 5. Military leave Unpaid leave must be provided for National Guard or U.S. military members. In Arizona, employees have rights under federal (USERRA) and state law, including protection against employment discrimination due to military service. No employer can dissuade an employee from enlisting in the military by threatening economic harm. The Arizona state law extends all the rights provided by the USERRA. Public employees can be given paid military leave by their employers. 6. Voting leave Employees should be paid time off for voting in primary and general elections. In Arizona, employees must be given three consecutive hours to vote. Employers may specify the hours during which employees can take this leave. Giving paid time off for voting can result in a Class 2 misdemeanor. 7. Holiday leave Arizona law does not provide holiday leave on paid time off. As a result, private employers in the state are not required to provide paid or unpaid holiday leave. If you offer holiday leave, you must follow the established policy or employment contract you share with the employees. 8. Maternity, paternity, FMLA There are no specific state laws for maternity/paternity leave in Arizona. Employees are entitled to leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Pregnancy Disability Act. Arizona does follow the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), which provides protections for pregnant women against discrimination. Under FMLA, employers with more than 50 employees should provide leave for employees for medical reasons. Eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for specific family and medical reasons. What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Arizona PTO law? PTO laws in Arizona allow accrual of sick leaves, but there is no other mandate for employers to provide vacation leave, paid or unpaid. Consequently, there is no state-mandated system for the accrual of vacation leave. Employers can set their policies on the accrual of vacation leave. Employers providing accrual of vacation time should give access to the policies. These policies should provide information on how vacation time is accrued. Employers are also free to cap the number of annual vacation days accrued. However, no limit can be put on accrual of sick leave. Clear instructions on how employees earn vacation time should be provided in contracts and the employee handbook. Sick leaves should be allowed for carryover. Employers can also decide whether employees can carry over unused vacation time to the following year. Arizona allows employers to implement “use-it-or-lose-it” policies. These policies require employees to use their vacation time within a certain period or lose it. Whether accrued vacation time is paid out upon an employee’s termination depends on the company’s policy. Arizona PTO law doesn’t mandate payout of vacation time on termination. What happens to roll over (carry over, brought forward) leaves? In Arizona, the state’s paid sick leave laws outline the handling of rolled over (or carried over, brought forward) leaves, particularly for sick leave. But there is no provision for other types of leave rollover. Their policies are at the employer’s discretion. Arizona PTO payout laws mandate to allow employees to roll over unused sick time. The rollover amount is up to the employee’s total yearly eligibility. Depending on the employer’s size, it can be 24 or 40 hours a year. Another essential rule is while sick leave must be rolled over, employers in Arizona are not mandated to pay out unused paid sick leave upon the termination of an employee. Arizona allows “use-it-or-lose-it” policies, so employers can ask employees to use their vacation time within a certain period or forfeit it. Whatever policies an employer decides about the rollover of vacation time should be clearly outlined in employment contracts or employee handbooks. Also, the payout of unused vacation time upon termination is not mandatory and depends on the employer’s policy. Payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination An employer in Arizona can independently decide on the policies regarding the payment of accrued, unused vacation time upon termination of employment. This includes paid sick leave, as PTO laws in AZ do not mandate sick leave payout on termination of an employee. All policies regarding accruement and payment of vacation time should be clearly stated in the employee handbook or employment contract. If an employer has a policy or practice of paying out accrued vacation time upon termination, they are generally expected to apply this policy consistently to all employees. When an employee leaves the company, whether through resignation, termination, or retirement, the decision to pay out will depend on the agreed policies. To avoid misunderstandings, employers and employees in Arizona need to understand and communicate the company’s policy on this matter. Arizona State Holidays for 2024 There are no laws mandating employers to provide holiday leaves to employees. Private employers can legally ask employees to work on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or New Year holidays. In Arizona, employers are not required to pay extra for working legal holidays. Here’s a list of state holidays for 2024: Holiday Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. / Civil Rights Day Monday, January 15 Lincoln / Washington / President’s Day Monday, February 19 Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Juneteenth Wednesday, June 19 Independence Day Thursday, July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 Columbus Day Monday, October 14 Veterans Day Monday, November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 Christmas Day Wednesday, December 25 How can Truein help with Paid time-off management?

As the onus is on the employers to create policies for most types of PTO, understanding existing Florida PTO laws is vital to ensure employees get their rights and responsibilities regarding time off. To help employers better understand the Florida paid time off laws, we created this guide on various types of leave, from required holidays for public employers to non-required vacation leave for private sector employees. Understanding and complying with Florida’s PTO laws are essential to maintaining a fair and productive work environment. Let’s get started. Table of Contents Laws for Various Types of Leaves in Florida (A) Florida Required Leave 1. Holidays leave (Public Employers) 2. Parental and family medical leave 3. Jury service leave 4. Military service leave 5. Emergency response leave (B) Florida Non-required Leave 1. Vacation leave 2. Sick leave 3. Holidays leave (Private Employers) 4. Voting leave 5. Grief and bereavement leave (C) Other types of leaves 1. Maternity/paternity leave Overtime Regulations in Florida What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Florida PTO law? What happens to roll over (carry over, brought forward) leaves? How does quitting vs. being terminated affect the right to be paid out for unused time? Are There Federal Laws About Vacation Leave? Paid time off employer requirements Are use it or lose it policies legal in Florida? Florida State Holidays in 2024 How can Truein help with Paid time-off management? Conclusion FAQs 1. Can a Florida employer withhold part of a final PTO paycheck? Laws for Various Types of Leaves in Florida Florida PTO laws cover the required leaves in the state, but there are other types. We will cover all types of leaves and laws regarding them. (A) Florida Required Leave 1. Holidays leave (Public Employers) Public employers in Florida are mandated to provide paid holidays to their employees on state-declared holidays. Government authorities typically establish these holidays, including New Year’s Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other recognized public holidays. Not many states allow paid holiday leaves, but employers must give employees paid time off on designated holidays in Florida. You can check the Florida public holiday calendar 2024 at the end. 2. Parental and family medical leave Florida laws provide state employees the right to get up to six months of unpaid leave, but only after written proof of ailment from a physician. A public employee can utilize parental and family medical leave to attend to their family members’ medical and health needs, including parents, spouse, live-in partner, kids, and close family members. Parental leave gives employees the right to take time off to care for a newborn infant. Such a leave can be taken by either the father or the mother. No employer can terminate an employee for taking leave due to pregnancy or family medical requirements. 3. Jury service leave Florida PTO law mandates that employers provide their employees with time off for jury service without loss of pay. As every U.S. citizen must serve on a jury when summoned, Florida labor laws ensure no employer restrains employees from jury duty. Full-time public sector employees are not eligible for compensation for the first three days. After that, they will be compensated at a rate of $30 per day. Non-regular or part-time employees summoned for jury duty should receive $15 per day for the first three days of their service. From the fourth day, they should be paid $30 per day. Employers cannot penalize or discriminate against employees for serving on a jury. 4. Military service leave Florida follows federal regulations, particularly the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) for medical service leave. Under this law, employees are given employment protection and leave rights for serving in the military or National Guard. However, paid absence for military service leave cannot be extended to 240 hours per year in Florida. 5. Emergency response leave State agency workers in Florida can volunteer as emergency responders during natural disasters or other emergencies. Employers must grant paid leave to employees who serve as volunteer emergency responders for a maximum of 120 hours in a 12-month period. This allows employees to contribute to their communities in times of crisis without risking their job security. (B) Florida Non-required Leave 1. Vacation leave Florida PTO laws do not mandate paid vacation leave for employees in the private sector. Individual employers typically determine the availability of paid or unpaid vacation leave. They also set the policies that govern vacation leave. The same should be provided in employment contracts so employees know their rights. Employers can establish their policies regarding vacation accrual, usage, and eligibility criteria. 2. Sick leave Florida follows the federal quota for sick leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). It allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of sick leave provided the employee has worked up to 1 year or 1,250 hours in the previous year. And the employee should be working at a location where the employer has 50+ employees. Like vacation leave, Florida law does not require private employers to provide paid sick leave. The provision of sick leave, its accrual rates, and the terms for its use are typically at the employer’s discretion. 3. Holidays leave (Private Employers) Unlike public employers, private employers in Florida can decide whether to offer paid holidays to their employees. Employers can decide what holiday leaves are observed and whether they are paid or unpaid. Establishing holiday pay policies in the private sector is generally left to the employer’s discretion. 4. Voting leave Florida law grants private employees the right to take time off to vote in statewide elections like state employees. However, this time off is typically unpaid unless the employer offers to pay for voting leave. Employees who do not have three consecutive hours available outside of working hours in Florida are eligible for this unpaid voting leave. 5. Grief and bereavement leave Florida has no law mandating employers to provide grief or bereavement leave to employees. The availability of such leave and its terms are usually determined by an employer’s policies and employment contracts. Many employers in Canada offer a limited amount of paid or unpaid bereavement leave as a compassionate gesture. (C) Other types of leaves 1. Maternity/paternity leave As per law, Florida allows employees 12 weeks of unpaid maternity/paternity leave. Many employers offer maternity leave as part of their employee benefits package, and the terms and duration of such leave can vary significantly. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and for the employee’s serious health condition. However, not all employers are required to comply with FMLA; only those with 50 or more employees are required to comply. Florida has no specific paternity leave law that requires employers to provide paid or unpaid leave for new fathers. Employers may require employees to use accrued time to offer paternity leave. Additionally, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) forbids employers to discriminate based on pregnancy in any way. Pregnant employees cannot be fired, hired, or unfairly treated due to their pregnancy. However, PDA applies to employers with more than 15 employees. Overtime Regulations in Florida There are no separate overtime regulations in Florida, and employers must follow the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) rules. Employees working more than 40 hours a week should be paid one and a half times the regular wage rate for extra hours worked. Employers cannot set rules and standards regarding minimum wage, overtime pay, and other wage-related matters. Under the FLSA, certain employees are “exempt” and are not eligible for overtime pay. This usually includes administrators, executives, and some sales professionals. The non-exempt employees in Florida are entitled to overtime pay at one and a half times their regular hourly rate for each hour worked beyond 40 in a workweek. For example, if an employee’s regular hourly wage is $10 per hour, they would receive $15 per hour for each overtime hour worked. Employers should refer to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) updates on the minimum salary threshold for exempt employees. What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Florida PTO law? Accrual is not obligatory under the Florida PTO payout laws. Employers are free to determine the accrual of vacation time for employees. Without a mandated accrual system under Florida state law, the offerings can vary significantly between employers. Employers can decide how employees earn vacation days. It may be based on their length of service with the company or the number of hours worked. For instance, an employee might accrue a certain number of hours of vacation leave for every 40 hours worked. Additionally, employers can limit the number of vacation days an employee can accrue. Once employees reach this limit, they stop accruing additional vacation days until they use some of their accrued time. What happens to roll over (carry over, brought forward) leaves? Florida legally allows use-it-or-lose-it policies. Employers have the freedom to decide whether to allow roll over or not. They can implement policies that require employees to use their accrued vacation time within a specified timeframe, often by the end of the calendar year. Unused vacation days may not carry over into the following year, meaning employees lose them if they do not use them within the designated period. How does quitting vs. being terminated affect the right to be paid out for unused time? As there are no Florida PTO payout laws, how the payout is handled based on how the employee is terminated depends entirely on company policies. Employers should provide employees with clear guidelines on how the payout will be handled if they resign or are terminated. The same information must be provided in employment contracts and employee handbooks. Are There Federal Laws About Vacation Leave? No federal laws in the United States specifically require employers to provide paid vacation leave to their employees. Unless an employee has formally offered vacation time to the employees, they are not obligated to provide any paid or unpaid vacation time. The law states that federal law must be observed without any state on employment practices (FLSA in this case). However, FLSA has no provision for paid vacation leave that employers must provide to their workers. Paid time off employer requirements In Florida, there are no such paid time off employer requirements. However, employers should follow federal laws wherever applicable. For instance, there is no legal obligation to offer paid time off, but most employers in Florida offer PTO in good faith. Additionally, the length of paid time off depends on the company’s policies unless it falls under FMLA eligibility, which offers up to 12 weeks paid for eligible employees. Are use it or lose it policies legal in Florida? As of 2024, “use it or lose it” policies, which require employees to use their accrued paid time off (PTO) by a specific deadline or forfeit it, are legal in Florida. Employers have full discretion to decide policies regarding “use it or lose it” rules for their employees. Florida State Holidays in 2024 Holidays falling on Sunday will be observed on Monday, while holiday leaves that fall on Saturday are observed on Friday. Holiday Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Independence Day Thursday, July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 Veterans’ Day Monday, November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 Thanksgiving Friday Friday, November 29 Christmas Day Wednesday, Dec. 25 How can Truein help with Paid time-off management?

Can a Florida employer withhold part of a final PTO paycheck?

However, in most cases, employers cannot withhold part of the payout such that the pay rate falls below the minimum wage rate. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?
