What Is Workforce Management and How To Improve It? July 23, 2024 The last two years saw global workforces struggle to keep afloat. The pandemic highlighted the importance of workforce management as companies adapted new work models. In all the chaos, the responsibilities of HR professionals were significantly changed as they have to ensure good workforce management. A lot has to be done to ensure that employees are managed to keep business operations up and running. Workforce management (WFM) systems existed before the pandemic, but they became much more evident, prompting companies and organizations to focus on effective workforce management. In this article, we will take a closer look at the importance of workforce management and how to improve it. Table of Contents What is workforce management? How does workforce management work? 1.Forecasting the employees and budgeting 2. Staff scheduling according to availability 3. Tracking time and attendance 4. Vacation and leave planning of employees 5. Check employee performance and reports What are the benefits of workforce management? 1. Improves productivity 2. Reduce overstaffing and overtime 3. Payroll with better accurate data 4. Automation of HR process How to choose a workforce management solution? Conclusion What is workforce management? Workforce management is a set of processes and procedures used within an organization to increase the productivity and efficiency of the workers. All software firms in manufacturing industries employ WFM to optimize their business processes. Workforce management is a broad term that encompasses many other activities. Its primary focus is to enable all possible opportunities to maintain a productive workforce. There are several workforce processes involved in WFM, including: Human resource management (HRM) Human capital management (HCM) Performance management Data collection and analytics Manpower budgeting and forecasting Workforce management largely resembles human capital management’s tasks, where employee recruitment, management, and development are concentrated. The difference lies in the focus of WFM activities on maximizing employee performance and productivity while HCM is solely focused on ROI. For any company, workforce management is essential. It ensures workers are performing at an optimum pace without strenuous work shifts. Companies that employ workforce management tools to track work in real-time can increase production and revenue multifold. How does workforce management work? Workforce management starts with employee hiring and ends with forecasting, including everything in between. A successful workforce management process is made up of several processes. HR managers are responsible for managing all the tasks related to workforce management . However, it might not be possible to perform all the workforce management tasks alone. You might have to partner with department leaders and the analytics team to ensure critical initiatives run smoothly. To ensure that you are meeting the workforce management targets, you must understand the key elements and create solutions to implement them for your workforce. Here are the most important task involved in workforce management. 1.Forecasting the employees and budgeting Workforce management provides a lot of historical data that can be used to forecast when labor demands will change. Such employee forecasting can help optimize deployment and balance workload. Every business has peak hours when there is a requirement for much more workers than at other times. For retail stores, this is the time during the holidays, and for manufacturing companies, it is when a large number of orders are to be processed. Workforce management processes can forecast high turnover rates, drop productivity or profits, prepare for events when the workload is significantly impacted, and examine past data for accurate labor and resource estimates. Human capital is the most costly and variable expense for almost every company. You can budget the employees’ hiring, retention, and management with workforce planning. As WFM automates scheduling, it helps organizations adhere to labor laws and ensures that too much is not spent on overtime costs. Several studies show that workforce management offers the highest return on all HR investments. 2. Staff scheduling according to availability Besides automatic time and attendance tracking, workforce management also helps correctly forecast and schedule staffing needs. Whether an organization has multiple staffing levels or fewer employees, shift scheduling can be complex, requiring many resources. Staff scheduling ensures that all the variables such as vacation, availability, workload, and absences are considered when shift schedules are made. The primary responsibilities included in workforce management scheduling are managing the number of workers available, resolving overstaffing or understaffing issues, and forecasting for team growth. For any organization, a reliable scheduling system must be in place to ensure an understaffed workforce does not affect productivity during critical times. It also provides opportunities to discover the overstaffing in the workforce to ensure revenue is not lost in hiring more than required workers. 3. Tracking time and attendance Time tracking might seem simple enough, but there is a lot involved than just managing timesheets. Manual time and attendance recording are highly cumbersome. For efficiency, you require reliable employee time tracking software . When you use an automated attendance system like Truein, you can access analytics that helps identify absenteeism , overtime, and undertime patterns. By ensuring a reliable time and attendance tracking process in your organization, you provide: Future workload forecasting An appropriate number of workers are available at all times Delegate tasks correctly Effective employee time tracking is also helpful in time management and boosting workforce productivity. 4. Vacation and leave planning of employees As part of WFM, HR managers must perform payroll duties and leave management . Any workforce management plan largely depends on the employees’ availability, including their day-to-day availability. Maintaining a proper record of vacation and leave is essential for workforce management. Furthermore, it helps with analyzing labor costs, tracking paid time off , offering incentives to employees like happy hours, and ensuring the number of workers available during shifts. Vacation and leave planning go beyond deciding the paychecks; it greatly benefits employee performance and morale. 5. Check employee performance and reports Another process involved in workforce management is employee performance and report reviews. Generating performance reports is time-consuming, but it is essential for evaluating performance, productivity, and overall employee experience. As part of WFM, HR managers perform several evaluations by tracking employee timing, measuring employee activity, and gauging customer experience and satisfaction. Every company and team has a different way of managing team performance, but quarterly performance reviews are the best way to achieve results. Performance reviews help employers keep the work quality high and allow employees to evaluate their performance and improve under-constructive environments. What are the benefits of workforce management? By implementing a comprehensive workforce management system, you can empower your workforce to impact productivity and profits. But by successfully putting the workforce management processes in place, HR managers can drastically impact a wide range of business operations. Here are some of the benefits of workforce management for a company. 1. Improves productivity There is no better way to put productivity at its peak than to delegate and communicate the work to the employees effectively. By tracking time, forecasting workload, reviewing performance, paying fairly, and enabling efficient communication, workforce management can help the team to boost productivity. This improved productivity affects the amount of work delivered and positively impacts the quality of work. Effective workforce management creates a productivity win-win for employees and employers. Such productivity comes without stressing out workers to work overtime or disturbing their work-life balance. 2. Reduce overstaffing and overtime By automating employee time tracking, scheduling, and payroll, companies save work hours, make life easier for managers, and also help reduce overstaffing and overtime. Workforce management processes can provide you with definitive data that you need to adjust staffing levels per the situation. When a company can forecast the ebbs and flows of the workload, it can drastically reduce staffing costs and micromanage overtime expenditure. It helps save essential resources and invest them in the growth of the business. 3. Payroll with better accurate data One of the benefits of workforce management is that it entirely automates the payroll and increases its efficiency by providing accurate data. It also eliminates costly human errors and compliance risks. Managers can minimize the time spent on tedious payroll processes and better focus on more productive activities. This automation ultimately shows that workers are paid accurately for the number of hours they work. It boosts their morale and builds trust in the employer. All these outcomes significantly improve the quality of work and pump up the revenue stream. 4. Automation of HR process An efficient workforce management results in the automation of HR processes. It improves communication and encourages managers to make independent decisions regarding their teams that can help streamline the workforce. With HR workflows being automated, it helps keep the quality standards high at all levels. It also helps maximize resource utilization, and managers can increase the amount of work without increasing labor costs. Automation of HR also ensures that there is no wastage of resources, tangible or intangible. It also improves the efficiency of managers and supervisors, making them much more productive. How to choose a workforce management solution? The most efficient way to handle workforce management is to adopt workforce management software. It provides the necessary automation to boost productivity, eliminate redundancies, and lower the margin of human error. Several workforce management solutions are available, but your choice must depend on its features. In workforce management, you must conduct time tracking and shift scheduling, ensure open communication, manage human capital, and do talent acquisition and employee engagement. Choose a solution that enables automation of all workforce management processes.

It may be true that your business is unique in its operations or staffing requirement. Still, improving facility management can help you to improve your organization’s overall operating cost and can facilitate employees to work more productively. You have to accept that facility management is an ever-evolving process. The facility demands change as your business grows, or new roles and procedures are added. This is why facility managers must stay up-to-date with facility management best practices. Here we are sharing some ideas on how to improve facility management services. Table of Contents 6 Facilities Management Improvement Ideas 1. Lower operation costs with preventive measures What is preventive maintenance? 2. Set a customized facilities management operations plan that fits your organization's needs 3. Communicate with your employees 4. Set clear definitions for facilities' work practices 5. Develop employee skills 6. Automate and streamline facilities management operations Conclusion 6 Facilities Management Improvement Ideas 1. Lower operation costs with preventive measures One of the core responsibilities of your role as a facility manager will be to strive for optimum efficiency of operation of all the assets to cut the maintenance cost to a minimum. One of the critical facilities management improvement strategies to employ here is to implement preventive maintenance. What is preventive maintenance? Preventive maintenance is proactive actions taken by facility managers to extend the life of equipment within a facility and reduce downtime. It is opposed to reactive maintenance when you respond to any malfunction, but you must stop the operations from doing maintenance. It costs revenue and productivity. You need to invest in intelligent solutions like IoT for facility management to track metrics and access maintenance schedule KPI analytics that help you make data-driven decisions and reduce reactive maintenance costs. Organizations that effectively deploy preventive maintenance plans reportedly save 12%-18% on annual maintenance expenses. Preventive measures also ensure that your facilities provide a safe work environment. If left unattended, faulty equipment can cause workplace accidents, endangering staff. Furthermore, facility maintenance managers must keep things charted to avoid later overwhelming maintenance. It would help if you routinely replaced old hardware and equipment like lights, wiring, and motors to fix wear and tear and keep things running smoothly. Also, adopt eco-friendly practices like using LED lights, biodegradable materials, and saving power and water. 2. Set a customized facilities management operations plan that fits your organization's needs Facility management is not the same for every organization. This is why you must access your business model to understand your organization’s priorities – preventive maintenance, event scheduling, asset management, workforce training, etc. The workflow you create for facility management must be tailored to accommodate your organization’s unique facility maintenance needs.

Set clear definitions for facilities' work practices Your workers are your greatest asset. You need to ask yourself how to improve facilities management by optimizing their performance repeatedly. As a start, you can create and share facility work practices with the employees, so they know their roles and responsibilities. Be descriptive about their functions and how their role affects the others within the team. Also, the impact their performance makes on the overall efficiency of the facility. Employees should be provided with detailed policies on work schedules and attendance. There must not be any confusion among the workers. Company expectations from them should be conveyed. Employees should be aware of any disciplinary actions that can be taken against them if they fail to comply with attendance policies . As a facility manager, you should ensure that all work and shift schedule policies comply with federal, state, and local employment and labor laws. You can also use a labor attendance app to track your contractual workers’ attendance. All of this is a necessity to provide facility management at its best. 5.

Time is a valuable resource, and proper time management can help improve productivity and profit. The lack of understanding of time management in the workplace leads to inefficiency. If your organization frequently struggles with employee efficiency and productivity issues, then poor time management can be the reason. This article will explain the importance of time management in a business environment and explore ways companies can prioritize effective time management. Table of Contents What is Time Management? 4 importance of time management in a workplace 1. It helps to deliver work on time 2. Increase employee productivity and efficiency 3. Reduces stress and anxiety of employees 4. Balance employees' work and life How to improve time management in the workplace 1. Plan all your work and task well in time 2.

Time management is planning and managing an organization’s work schedule to help boost productivity. It helps plan and prioritize tasks so that most critical tasks are completed within the deadline without overly exerting pressure on workers. Time management aims to ensure that the workers utilize time to accomplish the tasks they are given with less effort. HR managers are responsible for controlling the shift schedule ; time management can give them the much-needed capabilities to make the work environment productive and achieve better productivity in less time and without stress. When workers slack off at work, or there are task delays for no reason, time management can help increase efficiency and plug any productivity loopholes. 4 importance of time management in a workplace 1. It helps to deliver work on time The importance of time management is evident from how easy it becomes to deliver work without delays. Proper time management is highly effective in managing the workload and ensuring that workers are not feeling stressed at work. Often when the managers and supervisors are not managing time effectively, they fail to provide a smooth workflow for workers. It is one of the most significant reasons why workers feel burnout. When there are time-boxed tasks, workers follow the structure and accomplish the allotted task within the desired timeframe. This results in productivity and efficiency without causing anxiety or confusion. Companies that can help workers deliver work on time can increase their revenues multifold. 2. Increase employee productivity and efficiency Practical time management skills are necessary to be productive and efficient at work. Companies that can ensure effective time management within the workforce can deliver quality results without compromising the quality of the workplace environment. Another importance of time management skills is that it helps employees finish a task as early as possible without overstretching themselves. The organization’s overall productivity goes up, resulting in reduced overtime expenditure. Effective time management requires managers and supervisors to prioritize tasks as per importance and urgency. It helps workers to focus on an important task that improves their work quality. The improved focus builds momentum that ensures workers are productive throughout the shifts. 3. Reduces stress and anxiety of employees The overwhelmed workforce is neither productive nor focused on providing quality tasks. Poor time management often leads to lacking shift scheduling. Workers might be working too many hours frequently, affecting their productivity and well-being. Companies with poor shift scheduling suffer from severe productivity issues, and their workers are highly dissatisfied at work. Excessive stress and hypertension can lead to heart diseases, depression, and obesity. It is the responsibility of the employers to ensure that there exists no unnecessary stress and tensions in the workplace for workers. 4. Balance employees' work and life The importance of time management at the workplace is not only to improve the quality of work life, but it can also benefit the life of workers outside the workplace. When employees can keep things under control on the professional front, they get more time to focus on their personal lives and ensure a proper balance between work and life. It is a fulfilling experience encouraging them to do better at their jobs. When workers know the tasks and know they can accomplish them within the given time frame, they feel a sense of calmness. This improves their quality of life as they are less stressed and happier. How to improve time management in the workplace 1. Plan all your work and task well in time Planning is the first step toward time management at the workplace. When you are planning your work and tasks before executing your plan, you are better positioned to accomplish the tasks without stressing out over a limited time. Planning is one of the critical time management skills for workplace success as it allows you to look over a strict routine and work smarter. You can decide which tasks require most of your time and how much you can accomplish within a day. Time management ensures you make smarter decisions every time without losing focus or compromising on work quality. According to the best-selling workplace author Brian Tracy, “Every minute you spend in planning saves 10 minutes in execution; this gives you a 1,000 percent Return on Energy.” 2. Prioritize the important work Another critical factor of successful time management skills is prioritizing the work list. When you sort through the available tasks, arrange them in a list based on priority. You have limited work time and can only focus on a few daily tasks. Prioritization is how you ensure that the critical tasks are completed on time. Not everything you do at work is of the same importance. Focusing on the essential tasks first ensures that you have high output. When you can figure out the most critical tasks that need to be completed urgently, you will be able to focus on what needs to be done. You can take the assistance of project management tools for this. 3. Stop multitasking Common myth employees suffer from is that multitasking can help them achieve more in less time. Several studies have shown that less than 2.5% of people can multitask effectively; the rest waste time trying to do several things simultaneously. Workers trying too many things end up achieving nothing at all. The best way to be most productive is to take one task at a time and complete it before jumping to the next task. As mentioned above, prioritize the essential tasks and cut them off the list. This is how you can focus on the task and complete it without errors. 4. Cut off all your distraction Distractions are everywhere, be it in personal or professional life. When you are distracted, you lose valuable hours of your day without accomplishing the tasks. Smartphones make it even more challenging to focus on work as we are continuously disturbed by notifications. Chatty workers and social media are other common distractions at work that waste hours. You have to be self-disciplined enough not to let such distractions affect your performance or productivity at work. The easiest way to remove these distractions is to take some time to evaluate the culture at work and understand what’s wasting your time. Please turn off your phone notifications and only check them at a fixed time during the day. All these steps will help you remain productive and focused at work without being distracted. 5. Use a time and attendance management software Companies can utilize time and attendance management software to ensure that things are monitored and managed effectively. Time management is essential in the workplace for employers and employees. Automated attendance management software tools allow employee time tracking that can help significantly improve the time management skills of HR managers. Depending on your needs, you can chose from many attendance apps for employees . Intelligent time management is necessary to ensure you keep productivity high without compromising the work culture quality. In the absence of a time tracking tool , you are at a disadvantage as you do not know where is the workers’ time going or who is lenient with work and shifts. How can Truein help?

How To Create 24-Hour Shift Schedules? May 20, 2024 Businesses that are always open/functional have different governance requirements. Running a business 24/7 requires you to maintain a 24-hour shift schedule. It demands the availability of workers at work at all times, prompting scheduling challenges. An easy solution seems to confide in night shifts, but it can demoralize the workforce if they are scheduled to work night shifts. The secret of successful shift schedules for 24/7 coverage lies in equity. You have to figure out how to swap and rotate 24-hour shifts that do not leave your employees mentally or physically exhausted. Also, the best shift schedule for 24/7 coverage has the flexibility to accommodate changes in production peak. Table of Contents Things to consider before creating a 24 hours shift schedule schedule 1. The business type 2. Number of employees 3. Coverage requirements 4. Shift duration 5. Time Off Four 24-hour shift schedule examples 1. Fixed shifts 2. Rotating shifts 3. Swing shifts 4. DuPont Shift Schedule Automatic shift scheduling with Truein Conclusion Things to consider before creating a 24 hours shift schedule schedule Before we share tips on making a 24-hour shift schedule, it is essential to understand the requirements. Shift schedules are never one-fits-all; you have to consider the unique needs of your business. Here are the vital factors. 1. The business type Different businesses have different requirements. For instance, a 24-hour shift schedule is common in restaurants, hospitals, manufacturing, and construction businesses. However, all these businesses differ significantly in terms of skills and the number of workers required. Why you want to maintain a 24/7 work routine will decide the schedule structure. Hospitality and medical categories need staff in lesser numbers as compared to construction and manufacturing industries. 2. Number of employees The maximum number of workers you can hire and maintain will decide how to plan the shifts for round-the-clock timing. For instance, if your organization has only 30 employees and your business model requires at least 15 workers to be present in one shift, then for a 24-hour work schedule, you will need two 12-hour shifts. 3. Coverage requirements If your business has rush hours, like in restaurants or over a certain period, the production at your manufacturing unit peaks, and you will need more than the required number of workers. Again, you must consider the coverage requirements before planning the final 24-hour schedule. If the peak hours are not regular, like in restaurants, you can decide to go with contractual workers for a specific period. 4. Shift duration The best shift schedule for 24/7 coverage is one that minimizes overtime costs. You have to work out a schedule plan such that the overtime is under control. We already have a great resource for managing overtime and creating an excellent employee overtime policy . Here the goal should be to limit the length of each shift to 8 hours to avoid overtime. You can extend the shift duration to 10 or 12 hours if there are not enough employees to cover the 8-hour shift scheduling . Also, if your cover requirements demand more work hours, you can extend the shift period. 5. Time Off The problem with operating your business 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is that you might have revenue flowing in, but it is easy to forget about the staff. Your workers are not there to work 24/7 and need time off. After the payment, workers’ primary concern is when and how they will get the time off. Most employees working night shifts expect time off to complete their sleep or take mini-vacations. You can consider offering employees at least one of the weekends off during night shifts so they can catch up with their family and friends. Also, there are labor compliance requirements around 24/7 work shifts, don’t forget to consider those. Managers must understand the difference between a reasonable ask – mandating workers to work in a particular schedule – and putting workers at risk of burnout, fatigue, absenteeism , or poor performance. As manager scheduling shifts, you must be mindful of working in shifts’ physical and emotional stresses. Now that you understand what requirements must be examined before creating shift schedules for 24/7 coverage, we will explore the most commonly implemented shift patterns for 24/7 coverage. Four 24-hour shift schedule examples 1. Fixed shifts It’s the easiest route to maintain a specific shift. In fixed shifts, employees will always work the same shift they are put into. When you retain fixed shifts, you can hire and staff the shifts per the business’s demand. If there is a spike, you can hire part-time workers to fill the void. Fixed shifts are easy for managers to maintain, and some employees prefer them because their biological cycles are not disturbed by frequent changes between days and nights. Even customers will get used to dealing with the same employees at the same time of the day. The problem is if any worker is not satisfied with their shift, they will not be able to request a change. Fixed shifts work well for businesses of any size; however, you must maintain more than the minimum number of employees. Because employees will need time off in fixed schedules and you will need extra workers to cover the shift. 2. Rotating shifts Rotating shifts are more equitable as they allow employees to work in different shifts rotating after several weeks. No employee gets the “good” or “bad” shifts here, and every worker has to work day, night, and afternoon shifts. There are several variations of the 24-hour rotating shift. You can keep the rotation constant; for instance, the shift changes weekly. However, this can be hard on employees as their bodies continuously try to adapt physically and mentally. As the title suggests, a slow 24-hour rotating shift rotates slower, sometimes over months, so that employees can adapt to the shift change. Most restaurants and hospitality businesses maintain weekend rotation, where employees take a turn working weekend shifts. It is common in smaller firms where there is not enough staff. Finally, some businesses maintain partial rotating shifts where some employees have fixed shifts while others rotate. 3. Swing shifts Swing shifts are for businesses where a steady output or coverage is inevitable, like in the manufacturing and mining sector. In the swing method, shift schedules for 24/7 coverage have different starting and stopping points. Employees don’t have to stick to a set start-stop time. For example, instead of the usual 8-4, 4-12, and 12-8 shifts, the schedule can be 9-5, 11-7, and so on. Swing shifts are also implemented where an employee must be available to carry over one shift to the next. It makes shift transition smoother, like powerhouses or employees handling CNC machines in a manufacturing unit. However, keep in mind that swing shifts require more employees due to many staggered shifts. 4. DuPont Shift Schedule The DuPont 12-hour rotating shift pattern requires four teams who will work in two 12-hour shifts to provide 24-hour coverage. Here, you are required to maintain a 4-week cycle where each team works 4 consecutive night shifts, followed by 3 days off duty, then 3 consecutive day shifts, followed by 1 day off duty. 3 consecutive night shifts follow this, and then 3 days off duty, works 4 consecutive day shifts, and 7 consecutive days off duty. In total, on average, workers work 42 hours per week in DuPont’s 24-hour shift schedule. One of the greatest per of this shift pattern is that employees get a week off each cycle. Automatic shift scheduling with Truein Without a doubt, managing a 24-hour shift schedule can be complicated. If HR managers are left with manual tools to make a 24-hour shift schedule, it can take a lot of resources and time.

For any organization or business, employees are the greatest assets. The challenges and nuances of efficient employee scheduling must be addressed to keep them happy and engaged at work. There is much to deal with scheduling needs, leave and time-off requests, worker demands, and payroll requirements. When juggling many responsibilities, common employee scheduling problems are likely to occur. But as a manager, it is your responsibility to make it possible for workers to maintain a balanced work schedule. The staff scheduling problem is much more common for organizations still managing everything manually. According to market research , manual scheduling is the most common reason for scheduling problems, errors, and employee dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the study found: 20% of HR managers’ time is wasted creating work schedules 140 hours are lost annually on manual employee scheduling 174% more turnover occurs due to errors from manual schedule creation It is evident that digitization of employee scheduling is mandatory now; there are some common employee scheduling problems you must be familiar with. Here we are listing some commonly occurring scheduling problems and their solutions. Table of Contents 1. Not utilizing modern technology 2. Shortage of employees 3. Unequal shift distribution 4. Last-minute employee absences 5. Overscheduling employees 6. Vacations and time off Conclusion 1. Not utilizing modern technology Pen and paper are no longer viable for managing the workforce. Even if you have a small business to operate, manual employee scheduling is prone to issues and miscommunication. It requires a lot of following up, back-and-forth calls, and messages which is incredibly time-consuming and inefficient.

Shortage of employees An employee scheduling problem will likely occur if your organization has a staff shortage. To keep things running smoothly, you need enough employees to cover all the shifts and also cover for employees who call in sick or are on vacation. Understaffed operations result in an overworked and unsatisfied workforce and poor customer service. The solution to the problem is to hire more workers or optimize the existing workforce. The first option is relatively straightforward; you can fill the gap in the shifts by hiring full-time or part-time employees. However, it’s an additional cost, and if the requirement is temporary, it can result in overstaffing later. Optimizing the workforce with software like Truein can solve this issue. You can automate processes, maintain compliance, and always have real-time data of available workers. This will empower you to deal with staff shortages. 3. Unequal shift distribution Playing favorites when employee scheduling might not be on your mind, but subconsciously you might pick certain workers for tasks you think best match their skills. However, putting them in a particular shift every time will send the wrong message. Other workers will feel that you are favoring some workers over others. Again, automated employee scheduling software can help avoid such a staff scheduling problem. It can ensure that no employee gets a ‘good’ shift every time, and similarly, no worker is stuck with a ‘bad’ shift. Furthermore, employee scheduling software can help you comply with federal, state, and local labor laws. Such optimization ensures that there is never unequal shift distribution. 4. Last-minute employee absences Life is unpredictable, and no matter how well planned your shift schedule is, personal problems can get in the way of work anytime. Sick kids, illnesses, accidents, or unforeseen obstacles can result in last-minute employee absences. When such an event occurs, the worse thing is to panic. The solution here is to identify the workers who can fill the shift. You can quickly look through Truein’s employee roster to find which employees are scheduled to work in that particular shift or before. You can ask them if they can put in extra hours (overtime), suggest days off, or shorten the shifts for the rest of the days instead of covering for the absent worker. If no such employee is available, you can contact off-duty workers regarding shift change. 5. Overscheduling employees The efficiency of the workforce depends on how well rested the workers are. If you expect 100% efficiency from them, you have to ensure that you are not overscheduling employees. Federal and state regulations make it mandatory that employees must be given eight hours between shifts; it is not an application for all employees, such as temporary staff. Also, at times managers scrunch shifts together accidentally. In the real world, employees have to commute to and from work, take care of chores at home, and catch up with friends and family. This leaves them with less-than-optimal time to take rest if their shifts are scheduled for more than 8 hours. The solution to this common employee scheduling problem is maintaining at least 12 hours gap between shifts. If it’s not possible in your organization to keep a difference of 12 hours, try to arrange staff scheduling so that workers get two days off together. The extended period will allow them to decrease their sleep deficit. 6. Vacations and time off Every worker deserves time off from work to balance work and personal life. When too focused on productivity, revenue and profits, it is easy to not care for employees’ vacation time or time off. All employees must be given this incentive. To cover for the employees who take time off, you can cross-train the workers such there is always staff available to take responsibility in the absence of other employees. You can also incentivize employees to cover for other workers by offering bonuses, increased pay rates, or more time off. Conclusion It may not be possible to avoid employee scheduling problems altogether, but they can be managed. It all depends on how effectively you manage your workforce. This guide will help you avoid the most common staff scheduling problems. We recommend Truein for employee scheduling. You can create, change, and publish schedules almost instantly. No longer excel sheets or additional hardware is needed; you can deploy the best employee scheduling solution with this cloud-based time and attendance software .

How To Create A Staff Deployment Plan? July 24, 2024 A staff deployment plan differs in every organization depending on the requirement and other factors. Most managers use staffing deployment plans only to identify the headcount additions and reductions when much more can be achieved. If you are creating a staff deployment plan, you should know what questions to ask to clearly understand the current state of the workforce, the desired future state, and how to get there. In this article, we’ll explore how managers can create a staff deployment plan best suited for your business’s particular needs. Table of Contents What is a staff deployment plan? Benefits of the employee deployment plan 1. It saves time 2. No worry of shortage of employees or no employees for a particular task 3. Work gets completed on time How to create a staff deployment plan 1. Evaluate the staffing goals 2. Assign roles to the employees 3. Provide training to employees for the work 4. Monitor performance Conclusion What is a staff deployment plan? A staff deployment plan is a process that provides flexible multi-channel workforce forecasting. With effective staff deployment planning, companies can ensure that there is an accurate representation of work and employees and workload is evenly distributed and meets the budgetary goals. A staff deployment plan is how you can decide the best possible employee schedule . It also fully leverages the employee skillsets to balance the workload and gives an optimized shift schedule by accounting for variables such as payroll requirements, employee availabilities, budgetary objectives, company requirements, and other policies. With workforce deployment, an organization can align the company’s goals, customers’ expectations, and the employees’ career needs. A staff deployment plan transforms the scheduling process from a necessary, tedious, and clerical chore into a cost-effective, analytical, and proactive business management process. Benefits of the employee deployment plan While managers will need to spend significant time crafting a quality staff deployment plan, it is still worth the investment of resources. It is because the outcome offers many advantages. Here are the key benefits of an employee deployment plan: 1. It saves time A deployment plan is not only for scheduling optimization but also provides employees with a clear description of what they need to do. It is also a great document to assist in onboarding new hires as they are less likely to commit mistakes at work. It saves time as managers and supervisors don’t have to spend time making corrections or altering the shift schedules. Deployment plans are highly effective in ensuring that employees work on tasks correctly. HR managers are free from repeated tasks of adjusting shift schedules to ensure high productivity. They can invest the time saved in making crucial business operation decisions that directly contribute to revenues and profits. 2. No worry of shortage of employees or no employees for a particular task When you utilize software solutions like Truein to keep track of the workers, you are in a better position to schedule shifts, distribute workload, and keep productivity high at all times. Understaffing or overstaffing are both problematic for a company. If you regularly struggle with a shortage of employees, not only will the production levels be hurt, but you will also face difficulties on other fronts. Workers will be overworked if there is a shortage, and you might be forced to give tasks to employees who are not appropriately skilled to handle them. Staff deployment plans free you from such issues. You can forecast if there will be an increase in demand for labor or workers ahead. 3. Work gets completed on time With the correct number of shift workers, you can ensure that the work is done on time. Staff deployment plans can inform about the gap in the skillset in the workforce such that you can train employees accordingly. Cross-training employees is an effective way to make sure you always have workers available to substitute for other workers. How to create a staff deployment plan 1. Evaluate the staffing goals Like any other planning task, the first step in developing a staff deployment plan is to evaluate the organization’s needs. You have to recognize the targets you want to achieve and write them down such that employees can work towards them. HR managers are responsible for evaluating the goals and identifying the support needed to meet those goals. When you clearly understand the staff deployment plan requirements, you can better align departmental goals with the organization’s goals. For this step, you must reach other leaders to understand their expectations from the departments for the coming year or new strategic initiatives they plan to undertake that will require staffing adjustments. Here are some critical questions that can help you identify significant goals: What primary strategic or tactical goals the company wants to implement for the upcoming year? How will HR managers support these goals? What goals do you need to set for your team such that your team is aligned with the company’s goal? What staffing changes will need to be worked on to ensure enough workforce to make these goals possible? How will you ensure that other departments support each other to achieve the end goals? 2. Assign roles to the employees After you identify the goals correctly, the next step is to assign roles to the employees. First, evaluate the current staffing state and create an inventory of the skillset at play. The staff deployment plan must support future goals by availing the right talent at the right time. To effectively assign roles to employees, you will need information like current staff, contingency workers, and other contractual staff available to fill in the gaps. In addition, you must know about their skillsets and the role they perform within the company. Manually it is impossible to keep track of all this information which is why you need automated tools like Truein. Truein is a complete employee time and attendance system that offers shift scheduling solutions . It is a cloud-based, AI-powered face recognition attendance system that allows managers and supervisors to create and share shift schedules with workers. It will enable workers to record their attendance and confirm their availability for shift directly from the Truein app on their smartphones. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 3. Provide training to employees for the work If you find a skill gap after listing goals and matching them against the available workforce inventory, you need to plan ways to bridge the gap. Whether you find inadequate staffing, lack of expertise, or simply wrong employees being put in the wrong place, you can fix the issues by providing training to employees. Analysis of the workforce will help you identify the deficiencies in the current state of employees. It is your responsibility as an HR manager to address the skill deficiencies that can hinder the success of the goals outlined in the staff deployment plan. Please do not view the skill gap as a weakness of the current teams but rather as an opportunity to help employees evolve in their roles to better align with future organizational goals. 4. Monitor performance Once you have successfully decided the end goals of the staff deployment plan, created shift schedules, and matched workers with the right skills with the tasks, the last phase is to monitor the workers’ performance. Your staff deployment plan must monitor the end-state and interim staffing. You must ensure that employees are not struggling with performance and can complete tasks on time. If there is a skill gap, consider retraining the employees whenever required. Any successful deployment plan must outline when the staff is needed, at what time, and location. It should also differentiate full-time versus contractual staff and identify the critical roles based on the skill set. Conclusion A staff deployment plan is one of the essential components of workforce planning. It is the first step an organization can take towards evolving its existence and helping employees adapt to the changing needs of the business. We hope this guide will provide you with enough insights to help you create an effective staff deployment plan that considers more than the headcount and includes additional complexities such as skill sets, end goals, and long-term strategic plans.

Why Automatic Scheduling Is Better Than Regular Scheduling? July 24, 2024 At any company, scheduling employees and their tasks are one of HR managers’ core responsibilities. It is a crucial management function that ensures enough workers are available to keep the business operations running. Shift scheduling is essential but time-consuming and tedious when the number of workers to manage is high. Many companies are adopting automatic scheduling tools to simplify the process, but many employers are still reluctant to use them. Change is hard. However, it is essential for business growth and adaptation. Today, optimizing business operations for efficiency to increase productivity and beat the competition is vital. An automated scheduling system can result in a productivity boost as it frees up a lot of time for HR managers to focus on other activities related to operations management and employee engagement. This article will explore the importance and benefits of automatic scheduling for a company. But, before we discuss the benefits of automated scheduling for a business, it is helpful to understand manual scheduling and where it is lacking. Table of Contents What is manual scheduling? What is automated scheduling? 4 benefits of automated scheduling 1. Saves time 2. Reduces overtime spending 3. Track working employees easily 4. More accurate Why is automatic scheduling better than manual scheduling? How can Truein help you with automated scheduling? Conclusion What is manual scheduling? Manual scheduling is when supervisors and managers have to manage the schedule of workers through timesheets. It is a prevalent practice at most manufacturing and construction companies. As manual scheduling gives the managers complete control over who, when, and where an employee is scheduled, it allows for micromanaging almost all aspects of an employee’s work shift. However, this type of schedule is not sustainable as it can take hours or even days depending on the number of employees to be scheduled. Furthermore, manual scheduling creates layers of abstraction that make it challenging to identify favoritism by managers. For instance, as managers ultimately control the shift schedule, they can easily allot preferred shifts to some employees irrespective of whether the assignment fits them. They can also discriminate between the distribution of hours of work, days off, shift rotations , and holidays. With an automatic employee schedule, the entire shift schedule data can be centralized such that no one manager is in control. What is automated scheduling? Automatic scheduling can have a revolutionary effect on employee scheduling and management. Most automatic schedule maker tools consider your organization’s policies, holidays, weekly off, and staff availability to come up with the best times and people to schedule shifts. The real benefit of an automatic employee schedule lies in its ability to assist HR managers in creating transparent shifts and eliminate favoritism or discrimination. Automated scheduling allows you to put labor where labor is needed with extreme efficiency without overworking employees. An automatic shift schedule is beneficial not only for the company but for employees as well. These systems are flexible and can help improve employee quality of life issues. These tools can allow multiple shift availabilities so employees can work without burnout . As the workload will be evenly distributed among employees, there will be better work-life balance. For HR managers, such tools provide a high degree of automation. As a manager, you can create and fix a schedule taking a fraction of the time compared to manual scheduling. Also, the program will keep you on track even if you are on leave for a day or two. 4 benefits of automated scheduling With automatic scheduling, you can achieve an extremely balanced work schedule for workers and create an automated system that can operate independently. An automatic schedule maker offers more than time-saving and labor management . Here are some essential benefits of automated scheduling. 1. Saves time When HR managers don’t have to sit through a long list of data to find the right employees for a particular shift, they can create a work schedule much more efficiently. Time-saving is one of the most significant benefits of adopting automatic scheduling in your company. The time thus saved by using shift scheduling tools like Truein can then be focused on more critical tasks like promoting your business and making future goals. 2. Reduces overtime spending Overtime spending can have a dramatic impact on a business’s bottom line. If not kept under check, you can lose a substantial portion of your revenue in paying overtime wages. You can configure the system with an auto-scheduler to consider certain overtime limits. It is how you can control overtime spending and eliminate any malpractices, such as unnecessary work hours and frequent overtime shifts. 3. Track working employees easily Often there is a discrepancy between planned or scheduled tasks and actual tasks performed by the employees when there is no way to track their performance. It happens with on-site employees more often. With automated scheduling, it is possible to create an accurate log of exactly what work is being performed and when. An automatic shift scheduler can record the time worked by the employees at the location. This allows HR managers to match the schedule with actuals, tracking down any discrepancy or deviation in employee performance. Managers can quickly generate reports comparing the program with actual tasks and tracking discrepancies or deviations. 4. More accurate Unsurprisingly, an auto-schedule maker is much more accurate than manual scheduling. Human error is possible when you keep timesheets to track employees and create schedules. Automatic scheduling can auto-track data such as employee availability, schedule shift timing, weekly off, etc., to more accurately schedule shifts, ensuring that the right person is available for the job at the right time. It saves time and cost otherwise wasted if shifts are not correctly scheduled. It can lead to poor productivity and loss of revenue. Also, faulty schedules can put the same workers to work affecting their performance and health. Why is automatic scheduling better than manual scheduling? Automatic scheduling saves the labor wasted on manual scheduling to a great extent as managers can invest the resources saved by adopting automated scheduling on the tasks that can increase sales, improve customer interaction, and result in cost savings. Manual scheduling is highly limited in flexibility when a large workforce is involved. With an automated schedule maker, a large workforce can be much more easily managed, ensuring better labor distribution, lower cost, happier employees, and better customer experience. How can Truein help you with automated scheduling? Truein is a cloud-based shift scheduling and attendance software. It is an AI-powered face recognition attendance software that offers capabilities to automate attendance management and leave management. As a shift scheduler, Truein offers HR managers to create successful schedule templates that can be used repeatedly. It simplifies and streamlines the entire scheduling process from tracking employee attendance, geo-locating their position, and monitoring the leave management data.

The numerous benefits of automated scheduling for your business outweigh the reluctance to be open to change. We hope that this guide will help you understand the genuinely transformational benefits in terms of cost savings and better scheduling and auto-scheduler can offer for your business.

How does an Online Attendance System Work? July 24, 2024 An attendance system is one of the critical requirements to ensure the company’s productivity is optimized. While it is hard for many managers to directly co-relate attendance with productivity and revenue, it is an integral part of payroll management. Digital optimization is at the forefront in 2022, and companies across industries are adopting online attendance. Technology has always been the mediator between increased productivity and workforce satisfaction. With an online attendance system, your company can automate an essential workforce and payroll management segment. If you have ever been a manager or supervisor, you understand how tedious and time-consuming manual attendance recording can be. In the digital landscape, there is no place for redundant manual labor. Any company, irrespective of its business nature and size, can benefit from adopting an online attendance app for employee . In this comprehensive guide, we look in-depth at how the technology behind an online attendance tracker functions and why companies need to adopt such a solution. Table of Contents How does an online attendance management system work? Types of online attendance systems Benefits of online attendance system Which industries can benefit from an online attendance system? 1. Manufacturing & construction 2. Facility management 3. Education 4. Healthcare industry Truein: A modern online attendance and time management system Conclusion How does an online attendance management system work? An online attendance system is a dedicated software designed to manage attendance but also offers a robust set of tools for workforce management. A typical online attendance app like Truein is based on cloud architecture with a centralized database with fail-over and backup of infrastructure done across multiple regions. Managers, supervisors, and employees can access the data stored within the online attendance system with a varying degree of access defined by the organization. Since online attendance is entirely paperless, HR managers get freedom from managing timesheets, manually calculating leaves and holidays, accurately converting overtime hours, etc. The time saved can be invested in essential business activities to boost productivity and revenue. The working of an online attendance system is pretty straightforward, which is why companies across industries are openly adopting them. No infrastructural changes or system upgrades are required to implement online attendance within an organization. As mentioned before, it operates on the cloud; everything related to online time attendance exists on cloud servers. To set up an online attendance system, managers have to enter the details of the employee and allow access. Depending on the method you are using, verification of the employee might be required. For instance, an online biometric attendance system uses physical traits like fingerprints, iris scans, thumb impressions, face recognition, etc., to identify workers and record attendance. One of the most significant advantages of adopting an online attendance system is the easy data availability from anywhere, anytime. Managers can access attendance data for payroll with a click. Similarly, supervisors can check the availability of workers without any interference from the managers. An online attendance app allows employees to access shift data, record attendance, and get notified about schedule changes. Types of online attendance systems There are several types of online attendance systems available. A company can choose an online time attendance solution that best matches its requirements. Card punching machines are the most basic type of online attendance system. These machines use a time card that stores the employee ID and other related information about a person. To record clock in and out time, the workers must swap the time card on a machine. The problem with card punching machines is that they are prone to buddy punching . Online biometric attendance systems are primarily popular. Biometric attendance systems rely on physiological or behavioral characteristics to identify an employee and record attendance. Physiological biometric attendance systems capture and compare a person’s fingerprints, hands, face, iris, etc. At the same time, behavioral biometric attendance systems rely on a person’s behavior, such as voice, keystroke, and signature. Mechanized attendance systems record online attendance when input is provided. Such attendance systems depend on passwords to automatically register in and out the timing of the employees. These systems offer a degree of automation but are highly prone to time theft . Cloud-based attendance systems are the latest inclusion in the category. Truein is one of the leading cloud-based AI-powered time and attendance management systems that utilize modern cloud infrastructure and captures attendance by using face recognition technology. The benefit of implementing such systems is decentralization. Cloud-based attendance systems like Truein don’t require any additional hardware and can be used through mobile apps. While evaluating the necessity of online attendance within your organization, you must look beyond the upfront costs and anticipate the benefits. In detail, let’s discuss some of the essential benefits of an online attendance app. Benefits of online attendance system Prevents error: Online attendance systems eliminate human error vulnerability. Often staff complaints about incorrect data from the HR team result in inaccurate attendance calculations and ultimately affect salary. With online attendance management, such errors can be easily prevented. More efficient: Manual attendance keeping is cumbersome because it involves manually recording attendance in timesheets. As managers have to maintain these timesheets and manually input data into payroll software periodically, it’s not difficult to anticipate how time-consuming this entire process can be. Online attendance systems entirely automate the timekeeping of employees. Modern online attendance apps like Truein can be easily integrated with payroll software. It eliminates the requirement to manually share data between attendance and payroll software. Real-time tracking is possible: A unique feature of some online attendance systems is that they allow real-time monitoring of employees. In industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing, where the workforce is scattered over a large area, real-time attendance tracking effectively discourages time theft and calculates working hours more accurately. Automatic reports generation: The comprehensive set of tools we spoke of earlier includes automatic reports generation. Automated attendance and time management systems like Truein have built-in capability to generate insightful reports. The data in these reports can facilitate a company’s productivity and workforce management decisions. Integrate with other software: Plug and play feature of online attendance apps make them more robust. The cloud infrastructure of online attendance systems enables compatibility with HRM, accounting, marketing, and payroll software. It is incredible freedom from migrating data from one software to another, which is a technical task and often requires the services of a third-party engineering team. No additional peripherals are required, accessible from the phone: Cloud-based software is also known as a mobile-based attendance system or hardware-less application. It is called hardware less because it does not require the setup or installation of any peripherals. These apps can be deployed on the workers’ smartphones or you can use it as a kiosk and require an initial configuration to record real-time attendance. Which industries can benefit from an online attendance system? 1. Manufacturing & construction These industries do not have a workforce tied to a desktop computer at one location. Workers in the manufacturing and construction industries are pleased with several remote areas. With online attendance systems, workers in these industries can be tracked, and their attendance can be accurately recorded. Furthermore, the geofencing attendance system ensures that workers are at the worksite while recording their attendance. 2. Facility management Managing employee time and attendance for facility management staff can be challenging since most managers are always on the go, traveling from one location to another to serve customers. With online real-time attendance management systems, facility managers can remotely track employees. They can also access essential employee data such as time, location, number of workers, etc. 3. Education Attendance is an integral part of the education industry. Unsurprisingly, schools and colleges are one of the main customers of online attendance system manufacturers. In the wake of the pandemic outbreak, more educational institutions are proactively adopting touchless online attendance systems. 4. Healthcare industry In the healthcare industry, HR teams are usually busy with medical practices and keeping up with insurance, billing, and compliance. Amidst all these responsibilities, employee time tracking can be a significant productivity hassle. This is why the healthcare industry is one of the prime customers of cloud-based timekeeping solutions. Truein: A modern online attendance and time management system Truein is a full-fledged online attendance and time management system that helps companies automate attendance keeping. An AI-based face recognition attendance system , Truein offers HR managers complete control over employee time tracking.

How To Create Attendance Policy for Your Manufacturing Plant? July 24, 2024 The manufacturing industry is one of the major contributors to the United States economy. with a total value of $2269.2 to U.S. GDP, which makes up 10.8 % of total GDP . Also, the manufacturing industry is one of the largest employers of the labor force in the world. However, its reliance on workers puts it at risk of productivity issues such as absenteeism . Absenteeism results in a loss of over $225.8 billion to the U.S. manufacturing industry annually. Workers can be blamed for frequent absences from work, hampering productivity and scheduling within a company, but the attendance policy can also be a contributing factor. Effective working in any manufacturing organization depends on the employers’ punctuality, sincerity, and schedule. In this regard, employee attendance becomes crucial because it is required to ensure regular work. Employees are confused or misinformed in the absence of proper attendance policies at work, which leads to absenteeism. In this article, we explore in detail how your manufacturing organization should create an effective attendance policy. Table of Contents Why is it essential to have an attendance policy at your manufacturing plant? 1. Helps to reduce absenteeism 2. Increase productivity of employees, which helps in revenue growth How to create the best attendance policy for manufacturing? 1. Learn about labor laws 2. Create a point-based attendance policy 3. Communicate with your employees and explain the policy clearly Manufacturing Attendance Policy Template Free attendance policy template for manufacturing How can Truein help with attendance in the manufacturing industry? Why is it essential to have an attendance policy at your manufacturing plant? 1. Helps to reduce absenteeism Excessive absenteeism can deeply impact the bottom line of any manufacturing company. If workers often report late or don’t attend shifts at all, managers might have to restructure workflows and schedules. But this can have a domino effect on the entire organization. When you have a manufacturing attendance policy, employees know what is expected at work. It also helps maintain a balance between employees as coworkers are not forced to take over extra workload because of the absentees. 2. Increase productivity of employees, which helps in revenue growth When workers don’t have to rush into things or their working hours are not increased due to a lack of workforce, the quality of their work is high. An attendance policy at work positively affects overall productivity. When workers are regularly at work, they adapt to the changes in the work schedules or environment, ultimately improving their efficiency. Regular attendance ensures that appropriate numbers of workers are available to work in shifts. Hence, no delay in production can affect the end customers. Uninterrupted production at a manufacturing company helps ensure that the revenue keeps on growing. How to create the best attendance policy for manufacturing? Before you create a manufacturing plant attendance policy, it is essential to consider mandatory requirements. First, you must be aware that the attendance policy at your manufacturing company has to be flexible. As the requirements of the company or the workers will change, the attendance policy document must change too. It must be adjusted over time to adapt to the business challenges and to accommodate the requirements of employees. The best attendance policy for manufacturing is the one that’s amended annually or quarterly based on workers’ attendance data. Here are some important considerations to keep in mind. 1. Learn about labor laws All manufacturing attendance policies must comply with federal, state, and local laws. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) works at the federal level, giving workers the right to 12 workweeks of job-protected unpaid leave for medical reasons. You have to mention in your attendance policy that FMLA leaves will not result in any disciplinary action or termination. You can use a labor attendance app for smooth attendance tracking. If your manufacturing unit also employs workers with disabilities, the attendance policy must adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) rules. It requires you to change your attendance policy to accommodate workers that live with disabilities. Like FMLA, you cannot fire or take disciplinary action against workers for situations covered by the ADA. As state and local employment laws vary, you must consult local consultancies about these policies. 2. Create a point-based attendance policy A popular system of enforcing attendance policies for manufacturing is the point system. It’s a simple model where each event is related to attendance, such as absence, tardiness, and too-long breaks corresponding to certain points. The points are decided based on the severity of the lapse in attendance. A typical point-based attendance policy for a manufacturing company looks like this: Issue Definition Points Tardiness Less than ten minutes late 0.5 Late Between ten minutes and two hours late 1 Partial shift Leaving work early 1.5 Truant Over two hours late 2 Absent Absent with a phone call 2.5 No-call, no-show Absent without a phone call 10 For instance, if a worker is late for more than an hour, his record will have 1 point and so on. These points will be added at the end of each month, quarter, or year to enforce disciplinary actions. Usually, the following actions are taken as per the end score: Disciplinary Action Points Verbal warning 5 Written warning 7 Personal improvement plan 10 Termination 12 The point system is an efficient way to inform workers of the consequences and disincentivize absenteeism. You can include particular issues for your manufacturing company or adjust the points. For example, if the workers are often showing delay, you can allot more points to discourage such behavior. 3. Communicate with your employees and explain the policy clearly Just putting up an attendance policy will not deliver the benefits you are looking for. It would help if you communicated the attendance expectations with the workers. The language of the attendance policy must be comprehensible to the workforce. Explain and include definitions of absenteeism, job abandonment, excused absences, unexcused absences, unpaid absences, and attendance policy exceptions. Manufacturing Attendance Policy Template We created this sample attendance policy for manufacturing companies to manage the workforce better. Disclaimer: While we put in our best efforts to create this sample attendance policy for a manufacturing company, it is not a standard template. This attendance policy template is supposed to be a reference document.

For example, manufacturing, logistics, and construction are some sectors where facilities management is a significant component of the overall organizational management. Unsurprisingly, these are the sectors that frequently face facility management problems. Suppose your business is struggling with the commonly encountered issues. In that case, the problem might be that you cannot effectively appreciate and include facility management as one of your core business functions. Another reason can be incompetent management or a limited budget. Here we elaborate on the most common issues that result in facility management problems. We will also explore the solution to fix these issues. Let’s get started. Table of Contents 1. The increased cost of unplanned periodic expenses on maintenance 2. Multitasking and coordinating teams 3. Poor time management due to lack of real-time data 4. Maintenance of old equipment and facilities 5. Struggle managing technicians Conclusion 1. The increased cost of unplanned periodic expenses on maintenance Poor facility management can escalate the need for unplanned periodic maintenance, a considerable cost to the operating budget. Often the facility management cost does not factor in the building maintenance as it is prepared during the construction phase. It leaves facilities susceptible to frequent damage. Weather, wear and tear, excessive use, etc., affect the infrastructure within a facility, and the inability to routinely conduct checkups for any maintenance requirements can result in faults enforcing unplanned maintenance. It directly translates into increased operating costs. The fix Businesses must hire professional facility managers aware of the building maintenance requirements. Such managers have the technical know-how to deploy measures that facilitate the smooth functioning of operations within the facility by keeping a check on buildings and other utilities. It is essential to hire professional facility managers as they can perform tests on the efficiency and durability of the building equipment to ensure productivity or operations are never stalled. 2. Multitasking and coordinating teams Communication is essential to ensure facilities run smoothly. Still, one of the most commonly reported facilities management issues is that multitasking and coordinating teams are hectic and unmanageable. Such issues are common at facilities where teams still rely on manual methods to report failures and document other operational tasks. The fix It is relatively more straightforward to fix this facility management problem. For the constant flow of communication to streamline the organization, innovation, knowledge sharing, and productivity, you need to choose a centralized cloud-based facility management software. Such tools allow you to automate failure reporting and inventory management and generate automatized reports. It makes facility management incredibly simpler. Most facility managers are overwhelmed with handling all the tasks, so you need facility management software to allow them to be at the top of things. One example to facilitate multitasking and team coordination is implementing digital calendars to let workers and managers know their maintenance responsibilities and plan the workload accordingly. Another example is a labor attendance app used to manage attendance effectively. 3. Poor time management due to lack of real-time data Facility management is highly dynamic, and managers have to micromanage several daily processes, like coordinating teams, attending urgent communications, participating in meetings, consulting vendors, supporting customers, and much more. In most scenarios, these processes require managing workers within the facility. In the absence of real-time data, many facilities management issues arise. You cannot immediately decide on tasks when you don’t know where an employee is or how the shift is scheduled. You cannot plan or prioritize tasks. The fix For better facility management use of automated employee tracking software is beneficial. Truein is a time and attendance software backed with geofencing attendance system . It provides complete workforce attendance and shift management. Facility managers can ensure that employees are at the destined location during shifts. It also generates auto reports regarding overtime, absenteeism, leaves, and shift schedule efficiency, improving facility management services. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 4. Maintenance of old equipment and facilities Wear and tear of the facility building and equipment is inevitable. While you might have to replace the components of the facilities at some point, proper measures to maintain and prevent any damage to old gear and facilities can help prevent any severe damage. Poor maintenance of equipment results in facilities management issues that require a large budget to restore the facility’s state. Without planned maintenance, facilities can fall into a state of disrepair and lead to a poor standard for habitation. The fix As building structures and equipment become old and technical problems become frequent, facility managers need to plan ways to extend the life of existing assets following the allotted budget available for maintenance. Prevention, timely repair, and replacement of faulty components will ensure that maintenance costs are always within the proposed budget and that funds are always available for emergency repairs and replacements. Here again, facility management software tools can be utilized to evaluate and forecast the maintenance budget, accounting for worn-out equipment and buildings. 5. Struggle managing technicians Apart from facility managers, technicians are essential to keep things running smoothly. However, they can be a bit much to handle. A poorly managed facility makes tracking the technician’s performance and professionalism difficult. You will never know if a fault or accident occurred due to the poor state of facility equipment or improper technical repair. It puts a lot on facility owners, driving up the operation cost and making it difficult to sustain the business and deliver quality customer service. The fix You can also explore options to increase the budget to allow the right tools. If you face challenges with dishonest technicians, you can outsource the facility management. facility managers quickly identify incompetent technicians. This will ensure that you have the best facility management staff focusing on core business activities such that you get continuously high returns from facility management services. Conclusion The above-listed facility management problems occur in every organization. The solution to these problems is to approach facility management from a facility manager-centric perspective. Technology can quickly fix most facilities management issues by empowering employees to manage problems as they emerge. An integrated facility management software can aid your decision-making. Truein is one such app to easily manage workers within a facility through centralized control, real-time tracking, geofencing, and GPS tracking.

What Is Shift Swap Policy and How To Create It For Your Organization? July 24, 2024 In any business, your employees can ask for swap shifts and it is not an uncommon occurrence. Still, this seemingly routine procedure can become the bottleneck in workforce management without the right system. Suppose you expect employee A to show up on Monday for the morning shift, but he swaps shifts with employee B without your knowledge. While employee B shows up on Monday morning, he’s unfamiliar with the opening procedure and doesn’t bother to ask. This will cause a delay in business operation. This is one scenario, but there can be several such incidents where employees swapping shifts can result in management and productivity issues. It is why you must have a shift swap policy at work. Read on to find out how to establish effective shift swapping at work. Table of Contents What is a shift swapping policy? How does the shift swap policy work? Benefits of shift swapping policy 1. Employees get flexibility 2. Less no show at work 3. No extra work for managers What to include in a shift swapping policy 1. Define a clear process 2. When staff will receive the shifts 3. How much time will you give employees for upcoming schedules? 4. Shift swap approval process 5. Disciplinary procedures for failing to comply with the policy Conclusion What is a shift swapping policy? A shift swapping policy is a documented set of rules and procedures that a company uses to guide and manage the trade of employee shifts. A swapping shift at work policy aims to ensure that guidelines are followed per the strict set of protocols to avoid scheduling mistakes. You would want to have a shift swap policy at work for several reasons. Without proper procedures in place, employees are more likely to make decisions on their own, resulting in several drawbacks like – understaffing, additional labor costs, employee burnout, and conflict between employees. Your organization can benefit by removing any confusion from happening and keeping payroll and management duties streamlined. As an HR manager, you must outline a well-defined shift swap policy to ensure that there is not too much flexibility that could result in cutting corners. How does the shift swap policy work? In practice, an effective shift swap policy gives a structure for employees to follow when they want to swap shifts with a co-worker. Most organizations implement a digital system for workers to solicit and respond to shift swap requests. If the workforce size is significant, then the shift swap policy can have several limitations on who can swap with who. For example, employees can be restricted from swap shifts with someone outside their department or work area. Employees who want to change shifts will ‘advertise’ their intention for the same on the system so that other workers can see it. The workers can detail the shifts they want to work in return so other employees who are willing to swap can accept the request. Once there is an agreement between the workers, the request is forwarded to managers or supervisors for approval. Benefits of shift swapping policy 1. Employees get flexibility The unpredictability of life makes it impossible to be fully prepared. No matter how perfect your shift scheduling is, there’s always the possibility that unforeseen circumstances might affect the availability of workers. When you have a shift swap policy, employees can attend to unforeseen circumstances forcing them to leave early, take leave, work remotely, or arrange shift swaps. The ability to change work schedules provides much-required flexibility to employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance. It also encourages them to be loyal to the company as they have the option to handle important life events without losing their pay. You have a happy and engaged workforce when you give your employees the freedom to swap shifts and a flexible schedule. 2. Less no show at work Most employees cannot work unannounced because they get stuck with personal emergencies. When you give them the flexibility of swapping shifts and laid out policies, they know how to arrange for a substitute for the shifts they cannot attend. This significantly reduces the time employees are a ‘no show’ at work. It is a boost for productivity and contributes to the overall revenue growth of the company. 3. No extra work for managers As we explained how the shift swapping policy is implemented in practice, HR managers and supervisors have little involvement. Adopting an automated system to handle the changes in the shift roster only requires the manager to approve or reject the shift. Also, a shift swap policy ensures fewer shift changes with tighter coverage. With shift swapping tools, you can quickly identify suitable employees who are skilled, cost-efficient, and available so you can easily cover the shift requirements. Also, a clearly defined shift swap policy streamlines the process that reduces shift-swap frustration. It also minimizes miscommunication among the managers and staff. All this results in effective shift scheduling and can bring significant financial savings by lowering extra labor or overtime costs. What to include in a shift swapping policy In theory, shift swapping might seem simple, but it can turn into a nightmare quickly. When you work hard on creating an effective work schedule, impromptu tampering by workers, later on, can wreak havoc. With an effective shift swap policy, you are less frustrated and have more streamlined workers who are least likely to disturb the shift schedules unexpectedly. Here’s how you can create an effective swapping shift at work policy. 1. Define a clear process The correct procedure for swapping schedules must start at the managerial level. Managers must create transparent, fair, and accessible rules for everyone. A good shift swap policy clearly defines the company’s and employees’ responsibilities. It must address the following key things: 2. When staff will receive the shifts Shift swap is often the result of unexpected personal issues such as a child falling ill, school events popping up, or other workers asking for a shift trade. However, not being aware of their shift details in advance can be frustrating for workers. As a manager, it is your responsibility to provide them with clarity on who is working and when. It is how you can plan effectively and approve any shift swaps. Truein is a shift scheduling software and a time and attendance management app. Managers can create shift schedules and share them with the workers instantly. Workers can also mark their availability or absence Within the Truein workers attendance app on their smartphones. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 3. How much time will you give employees for upcoming schedules? One important inclusion must be the timeline for shift swaps. Train employees that they cannot ask for trading shifts too close to their scheduled shifts. It can disrupt the entire schedule due to the domino effect. Depending upon the business nature, you can set rules on how much time employees have to ask for a shift swap. For instance, 5 hours can be allowed as it is enough time for any other worker to respond to work as a tradeoff. 4. Shift swap approval process A formalized shift swap policy is essential to prevent any adverse consequences resulting from shift swapping at work, such as extra labor costs, worker no-shows, and unskilled workers added to the shift. With automatic scheduling software , such nuances of shift swap can be easily managed. To mitigate such risks, you must: Give supervisors and managers the veto power to review and approve shift swap requests from workers. Set timelines that prevent employees from requesting shift swaps too close to their scheduled shifts. Enforce workplace rules, training requirements, or permitted hours for a valid shift swap request. Allow shift swapping only between qualified employees within the same department or roles. 5. Disciplinary procedures for failing to comply with the policy It is essential to communicate with the workers what the company’s expectations are from them. Unless they know them, there is no way to fulfill these expectations. They must be aware of the disciplinary actions that can be taken in case they fail to comply with the shift-swapping policies. You must train employees and onboard them through a formal process to familiarize them with the swap shift process. Enforcing disciplinary action must be the last resort. Still, keeping employees in line with the shift swap policies is a continuous challenge; don’t be uncomfortable while enforcing the rules. Furthermore, you must ensure that all the disciplinary actions comply with federal, state, and local employment and labor laws. Conclusion Shift swaps are not only great for employee schedule flexibility, but they can be an excellent asset for any organization facing potentially understaffed shifts. This is a seasonal trend for most businesses when customer demand is high. Maintain a comprehensive shift swap work policy that reminds employees that swapping is allowed and recommended. It saves you from no calls and no-shows from employees. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors? Jul 24, 2024 How to Start an HVAC Business?

These professionals are responsible for maintaining equipment, developing skilled staff, optimizing operations, and facilitating business growth. According to the International Facility Management Association (IFMA) , a qualified facility manager must be able to successfully optimize facility management operations and “ensure functionality, comfort, safety, and efficiency of the built environment by integrating people, place, process, and technology.” If you are planning a career as a facility manager, then there are some essential skills that you should focus on. In this article, we describe crucial facility manager skills that are essential for a successful career. Table of Contents Six essential facility manager skills 1. Communication 2. Team management 3. Create and manage the facility management budget 4. Time management and scheduling shifts for employees 5. Project management 6. Technology skills Three tips to improve your skills as a facility manager 1. Talk to your staff and know their problems 2. Provide goals and feedback to employees 3. Track productivity and check employees are working properly Conclusion Six essential facility manager skills 1. Communication Not just facility managers but any leadership role requires good communication skills. Whether written or oral, facility managers should be able to present ideas or communicate any other information in an engaging and motivating way. Facility managers often look after the workforce within the facility and must communicate with vendors, suppliers, and customers. This is why one of the critical skills for facilities managers is to communicate effectively. As a facility manager, you will delegate responsibilities, guide employees, explain ideas, suggest changes, and support customers. All these responsibilities require you to communicate transparently with stakeholders. 2. Team management Leading staff members is one of the primary facility manager skills and responsibilities. Any facility will have several workers across different departments, such as maintenance, cleaning crews, security teams, and logistic. Facilities managers must be able to manage and navigate individual employees at all levels. They must also be able to design weekly schedules , delegate jobs, and tasks, and make them perform as a team. You will often be confronted with situations where you must promote unity, resolve conflicts, and mediate issues between staff members. Without proper team management skills, you cannot deliver efficiently on these requirements. 3. Create and manage the facility management budget Facility management operation is greatly dependent on numbers. Essentially it involves inventory management, the number of hours workers work, operational cost, and budget forecasting. The basic foundation in financial math is another skill required from a facility manager. A responsible facilities manager must be able to create monthly, quarterly, and annual budgets. Operating a facility is an expensive affair. There are a lot of machines, extensive electrical systems, and equipment. Facility managers must be aware of the lifespan of appliances and equipment to create an achievable budget for maintenance or replacement. Budgeting is not only for forecasting, but it is also crucial for guiding appropriate staffing decisions that affect the overall facility management. As a facility manager, you must purchase software and other automation systems that meet the standards set by superiors. As one of your core responsibilities, you will complete budgetary assessments, create financial reports, and submit the facility management budget forecast to the management for review. 4. Time management and scheduling shifts for employees Facilities managers are solely responsible for maintaining a functional unit. It is their responsibility to manage projects and lead multiple teams. This is why time management is one of the critical facility manager skills needed to ensure that projects are completed on time and the workforce is appropriately trained. To ensure smooth functioning, facility managers must maintain records of the infrastructure, facility management operations, machines, and maintenance. Additionally, as part of staff management, they have to work on schedules and create staff shifts according to workload. Most facilities use software like Truein, a total employee time and attendance management system for time management and shift scheduling. An AI-based face recognition attendance system , Truein offers location-based attendance . Facility managers can use this software to track employees and ensure they are at their designated location within the facility. As facilities managers are also tasked with reviewing and assessing each worker’s performance and progress, they can use Truein to calculate overtime , absenteeism, leaves, and other employee attendance and scheduling reports. 5. Project management Project management falls within the scope of facility manager skills and responsibilities. Facility managers must follow the functional organizational structure to deliver on the project quality as the senior executives define. With project-based organizational structures, teams are given a degree of autonomy to manage projects as they see fit. Therefore, facility managers should have project management skills to deliver revenue and budget goals. If you are a proficient project manager, you can quickly move up the career ladder as the project requirements become more complex. 6. Technology skills By the nature of work, facility managers face dozens of daily challenges. Many of these challenges demand creative technological solutions. Fortunately, with the influx of so many new technical solutions, it is possible to automate many aspects of facility management operations. Counted among critical skills for facility managers, technological creativity is essential to build an innovative workplace. If you are not technologically proficient as a facility manager, you risk falling behind on many important tools. According to industry observers, facilities managers should focus on three critical aspects of technology to be successful. They must keep an open mind about new opportunities becoming possible due to technological advancements in service management, delivery, and reporting. Facilities management is a people business, so technology making it easier to manage people should be integrated into this service. For example, cloud-based technologies offer greater flexibility in managing the workforce due to their decentralized architecture. The facility manager should find a solution that keeps people and assets safe. Some technologies include IoT sensors that can detect faulty equipment, employee tracking software, and logistics management software. If you have these crucial facility manager skills, then you are ready to take up the challenge. However, if you think you need to improve your skills further, here are some tips. Three tips to improve your skills as a facility manager 1. Talk to your staff and know their problems Facilities managers should constantly communicate with their staff to know their needs and requirements. When you build a relationship with your staff, you can create a respectful work environment. You can use anonymous forms and other feedback tools to encourage employees to share their feelings regarding the work environment, duties, and culture. You are responsible for taking honest feedback and using the information to design work policies that provide satisfaction to workers. 2. Provide goals and feedback to employees Employee training and encouragement are required to motivate the workforce. You must provide each worker with appropriate assignments and achievable goals to help them improve in their role. As a facility manager, you must be aware of the skill sets of your workers so you can task them with duties managing their skills. Sharing honest feedback is also your responsibility once employees have submitted their work. Provide constructive feedback on the areas of improvement, and don’t forget to complement quality work. Goals and feedback are essential for workers as they take them as an indicator to develop skills and perform their duty better. 3. Track productivity and check employees are working properly You won’t be able to ensure optimal functioning and operations of the facilities until you track your employees’ productivity. Evaluating productivity is how you can track each employee and help them improve their skills. Facility managers can sometimes have to guide huge teams. To keep track of the productivity of such enormous groups, you need software like Truein. Such tools can help you closely monitor the performance and productivity of employees, helping facility managers identify the staff’s training needs. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion While a facility manager must have all the required leadership and managerial skills, the above-mentioned ones are crucial.

How To Reduce Absenteeism In Manufacturing Industry? July 25, 2024 The 2020 pandemic and the resulting high absenteeism made the manufacturing sector one of the most affected industries by employee absences in 2021 . But, absenteeism in the manufacturing industry existed long before COVID struck. While the problem isn’t new, it has become more severe. This has prompted organizations to look for concrete measures to curb the issue. This article discusses how to reduce absenteeism in the manufacturing industry through proper employee management and engagement. Table of Contents Top 6 tips to address absenteeism in the manufacturing industry 1. Creating an attendance policy and talking about unplanned absences in it 2. Focus on what your employee needs and their wellness 3. Incentivize employees with good attendance 4. Offer flexible work schedule 5. Engage with your employees 6. Keep track of employee absences Conclusion Top 6 tips to address absenteeism in the manufacturing industry 1. Creating an attendance policy and talking about unplanned absences in it The manufacturing industry has witnessed a shift in the workforce’s attitude toward the work-life balance. As the employee working habits and the industry is changing post-pandemic, our attendance policies must also be updated to accommodate the change. The most common reasons for absenteeism in the manufacturing industry are sickness, burnout, injuries, childcare demands, and the search for a different job. While it is impossible to include all the issues in your attendance policy, management has to ensure that the company maintains a fair, consistent, easy-to-understand, and enforceable policy. Make an attendance policy that complies with state and local labor laws. Also, a point-based attendance policy will clarify how the managers handle such leaves and the consequences of unplanned absences . It provides a tangible way for employees to understand the value of alerting the manager of their absence. 2. Focus on what your employee needs and their wellness It is not surprising that happy employees are most excited about their work. If your company provides for the workers’ physical and mental well-being, you will have a productive workforce. Improved well-being of employees means fewer sick days, absences, and last-minute schedule changes. The challenge is reducing absenteeism in the manufacturing industry and ensuring that your needs and requirements are tended for. You must train the line managers, the first contact on health and well-being issues within their team. They are responsible for the day-to-day decisions that affect the workers. Teaching them to be more emphatic, anticipating the employees, and encouraging open communication will help. 3. Incentivize employees with good attendance Rather than focusing on punishing absentees, organizations should reward good attendance. It is a constructive way to encourage workers to be punctual and sincere with their attendance. There should be a reward program to recognize good work. This will enhance an employee’s sense of ownership and improve their satisfaction. 4. Offer flexible work schedule Adopting a flexible work schedule can help companies bring down the number of absences. Workers now look for a better work-life balance. When you offer flexible schedules, employees have more time to spend with family and friends. It nurtures their emotional and mental well-being. Also, a flexible work schedule increases employee retention, reduces stress, boosts output, and improves workplace productivity. Managers should work on shift schedules to allow workers flexibility for personal reasons such as childcare or sickness. This will reduce unscheduled absences, and employees are more likely to abide by the company’s attendance policy . 5. Engage with your employees Why is absenteeism happening in the first place? Establish a dialogue with employees who are frequently absent. When you understand their motivations, it is easier to find common ground. But it might be difficult as people often are not comfortable discussing their issues directly. Therefore, you can use engagement surveys to allow employees to express their concerns or issues. Let them know their information will be kept confidential to start a healthy dialogue with the workers. The best employee engagement strategy is listening to your workers and considering their expectations when making workplace decisions. 6. Keep track of employee absences No manufacturing company can reduce poor attendance issues without proper attendance management. HR managers need to rein in and strategize how to reduce absenteeism in the manufacturing industry before the problem spirals out of control. Software tools for employee time and attendance tracking can help managers make decisions based on real-time data. Truein is a hardwareless time and attendance management software that provides extensive oversight and control over time off management. It tracks employee attendance in real time and has options to set and share attendance policies. Truein’s mobile time and attendance can be deployed directly on workers’ smartphones to record their attendance and track their location during work hours. As a complete attendance management software, it also offers shift scheduling and overtime calculation and is easily integrated with payroll software. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion To reduce absenteeism in the manufacturing industry, one must maintain a good workplace culture and schedule flexibility. time and attendance systems for manufacturing like Truein are also essential for reducing employee absenteeism .

How To Reduce Your Employee’s Overtime? July 25, 2024 Overtime is a problem for both companies and workers. It often feels like the only option you have to meet productivity demands, but it comes at a high price. Several studies provide clear evidence that overtime is counterproductive. One study found that a 10% increase in overtime can reduce productivity by 2.4% . The little boost you get by burning the ‘midnight oil’ is at the cost of the energy of the workers, which affects their overall work routine. It is not to say that you cannot schedule occasional overtime to meet a deadline. Just if the company has a sustained reliance on expensive employee overtime, it is a reflection of poor management. In this article, we will explore how to reduce employee overtime strategically. We share some tips that can help you deal with overtime. Table of Contents Six tips to reduce employee overtime 1. Take meetings when only required 2. Your employees must have proper tools and training 3. Create an overtime policy 4. Allow flexible work schedules 5. Cap overtime hours 6. Use time-tracking software to track overtime Conclusion Six tips to reduce employee overtime 1. Take meetings when only required Team meetings are helpful but not always the best use of your workers’ time. When sitting in a meeting room, employees often lose a chunk of their time when they have only a few minutes of project updates to share. The rest of their time is spent on their phones. For the blue-collar workforce, it means not calling them for meetings often from the production floor. This wasted time is better utilized in accomplishing real work. Your company should adopt innovative ways to consider project updates instead of meetings. Digital work management and task management tools like Asana and Jira are best for automated communication between employees and management. 2. Your employees must have proper tools and training Reducing overtime is more about maximizing the output of regular employee hours. The rule here is to work smarter, not longer. Surprisingly, an average worker spends more than a quarter of their day just reading and answering emails at work. It is just one example; several similar day-to-day tasks occupy your team’s time. You have to ensure that your workers are performing their duties correctly. Email automation allows you to respond instantly to customer queries instead of mailing them one by one. For employee training and onboarding, you can also use self-paced programs so that workers can learn at their pace and get better at their jobs. For manufacturing and construction industry it requires replacing manual tools with automated devices such as replacing hammers and forging tools with power tools. Most companies do not know how to decrease overtime, and they keep looking for better and more significant ways when small things can add up and reduce overtime. To maximize productivity within the available work hours, you must ensure that your workers have the tools to do the best work. If workers spend their time troubleshooting old equipment, it leads to poor efficiency; so you need to provide them with new tools. 3. Create an overtime policy As a manager, you can quickly moderate the overtime the workers put in by clearly specifying the policies that ensure work-life balance. Some of the most successful companies offer great benefits like flexible work schedules, remote working, and unlimited paid time off to give their employees greater control over where and when they work. In the absence of an overtime policy , employees are not sure what the company’s stance is about overtime. This usually defaults to a workaholic mindset where workers assume that working longer hours with getting them promotions and better compensation. You have to ensure that workers do not develop such a mindset. 4. Allow flexible work schedules In a post-pandemic era, it is clear that work-life balance is most important for workers. Flexible work schedules allow employees to attend to critical personal duties like kids, aged parents, or illness. Flexibility in work schedules will enable them to take care of their responsibilities without taking offs or working overtime. 5. Cap overtime hours There are no federal limitations on how much overtime a worker can work. While there is no legal framework, employers are within their rights to cap overtime hours. Overtime might be inevitable, but it doesn’t have to stress the labor costs to the extent that it starts eating up profits. A comprehensive overtime policy can determine the workers’ week, month, and even annual overtime hours. You can keep the policy flexible to have room for extra hours in case an employee is required to work more overtime. Capping overtime is the best way to ensure that work gets distributed more evenly amongst the workers so everyone can work overtime hours. 6. Use time-tracking software to track overtime Once you have a constructive overtime policy, you can use time and attendance software like Truein to ensure all policy guidelines are followed. Truein is a cloud-based attendance software that also features automatic overtime calculation. It is a hardwareless software that can be deployed directly on smartphones to start recording attendance and overtime. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion Overtime management is essential to reduce labor costs.

Facilities management must be sustainable through energy conservation, waste management, planned maintenance, and more. Still, many business owners fail to understand that sustainable success and growth cannot be achieved without effectively planning facility management. Table of Contents What is facility management? Six ways to improve facility management operations 1. Automate facility management activities by using facility management software 2. Implement a preventive maintenance plan to make it easier to forecast when a repair is required 3. Centralize all the facility management operations 4. Engage with their employees across all departments and know about the issues 5. Upgrade your equipment 6. Track employee attendance properly Conclusion What is facility management? Facility management is a professional discipline that involves efficient and sustainable delivery of services and facility improvements to ensure uninterrupted productivity. Here are the top tips for driving long-term facility management success that we have learned after interviewing 20+ experienced facility managers. Six ways to improve facility management operations 1. Automate facility management activities by using facility management software How can you streamline facility management and reduce operational costs? It’s a common question asked to facility managers. The solution is data that can be used to analyze and forecast various facility management processes. An investment in an integrated workplace management software system that can automate facility management activities can help you create a well-orchestrated workplace in your facilities. These systems offer numerous features and resources that facility managers can use to get deeper insights. This data can help them make decisions that can drive beneficial changes. When you can automate most facility management services such as vendor management, in-house service tracking, availability to track work orders, automatically invoice vendors, and advance notify workers about upcoming maintenance of service requirements, you can manage facility service much more efficiently. A software system does much more than one person can ever do – streamline facilities management services. 2. Implement a preventive maintenance plan to make it easier to forecast when a repair is required Facility managers must be able to operate services at optimum efficiency. For this, assets must be managed carefully with a preventive maintenance plan. Experienced facility managers understand how with preventative maintenance, the life of the assets can be extended, infrastructure can be maintained, and downtime can be reduced to a bare minimum. Key performance indicators or KPI analytics data can help you make data-driven decisions for constructing a preventive maintenance plan. Some facility managers find maintaining and tracking necessary performance indicators for preventive maintenance plans overwhelming. It often happens when there is no software maintenance to help you collect and analyze data. Again, the importance of an integrated facility management software system is highlighted here. When you can manage and track as much information about equipment within the facility, you can forecast preventive maintenance better. Facility management software records all important equipment details such as manufacturer, serial number, emergency repairs, warranty information, and recommended checkups. It is beneficial because you are no longer susceptible to reactive maintenance as you proactively fix faulty equipment or wear and tear before it halts operations at facilities. 3. Centralize all the facility management operations Decentralization can be a significant hurdle in facility management. When facility managers do not have access to all the information regarding the operation process, there are more likely to make mistakes. This is why centralizing all the facility management operations using the software is how you can improve facility management. There are several benefits of centralized federal facility management operations. You get real-time data on repair and maintenance management, easily track parts and supplies, inform settlement and payment processing, perform asset management more efficiently, and provide faster support to contractors, vendors, and customers. You can open a new frontier for futuristic facility management services by correctly leveraging the facility management software. Digitalization of businesses is mandatory today. If you want to stay relevant and beat the competition, you have to initiate data-driven decisions. Centralization of the facility management operation is how you can achieve that. 4. Engage with their employees across all departments and know about the issues To improve facility management operations, facility managers must collaborate with other stakeholders. Engaging employees from technical teams, janitorial crews, packers and movers, waste haulers, and others will help you manage operations and eliminate miscommunication. Building relationships with these key stakeholders and encouraging feedback can help reduce facilities’ environmental footprints, increase recycling rates, and ensure operations run smoothly. When facility managers can encourage and engage with employees across several departments, they create a sustainable and positive environment. Employees feel encouraged to take accountability for their roles and perform at their best. 5. Upgrade your equipment A core responsibility of facility managers is to ensure that building assets and equipment remain updated at all times. You must keep an eye on the newest technologies that can help optimize facility management operations and cut costs. For example, for most facility buildings, upgrading HVAC systems, installing solar panels, replacing old lighting with LED, and replacing or repairing old equipment will boost efficiency and sustainability. Potential cost reduction can be accessed by upgrading HVAC systems as you can provide ventilation on demand, saving heat and electricity. Automatic adjustment of ventilation within the facility building is also eco-friendly. Lighting, ventilation and air conditioning should be optimized automatically based on the occupancy of the facility buildings. 6. Track employee attendance properly Facility managers cannot be at all places at all times, making it extremely difficult to manage the facility’s workforce without automated software. Another way to improve facility management operations is to adopt employee attendance tracking software to ensure workers are performing tasks allotted to them at the designated location within the facility. Truein is a hardwareless time and attendance management system based on cloud infrastructure. Facility managers can use Truein to track employee locations using geofencing and GPS targeting . For facility workers, the app offers the option to record attendance using their smartphones. This software uses face recognition technology to identify employees. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion As a facilities manager, you will come across opportunities and face new challenges, but with appropriate tools, you can streamline the operations.

As a result, most of the budget planning for a manufacturing company is around labor cost optimization. If your company is struggling with managing the cost of labor continuously, then there is a need for a successful cost reduction strategy. In this article, we will explore how to reduce labor costs in manufacturing by efficiently balancing resources and the workforce. We explored several direct and indirect methods to improve a manufacturing company’s bottom line. Read on to learn what methods some of the most successful manufacturing companies use to reduce labor costs. Table of Contents Four ways to reduce the labor cost in the manufacturing industry 1. Reduce the number of working hours and cut overtime if not required 2. Train employees when they are not performing well 3. Create a proper schedule of how many work hours and how many employees required 4. Invest in automated machines and software How can Truein help? Conclusion Four ways to reduce the labor cost in the manufacturing industry 1. Reduce the number of working hours and cut overtime if not required You can save a lot of money by converting full-time jobs into part-time roles by reducing the number of working hours. If your manufacturing unit struggles to keep the budget low frequently, it is preferable to reduce the number of hours than the headcount. An easy way to reduce the number of working hours is by job sharing, where two part-time employees share a full-time role. There are several benefits of this approach. It cuts labor costs, reduces the need for extra office space, and makes shift scheduling easier. Manufacturing companies can also downsize office space by reducing employee hours through job sharing. As fewer workers will be there, say about just half the usual, so less workspace will be needed during a shift. 2. Train employees when they are not performing well One of the reasons for increased labor costs in manufacturing companies is poor productivity. When the workers are not properly trained to perform their duties, they are more likely to commit mistakes, and the manufacturing process has to be repeated. This is why it is essential to monitor their performance and individual contributions to be able to customize a training program for them. Establishing a training plan for employees is how you can reduce labor costs in manufacturing. There should be initial training when onboarding new labor and an ongoing training regime to ensure that employees stay current. A well-trained workforce in the manufacturing company is necessary to enhance productivity and reduce rework. It is also beneficial for the workers as they can perform their roles much better and take further initiative. 3. Create a proper schedule of how many work hours and how many employees required Another effective way to reduce labor costs is to create a proper employee schedule . Overscheduling is common in manufacturing companies due to poor shift scheduling. This is why some companies still bear avoidable labor costs in any operation. As a manager, when you don’t have access to correct information about the production demands, workforce, and skill sets, your scheduling will be a “best guess.” Here scheduling software can provide the needed information for well-planned schedules. Managers can use the software to have complete information about the workforce, available employees, and production demand. This ensures they make their scheduling decisions from the data, not guesswork. You can checkout our guide on manufacturing shift scheduling here and create shift schedules that actually works for your organization. Adopting scheduling software is how you can ensure that your business is always adequately staffed to meet the demands and eliminate any excessive and unnecessary labor hours. It is also a way to keep employees happy, as a study by Harvard University shows that 70% of workers’ schedules are changed last minute, disrupting their personal and financial lives. 4. Invest in automated machines and software Technology is the solution for cost management in several industries. If you are wondering how to reduce labor costs in manufacturing, it is through adopting automated machines and software. Many manufacturing units can substantially reduce labor costs by automating or assisting processes with efficient tools. For example, using the internet of things sensors within the manufacturing industry helps reduce technicians’ workload. Automation is also the answer to increase productivity and reduce the total time it takes to manufacture goods. You can save a lot of money otherwise spent on manual labor costs. How can Truein help? Truein is a complete employee attendance and time tracking software that you can deploy without additional hardware. It is cloud-based employee management and shift scheduling software that offers features like attendance tracking, overtime calculation, real-time tracking through geofencing and GPS targeting , leave management , shift scheduling, and much more.

Gaining access to quality labor can be expensive. According to Statista, the US employment cost index has seen a significant surge of up to 0.7 percent in 2020. Add the horrendous impact of the pandemic on the construction industry, companies are struggling to pay their employees and looking for ways to reduce labor costs without reducing headcounts. Without proper strategy and management on reducing labor costs, you can be left with less-than-optimal profits or worse debt. Fortunately, there are some ways in which businesses can reduce labor costs in the construction industry. In this article, we discuss how businesses can reduce the overall labor cost in the construction industry. Table of Contents Why is reducing labor costs in construction necessary? How to reduce labor costs in construction 1. Estimate labor costs at the start of the construction project 2. Review your site crew structure and see if you have the skilled workers for the tasks 3. Streamlining your workflow schedule 4. Go paperless Conclusion Why is reducing labor costs in construction necessary? In the construction industry, more than 61% of the final sales price of a project goes into building costs. These costs generally include the cost of labor and materials. For most of the projects, it splits 50/50 between the cost of labor and materials, but for some projects, it can be up to 30/70. The construction services industry keeps the gross margin close to 19% , but that’s on paper. Your profits can dip to a low if the costs of building the project are not appropriately managed. Little can be done about the building materials because you need materials to complete a project. However, efficient management can lower labor costs without taking money away from your employees. Here are some ways to reduce labor costs for a construction project. How to reduce labor costs in construction Over the years, the construction industry has devised inventive and ingenious ways to reduce labor costs without sacrificing quality or cheating workers. Let’s take a closer look at how it’s done. 1. Estimate labor costs at the start of the construction project Unless it’s your first construction project, you will have a good idea of what labor costs will be involved in the project. To provide an estimate, you must use your previous experience with similar projects as a benchmark. You have to consider employee turnover and the increase in the cost of labor. You have two choices – a time and materials contract and a fixed-price contract for the project. In a time and materials contract, you calculate labor costs per hour, and the material prices are flexible and can increase or decrease depending on the project’s demand. A fixed-price contract has a total value estimation for a set project. You have to deliver the project within the quoted price. While a time and materials contract pays more, as your client will pay the exact cost of the work based on labor rate and cost of materials, you can quote a higher price. However, there is no structure to project completion here, and construction work progresses on the go. A fixed-price contract is more rigid, with well-defined documentation of specific phases and deadlines. Unless your project goes beyond the defined outline, the price won’t change. Some construction business owners find it risky, but this type of contract has defined expectations, and it’s much easier to keep the project on track. 2. Review your site crew structure and see if you have the skilled workers for the tasks In recent years the construction industry has been through a lot. First, the housing crisis of 2008 led to the loss of more than 2 million workers between 2007 and 2011. Then the global pandemic forced numerous construction businesses to suspend labor, close projects, and terminate employees. All these events have highlighted the need for the correct site crew structure. Every construction business has a composite of employees. There are skilled and unskilled workers. Interestingly, many business owners do not understand how to reduce labor costs by giving the right task to appropriately skilled laborers. You must review your site crew structure to ensure that the right people lead the teams. If you have put someone in the position of a supervisor who is better as a worker, consider providing them further training to make them better leaders. This is important to get quality work out of them. Another critical aspect is ensuring your most skilled workers do what they do best. Don’t cut on paying them for their performance. It might sound counterintuitive; how can you reduce labor costs when you are spending more money? You are missing the point of quality work. Suppose if one of the supervisors in your team is excellent at electrical work but spends more time overseeing lesser skilled workers, you might be losing money. Their electrical work, such as wiring and lighting, might need redoing. Think about how much it will cost you to redo the entire work. This is why giving skilled workers the right job can help you reduce labor costs. 3. Streamlining your workflow schedule In every construction business, it is essential to streamline the workflow. The hard part is how you facilitate the workflow schedule. First, you must ensure that your work flowcharts are created with realistic goals and expectations. Second, workflow schedule charts must be well-defined. They must explain the nature of work and mention which laborer fits best in which subgroup. The workflow schedule must also clearly define the time for each task to get completed. Match over the days’ progress of your construction crew with the workflow schedule chart. Discuss and ask for feedback from leaders to make the necessary changes to streamline the workflow schedule. 4. Go paperless By digitizing documents such as workflow schedules and performance charts, you can make better decisions on reducing labor costs. Going paperless allows you to stay on top of processes without visiting the site. Your supervisors don’t have to waste their time completing paperwork. There is no need to enter data into a system manually. With automation, you can easily track the construction project’s production at every phase. Truein is an AI-powered face recognition time and attendance management software based on the cloud network. With this software, you can ensure workers are present on site through GPS and geo-fencing features. It tracks attendance in real-time, offers shift scheduling, and eradicates time punch errors .

What Is Geofencing and How Does It Work? May 28, 2024 Geofencing is an important technology, especially with the increasing number of intelligent devices. Existing for a few years, businesses now see geofencing’s full potential. One of the predominant uses of the technology is in the marketing domain for targeting local ads. Another domain that uses geofencing technology is the employee attendance tracking system. According to market reports , the geofencing market is expected to reach US $ 1,825.30 million by 2022, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 27.5%. What supports such buzzing growth of this technology, and how it works? Let’s find out. Table of Contents What is geofencing? How geofencing works? Geofencing applications and uses 1. Social networking for location-based stories, posts, and ads 2. To send in-store promotions to users 3. Security for people and devices 4. Companies use it to monitor employees' location The future of geofencing Conclusion What is geofencing? Geofencing is a location-based service for an app or software that uses GPS, Wi-Fi, RFID, or cellular data to trigger a pre-programmed action when a device enters the pre-determined virtual boundary set up around a location as a geofence. The technology can trigger several actions depending on the application. In advertising, it is used for mobile push notifications, trigger text messages and alerts, or displaying targeted ads on social media. In security applications, geofencing tracks vehicle fleets and disables certain technologies, or provides authentication. Some secured areas use a geofence to manage traffic. Whenever someone enters or leaves the secured area, an alert is generated. Businesses can benefit from employee attendance systems like Truein that use geofencing to monitor workers on the field, automate the time and attendance recording, and ensure employees are present at the designated site when punching in. How geofencing works? First, a developer or administrator has to set up a virtual boundary for a specific location in GPS or RFID-enabled software. It is the same as setting location on Google Maps when we put the radius for a certain distance. In mobile applications, Google Maps API is used to enable geofencing. Once the targeted device enters the virtual geofence, the response is triggered. In mobile applications, the geofence is hard coded within the application because the users have the option to opt-in to enable location access for the application for the geofence to work. An example of such use is when people visit a concert or an event. They get an option to download an app automatically to get more information and instruction about the event. Modern devices like iPhones also have geofencing capabilities that users can implement. For instance, iPhone users can set up iOS Reminders triggered when they reach a chosen address or location. The functioning of a geofence is based on the “if this, then that” command. In this approach, the app’s action is programmed to trigger a movement based on another activity. For instance, some home automation apps have set up rules like “If I am 3 feet away from the door, turn on the lights.” We used examples of mobile applications to make it easier for you to understand the work. Geofencing is a technology that has myriad applications in the shipping industry, agriculture, mining, and drone technology. Geofencing applications and uses As the use of mobile devices is rising, the scope of geofencing technology is broadening. Today, it has become a standard practice for many businesses to use geofencing to identify and target prospective customers. The number of opportunities it offers for micro-managing actions is vital for marketing and social media applications. It is an easy way to target competitors’ customers with geofencing. Many retail and hospitality businesses set up a geofence around their competition. When customers approach the boundary, they get a push notification with an offer prompting them to visit the other establishment. Similarly, retail stores use geofencing to offer customers coupons when they enter the vicinity of their stores. But let’s take a closer look at what geofencing is used for in different sectors: 1. Social networking for location-based stories, posts, and ads The most recognizable use of geofencing is by social networking websites and apps to serve location-based content to users. For instance, Snapchat has location-based filters, stickers, and shareable content, made possible due to geofencing. Facebook also uses the same technology to provide more relevant content like nearby events, people, or offers. Google’s Adwords ad network uses geofencing to trigger ads at a particular location. When searching for a service or content, Google ads are served based on your location. 2. To send in-store promotions to users It is easy to understand that the ability to target an audience based on its location opens limitless marketing opportunities. From serving location-based ads to delivering in-store promotions, geofencing can help businesses increase the ROI on their advertisement and marketing spending multifold. When you can target an audience based on their location, you save costs and spend on running broader marketing campaigns. Digital ads are entirely dependent on geofencing technology to provide targeting features. With millions of brands running billions of ads, it is impossible to reach with right people with the right offers without this technology. The caching technology, when combined with geofencing, allows advertisers to serve ads to people who visited the geofenced location even when they leave. 3. Security for people and devices There is no denying that geofencing can be an invasive technology, but it is solely dependent on how developers and engineers propose to use it. On the contrary, geofencing can enable more security for locations, people, and devices. An example is Android’s ‘Locate My Phone’ or ‘Unlock My Phone’ features that work based on the device’s location. 4. Companies use it to monitor employees' location Companies use geofencing for workforce management. There are software solutions like Truein that allow companies across industries to track employee time but with the added assurance of ensuring workers are indeed present at the geofenced location when they clock in. It is making it easier for companies where workers spend most of their time off-site fieldwork to manage and accurately pay the employee. Truein is a face recognition employee time tracking and attendance software . Its cloud-based architecture supports geofencing by default. You can easily automate time cards and monitor the location of employees when they are clocking in or out. With Truein you can also check on workers taking too long or frequent breaks during work. Apart from location targeting, it also offers overtime calculation, leave management , attendance policy creation, and easy integration with most payroll software. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account The future of geofencing If you pay attention to the “targeting” aspect of geofencing technology, you can assume how it can be risky in specific scenarios. Location-based marketing has privacy concerns, and many people are uncomfortable with the idea of their location being tracked by apps or businesses. This is stirring laws, and Massachusetts became the first state to enact a consumer protection law restricting location-based marketing. Despite privacy concerns, geofencing technology is steadily growing. Experts believe the growth is sustainable because of the “technological advancements in the use of spatial data and increasing applications in numerous industry verticals.” Conclusion We hope this article gives you a clear explanation of what geofencing is and how it works. With the digital penetration of the internet, it is possible to reach people with the offers and services they want and when they want them. Geofencing has applications in many industries and is expected to keep growing amidst privacy concerns. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

What Is Overtime and How To Calculate It? May 20, 2024 For companies, overtime is a serious consideration, given its financial implications on the bottom line. If your workforce is limited and you have to manage overtime for a few workers, it can usually be done using a paper system. But as the company grows or you expand to several locations or countries, it becomes complex to comply with overtime laws. There are several factors to consider, and you need proper tools to record and calculate overtime. This article explores what overtime is and how to calculate overtime easily. Table of Contents What is overtime? How to calculate overtime pay? 1. Single hourly rate 2. Multiple hourly rates 3. Daily rate 4. Piece rate How to automate overtime calculation? Conclusion What is overtime? Overtime pay is the wage paid to employees who work more than 40 hours a week. The federal overtime law entitles workers working more than 40 hours a week should get paid more than their regular base pay. As per Indian Labor laws, employers are required to pay double the normal wage rate for the number of extra hours a worker puts in at the workplace. In the United States, Federal overtime laws mandate that employees who work more than 40 hours in the week should be paid at least time and a half for the overtime hours . For example, if a worker’s regular wage is $20 an hour, they must be paid $30 for each hour of overtime they put in. Overtime is essential in the American workforce law enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Previously, the overtime law was that an employee was not entitled to extra pay until they had worked 44 hours a week, but later on, it was amended to a 40-hour workweek. Overtime is a valuable strategy for employers and employees. It allows companies to meet the increased production demand with the same number of workers without hiring contractual staff. On the other hand, the workers can make an additional income by putting in more hours at their convenience. That being said, for any company, it is essential to check overtime expenses because it has profound economic implications. The overtime calculation is a complex process that requires accurate timekeeping of the number of extra hours. Managers are responsible for accurately calculating overtime pay and ensuring that their overtime policies comply with state and local labor laws. Let’s find out how to calculate overtime accurately. How to calculate overtime pay? To calculate a worker’s overtime pay, you must accurately determine their overtime hours and usual hourly wage. These are the two inputs that we use for further calculation. 1. Single hourly rate The simplest way to calculate overtime pay is the single hourly rate. Suppose a worker gets paid $10 an hour and works 60 hours per week. Given the standard of 40 hours work week, they work 20 hours overtime. Their overtime pay will be calculated as follows: $10 x 1.5 (overtime rate) x 20 hours of overtime = $300 Total pay: $400 + $300 = $700 2. Multiple hourly rates Let’s assume that an employee does two jobs in your company that pay him different hourly pay rates. The first one pays them at an hourly rate of $ 25 for 20 hours per week, and the second job pays them $ 15 hourly for 30 hours per week. In this scenario, their regular wage rate for the week will be the average of the two pays. The overtime will be calculated as follows: Average weekly pay: $25 x 20 hours + $15 x 30 hours = $950 $950/50 hours = $19 Overtime pay: $19 x 1.5 (overtime rate) x 10 hours of overtime = $285 Total Pay: $950 + $285 = $1235 (total) 3. Daily rate If an employee is paid $100 a day for five days a week for 50 hours, then to calculate their regular rates, we need to divide the weekly income by the number of hours. Here’s how the overtime is calculated in this case: $100 x 5 = $500 $500/50 hours = $10 (regular rate) $10 x 1.5 (overtime rate) x 10 hours (overtime) = $150 Total pay: $500 + $150 = $650 4. Piece rate The piece rate overtime calculation is used by the companies that pay workers for every product unit. Suppose a worker at a mobile phone assembly unit is paid $1.50 for each phone completed. If they meet 500 phones in a standard 40-hour workweek, their pay will be: Five hundred phones × $1.50 piece rate=$750 If the same worker puts in an additional 10 hours and produces another hundred phones, then his overtime pay will be calculated as follows: Average week pay: $750/40 hours = $18.75 Overtime pay: 10 hours × $18.75 = $187.50 How to automate overtime calculation? Now that you understand what is considered overtime and how it is calculated, you should consider tools that can automate overtime calculation. Several employee time and attendance tracking software are available that feature overtime calculation. Truein is one such software for employee time tracking that is already adopted by hundreds of companies globally for accurate overtime calculation.

Failing to pay overtime accurately makes your business susceptible to lawsuits from current and former workers. It can also put you on the wrong side of the law. For instance, any company failing to comply with the FLSA’s overtime rules can pay 200% more than overtime in the first place. This is why you must use overtime management software like Truein that manage overtime efficiently to ensure that your employees are paid accurately every time.

What Is Employee Self-Service, How It Works and What Are The Benefits? May 28, 2024 A degree of self-reliance is essential for employees in any organization. Many companies have employee directories, a highly desirable HR tool. A survey shows that 73% of US employees prefer self-service HR tools. Just as consumers can do transactions with online banking or self-checkout at supermarkets, the workplace can also have a certain degree of autonomy and automation. With employee self-service (ESS), your workers can request time off, record attendance, track work time, and much more. In this article, we discuss how your company can benefit from ESS. Table of Contents What is employee self-service (ESS)? How does ESS work? Five benefits of employee self-service (ESS) 1. An employee can view their data and apply for leave easily 2. Data is centralized, accurate, and can be easily accessed by managers and employees 3. Saves HR time 4. Easily manage remote employees 5. Compliant with government laws Conclusion What is employee self-service (ESS)? Employee self-service is a system that offers significant automation for the HR department to work more efficiently and save valuable company resources. At the same time, it increases data accuracy by enabling employees to take up some administrative matters on their own. For instance, workers can add, update or delete information about them without interference from managers or supervisors. This improves the accuracy of the data as workers are not likely to commit errors when recording their details. As the need for a digital workplace is increasing, and organizations are adopting digital transformation, it is becoming increasingly necessary to look for solutions beyond Excel spreadsheets and word documents. ESS offers a digital solution for companies to automate workforce management, save valuable working time, create transparency and ensure data accuracy, all of which increase employee satisfaction. How does ESS work? Automation of various administrative functions is what an employee self-service system is about. Modern software tools help companies gain employee access to different functions. The ultimate goal here is to optimize the administrative processes by allowing workers to perform specific tasks such as time tracking, attendance recording, annual leave planning, and updating staff information on their own. For instance, when a worker requests leave, it is sent to the superiors, who can validate it with a single click. This gives freedom from visiting the human resources and printing out leave requests for approval. With ESS, the working hours can be tracked and monitored within seconds, which helps with overtime calculation, shift scheduling, and much more. Furthermore, employees can handle and edit their information keeping it correct without visiting the HR manager. A self-service system significantly increases the workforce and the HR department’s efficiency. Five benefits of employee self-service (ESS) 1. An employee can view their data and apply for leave easily One of the essential ESS benefits is the ability for employees to manage their paperwork and edit any errors. This gives them the freedom to keep the employment information up to date and include any relevant changes without seeking permission from HR. Workers can also use an employee self-service system to apply for leaves digitally and instantly. 2. Data is centralized, accurate, and can be easily accessed by managers and employees Data centralization is at the core of ESS. For any company to accurately manage employee data accessible to workers and managers, it must be kept at a central location. This brings transparency and accuracy between teams, departments, and workforce management. 3. Saves HR time Understanding how an employee self-service system can save valuable HR time is not complex. Employee time and attendance systems like Truein can dramatically improve time and attendance recording for any industry. It is a cloud-based, face-recognition attendance system that updates data in real time at a central location. HR managers can easily see employee attendance, overtime, leave requests, and absences, create attendance policies , and put GPS and geo-fencing based on rules. Truein integrates with most payroll software, saves a lot of time, and minimizes the scope for any human error in salary calculation. 4. Easily manage remote employees Employee self-service systems are entirely decentralized and often use cloud-based infrastructure, making them accessible from any device and location. This is why it can be used for managing remote as well as in-house employees with equal ease. As employees can access the ESS system from anywhere, there is no need to manage a different system for remote employees. 5. Compliant with government laws It is challenging for companies with large workforces spread across different states or even countries to comply with several local and state labor laws. An employee self-service system can help be compliant with government laws. Several government regulations, such as EEO, OSHA, and FMLA, have stringent reporting requirements. With an ESS system, you can help reduce human mistakes and easily avoid penalties, fines, or potential lawsuits. Some systems also come with the ability to generate reports in the required government format for easy reporting. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion If, as a manager, you are struggling to manage the workforce’s leave and attendance, consider implementing an ESS system.

How To Track Employee Time and Attendance? May 31, 2024 For a successful business, workforce management is essential. Rising labor costs can be a trouble that can spiral out of control, fast eating up profits. How to track employee time and attendance to handle workforce expenses better? You need reliable attendance tracking that can provide data to get an overview of the expenses to stay within budget, maintain accurate records, and remain compliant with labor laws. Whether a small business or an enterprise, there is a need for taking time and attendance for smooth workplace functioning. We have put together this guide to give you an overview of available options to track employee time and attendance. Table of Contents Five ways to track employee time and attendance 1. Paper-based attendance registers or timesheets 2. Manually recording employee hours in a spreadsheet 3. Swiping an employee ID card, key card, or badge 4. Biometric time and attendance tracking systems 5. Software-based employee attendance systems Conclusion Five ways to track employee time and attendance 1. Paper-based attendance registers or timesheets Attendance registers or timesheets are the oldest ways to track employee time and attendance. Evidently, with modern tools available, paper-based attendance recording is an outdated way that’s counter-productive. HR managers have to spend tedious hours maintaining attendance registers which is not a productive utilization of their time that could be better invested in action-oriented work. With the changing work environment and various work modes, such as remote hybrid work culture becoming popular, paper-based timesheets are no longer relevant. Also, calculating employee working hours manually every day adds to the administrative burdens, which can be easily avoided with automated attendance systems. 2. Manually recording employee hours in a spreadsheet Most small businesses use spreadsheet programs like Excel to manage employee attendance. While in comparison to paper systems, it is an upgrade, in 2022, the technology has become outdated. Compared to modern software tools, spreadsheets are categorized as manual entry systems. The requirement is to manually enter employee time and attendance data, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Manual attendance keeping is a repetitive task that can lead to employee burnout. Another issue with manually recording employee hours in the spreadsheet is no security is provided to keep the data safe. With the rise of cybersecurity concerns, any online attendance tracking system implemented in an organization must be fully secured. 3. Swiping an employee ID card, key card, or badge Another way to track employee time and attendance is with card swipe time clocks, key cards, and employee ID cards. Punch cards were popular to record employee time and attendance during the 80s. It is not difficult to imagine a line of workers queuing up at a manufacturing unit to start their workday. Some industry is still using punch cards, but their drawbacks, like buddy punching and other time theft fraudulent behavior , cost employers too much money. A modern equivalent of punching card machines is the card swipe time clock. Such a time and attendance system require employees to swipe a scanned badge or employee ID card to automatically upload data into the system. While these systems are not as secure as biometric time clocks, they still offer a level of automation and can be a feasible option for some companies. 4. Biometric time and attendance tracking systems The most widely implemented attendance tracking hardware is the biometric system that recognizes and records attendance based on the employees’ biometric data. It significantly improves physical ID cards that can be lost or forgotten. These systems use employee fingerprints, retinal scans, or facial recognition to offer security and accurate attendance. Biometric Time and attendance-keeping systems eliminate time fraud and human errors that can contribute to maintaining a safer work environment. 5. Software-based employee attendance systems The pandemic forced companies to adopt attendance systems that are easy to manage and offer touch-free operation. The software-based employee attendance systems are designed to offer cloud-based centralized control over employee data. This provides them with unmatched security and scalability. Today, software-based employee attendance systems are used in several industries for workforce management. Truein is one of the best software-based employee attendance systems. It is a hardware-less, cloud-based face recognition attendance system that offers exclusive features such as leave management , attendance policy implementation, geo-fencing and GPS tracking , and easy integration into most payroll systems. Truein is a cloud-based application that employees and managers can use directly through their phones as an app. It uses AI-based technology for facial recognition, which makes it highly accurate. Industries like construction, manufacturing, and mining require Truein to easily record the attendance of workers without relying on biometric features like fingerprints that can be covered in dirt or smudged with oil, making recording attendance challenging. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion For a profitable business, you need to manage your labor costs and other workforce expenses efficiently.

When a company cannot keep a tab on the absenteeism rate in the workforce, it can severely affect the output and the bottom line. While HR has always struggled to decide how to reduce absenteeism in the workplace, some new solutions are coming up. In this article, we look at some ways how to reduce absenteeism. But first, let’s start with the definition. Table of Contents What is absenteeism? Seven ways to reduce absenteeism in the workplace 1. Creating an attendance policy 2. Reward employees with good attendance 3. Address unscheduled absences immediately 4. Find ways to reduce employee stress 5. Offer flexible working option 6. Communicate with employees and provide feedback 7. Keep track of employee absences Conclusion What is absenteeism? Absenteeism is when a worker willfully and regularly comes into work without providing an “acceptable reason.” The critical word here is ‘acceptable,’ which doesn’t include authorized absences such as holidays, health appointments, paid leaves, illness, childcare, etc. However, it is tricky to define absenteeism as the word, as there are instances when long-term health problems, burnout, or stress resulting from the workplace can cause absenteeism. All these are legitimate health issues that need to be addressed. As a manager or supervisor, you’ll have to accommodate seldom staff absences from time to time. However, if it becomes seemingly frequent, you must take the following measures. Seven ways to reduce absenteeism in the workplace 1. Creating an attendance policy Your workers must be able to aware of what are the company attendance policies. Therefore, the company attendance policy should be clear, and every employee should be mindful of the consequences they can face due to frequent absenteeism. All the points must be mentioned, including what counts as unaccepted absence, how the company follows up on unsanctioned leaves, and how employment can be affected due to excessive absenteeism. To ensure that workers are adhering to the policy seriously, managers must enforce it consistently. 2. Reward employees with good attendance Most of the resources on how to decrease absenteeism in the workplace talk about the steps you can take to mitigate the challenge but often miss out on rewards. It would help to reward the employees for good attendance records to encourage such behavior. Adding an incentive to attend work is one of the best ways to let employees voluntarily keep attendance high. The attendance system should not penalize the employees for legitimate reasons for being absent such as illness or childcare. 3. Address unscheduled absences immediately One of the reasons why absenteeism becomes such a significant problem for a company is when managers cannot immediately take action to address unscheduled absences. As mentioned, it is mandatory to implement the attendance policy consistently and hand out consequences. However, it must not be a knee-jerk reaction to every absentee; managers and supervisors should evaluate the reason for the absence and support the workers if needed. Remember that addressing unscheduled absenteeism is not only about dishing out sanctions but creating a clear divide between what is acceptable and what is not. A recommended way to reduce staff absenteeism is to introduce the return-to-work interview. There are many benefits – it shows companies care for the staff, helps workers ease into their roles, and reduces the rate of repeated absenteeism. 4. Find ways to reduce employee stress You must first check that the working environment is not stressful or unhealthy for the workers. The solution to reducing absenteeism in the workplace lies in understanding the root cause of the problem. It is not unusual for workplace stress to cause high employee absenteeism . Explore options like implementing a wellness program and making your workers’ health one of the top priorities. Employees who are physically and mentally healthy are more productive and engaged. 5. Offer flexible working option A proper work-life balance is essential for workers. Offering a flexible work schedule has proven to be one of the most efficient ways to increase the workforce’s well-being and attachment to the company. If possible, introduce flexible working hours or even remote work. For instance, Netflix offers unlimited vacation days for employees, contributing to its employee engagement plan. 6. Communicate with employees and provide feedback An easy way to reduce absenteeism in organizations is to improve employee engagement through proper communication. Set up an efficient internal communication system for workers to quickly follow up about the company’s workings, suggest improvements, report problems, and get feedback about their attendance. 7. Keep track of employee absences To implement these tips successfully, you need reliable attendance management software like Truein. Truein is a cloud-based, hardwareless employee time and attendance management software that can track daily attendance, absences, and holidays and keep track of sanctioned leaves.

How To Create An Effective Employee Attendance Improvement Plan? May 17, 2024 Meeting business goals can become complicated if you cannot manage employee attendance at the company. Poor attendance eats up revenue, reduces productivity, and drains employees’ morale, who have to pick up the slack. If absenteeism has started affecting the company’s bottom line, you need an employee attendance improvement plan. Every company needs an attendance improvement plan because, according to Reference.com , the average number of sick days per employee is 5.2. At the same time, it may not seem like a significant number, but when you multiply it by the number of employees, you will see the problem. This is why it is essential to implement an employee attendance improvement plan. This article will discuss how you can better track and manage employee attendance. Table of Contents Why do you need an employee attendance improvement plan? Six tips for creating an employee attendance improvement plan 1. Create a clear and easy-to-understand employee attendance policy 2. Track the attendance of employees 3. Identify the causes of absence 4. Explain what will happen if employees take unplanned leaves 5. Train managers on how to deal with absenteeism 6. Allow a flexible work schedule Conclusion Why do you need an employee attendance improvement plan? Before the why let’s understand an employee attendance improvement plan. An employee attendance improvement plan is the formal document that a supervisor or manager sends to an employee to address their excessive absenteeism. When an employee is regularly taking offs or is absent without notification, managers can first schedule a face-to-face meeting with them to discuss the underlying issue. Suppose the meeting doesn’t solve the issue. In that case, you can share the employee attendance improvement plan to help workers understand the problem and the consequences of their continued absence. Good employee attendance is essential to ensure productivity is maintained in the company. Also, for customer-facing jobs, proper employee attendance means consistent service with minimal waiting time. It improves the customer experience and boosts brand loyalty. Your organization needs a comprehensive employee attendance improvement plan to prevent distracting other employees, burdening the management with overtime costs, and diminishing team morale. If your company struggles with employee absenteeism , here are some tips for creating an employee attendance improvement plan. Six tips for creating an employee attendance improvement plan 1. Create a clear and easy-to-understand employee attendance policy An attendance policy is a must for every organization. Even it is a legal requirement to inform the workers about their attendance rights so they can feel more in control of how they manage their work and personal lives. Before creating an employee attendance improvement plan, you have to provide them with an attendance policy so they can be held responsible if they are not following the instructions. Managers should take the time to create an attendance policy that’s transparent and employee-friendly. We assume you already have an attendance policy in place; all it might need are a few amendments to include the following. From the beginning, ensure that company’s expectations about employee attendance are mentioned. Encourage feedback from workers about the policy, and if there are some suggestions, be open to incorporating them into the policy for the betterment of the workers. Be transparent about the consequences workers might face if they don’t meet the expectations. It is also necessary to be precise with the language. The attendance policy must be easy to understand, and there should not be any ambiguity that might confuse the workers. Try to be specific and detailed about the policy guidelines. The employee attendance improvement plan template will help to reach out to employees. 2. Track the attendance of employees Suppose an employee is sick; how easy is it for them to request a leave? Or, how easily can you track the no-shows if there are absences? To ensure that employees can stick with the attendance policy guidelines, facilitate the easy request, approval, and tracking of employee absences. For this purpose, invest in quality employee time and attendance management software like Truein. It is a cloud-based, AI-powered face recognition attendance system that offers total employee time and attendance tracking features a company requires. Employees can quickly request information about absences through the Truein app on their smartphones. Managers and supervisors are instantly notified about the request. Not every time do you need to give a worker the employee attendance improvement plan if they do not show up for work. Tracking their absences keeps you in the loop and informed about their leave. You have the opportunity to arrange for a replacement. Truein tracks the attendance of employees in real time and can produce insights that can help you decide on whether a worker should be given the employee attendance improvement plan or not. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 3. Identify the causes of absence Poor attendance is not always due to unfriendly work culture or lack of worker discipline but can be an indicator or a more significant problem. You must identify the cause of absence. Usually, it’s an injury or illness which cannot be controlled, but if the reasons are one of the following, you need to provide a solution: A conflict between workers and supervisors can result in absenteeism. If it happens frequently, the company’s bottom line is badly impacted. Managers need to take action to identify and resolve conflicts proactively. Issues with work itself at times can result in employee absences. For instance, an unbalanced workload or unrealistic deadlines can push workers into a corner. It affects their mental well-being. Lack of training can also be a reason for poor productivity at work. Personal issues and family commitments can also result in absences. All these issues must be resolved at a personal level. Ensure you do not initiate disciplinary action against employees before understanding why for attendance issues. It might be the worker is protected under the FMLA or ADA law. It is your responsibility to understand the problems and help workers get back on track. 4. Explain what will happen if employees take unplanned leaves Workers are less likely to take unplanned leaves if they know the company’s stance on such absences. It would help if you elaborated on the consequences and the actions that can be taken against employees who frequently take unplanned leaves. There should be complete transparency on how and what disciplinary measures will be taken. This will ensure that employees are aware of the actions that can be taken against their behavior of frequent absences. 5. Train managers on how to deal with absenteeism Managers and supervisors must be trained on how to deal with absenteeism properly. There is nothing wrong with enforcing the employee attendance improvement plan, but they must show compassion and empathy. Clear communication with absent employees, asking for their well-being and informing them about the impact of their absence on other coworkers and the overall work is a better way to take the initiative. Train managers how to personally reach out to unscheduled absentees to enquire about the circumstances. This shows workers that the supervisors and managers care about their well-being and allows them to discuss the effect of their unscheduled absence. Such an approach will encourage employees to take responsibility for their work presence. Supervisors are the first point of contact and workers reach out to them when they need to leave. Initially, supervisors should accept their requests without asking too many questions if the reasons for the absence are understood. However, they should feel free to initiate employee attendance improvement plan sharing if they see a pattern developing and employees start abusing the policy. 6. Allow a flexible work schedule The work schedule must not result in a compromise between work and life balance. Your employees will appreciate a flexible work schedule that can accommodate their requirements, such as doctor appointments, attending sick children, or jury duty. A flexible work schedule includes the option to work from home, telecommute, share jobs, or ability to swap shifts with a coworker. While a flexible work schedule may not be feasible for all companies, if it is an option for your organization, you should implement flexibility as it can improve attendance and engagement of employees. When you give freedom to employees about when and where they are from, you can eliminate call-offs due to unexpected personal issues. Like standard work schedules, all the policies regarding flexible schedules should be appropriately documented and mentioned in the attendance policy so that management can track and monitor such programs. Conclusion An employment attendance improvement plan is a powerful tool, but it should be implemented only when required. If you can implement the tips we have shared in this guide, you will be able to better communicate with your workers and understand the reason behind their absence. This will provide an opportunity to improve attendance proactively, and you are less likely to have to give workers the employee attendance improvement plan to follow.

How to Track Employee Absences? May 28, 2024 As a manager, you are responsible for managing teams and their schedules. The inability to properly track employee absences can result in more labor costs. In some industries like manufacturing, construction, and mining, it is challenging to track absentees when you are not aware if they are present onsite or not. These are some reasons your company needs a solid strategy to track team member absences. In this article, we will cover some tips on how to track employee absences. Table of Contents What is employee absence tracking? Why is tracking employee absences important? Here are some essential reasons why you must track absenteeism in the workplace. 1. Helps to manage payroll and pay employees accurately 2. The total attendance taken is transparent for both employees and employers 3. You can easily schedule shifts if the employee is not available How to track employee absences 1. A centralized telephone number where employees call and inform about their absence 2. Using messaging to inform about leaves 3. Using attendance management software Conclusion What is employee absence tracking? Employee absence tracking is what it sounds like, a way to track absences and late arrivals of workers at work. It is an essential aspect of workforce management to ensure that workers adhere to the attendance policy . Employee absence tracking is also necessary for controlling overtime and shift scheduling issues. Modern-day absence tracking is not manual, and automated tools are available that will help you to better track your employees, such as Truein. But we will discuss employee absence tracking tools in a while; before that, we will explore why your company must ensure effective absence tracking. Why is tracking employee absences important? For workforce management, you must regularly track your employees’ time, attendance, and absences. For a strong work culture, your company must have clear guidelines about absenteeism . Also, there must be open communication channels between workers, supervisors, and managers. Here are some essential reasons why you must track absenteeism in the workplace. 1. Helps to manage payroll and pay employees accurately Absenteeism is directly associated with payroll. If you are not accurately tracking employee absences, you risk paying employees for hours they have not worked. Accurate pay is vital for both the company and the employees. All employees must receive a fair wage for the work they do. For companies, it implies that there will be extra labor costs and overtime compensation. A resilient attendance tracking system is how you can efficiently track employee absences. Choose an employee absence tracking system that integrates with the organization’s payroll software for calculating employee salaries. 2. The total attendance taken is transparent for both employees and employers When you have the correct attendance data, you can maintain employee transparency. There is no hidden information or confusion regarding the pay received or action taken. Automated employee absence tracking provides complete data about the leaves taken, paid time off left, and any attendance penalty points given to workers. The same data is visible to employees too. This gives them a feeling of being in control of managing their time off. When you make the attendance data transparent, workers can balance their work and life and make up for any lapses when required. 3. You can easily schedule shifts if the employee is not available Shift schedule is badly affected if there is frequent workforce absenteeism. When you properly track employee absences, you can avoid last-minute changes to the shifts. It gives you enough time to look for a replacement and arrange for other employees to fill in the gaps. Properly planning shift schedules is how you can maintain the work balance and ensure no worker is overworked or burned out. According to the National Safety Council, overworked workers are the most susceptible to accidents . Shifts must allow employees to work without compromising their physical or mental health. In most cases, overexertion is a leading cause of work-related injuries in companies. Now that you understand how important it is to track employee absences let’s find out the best ways. How to track employee absences 1. A centralized telephone number where employees call and inform about their absence By setting up a centralized phone number for reporting absences, you can direct all calls to one place. This will save supervisors and managers from getting texts and calls throughout the day and reduce productivity. While a straightforward solution is how to track employee absences, a central phone line will still require HR to go through the calls. The call records can be filled quickly if you have a large workforce with hundreds or thousands of employees. No matter how automated the system is, in the end, a human has to verify the calls. It’s time-consuming, costly, and not sustainable for more than a few dozen employees. 2. Using messaging to inform about leaves A more approachable communication medium is texting about the leaves to inform supervisors or managers on popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. The problem with this solution is how every worker will be skilled enough to use messaging apps on their phones. Also, not everyone will be comfortable using or downloading apps mandated by the employer. For the managers, keeping track of the messages and updating the shift schedule rooster will be tedious. Furthermore, no paper trail will spell trouble for record keeping and tracking employee absences. 3. Using attendance management software For any business, irrespective of its industry or size, attendance management software is the best solution to track absenteeism in the workplace. Truein is a hardwareless employee time and attendance tracking software . It is a cloud-based attendance system that can be deployed on workers’ smartphones allowing them to request leave online.

While the other leaves are accumulated with time, comp leaves are earned through working extra hours on days offs, holidays, etc. Compensatory off is the leave that is awarded as compensation to the employees who work extra for some hours or days. This type of leave enables people to encash the leaves when required in exchange for overtime that they have earned by working extra. Companies with a comp off policy compensate the employees in the form of PTO or paid time off as the alternative to paying time and a half in overtime pay. It is thus essential to understand what time and a half are. It is 50 percent more than what a worker gets as regular pay. This means that the company is liable to pay the worker his usual salary and an extra half of that for each overtime hour he works. It might sound challenging, but overtime policy pay can be calculated by multiplying the regular pay by 1.5. Table of Contents What is Compensatory off? Types of Compensatory Leave 1. Overtime compensatory leave 2. National holiday and weekend compensatory leave Who is eligible for compensatory off? For how many days is compensatory off valid? Why Comp off was created? How to draft your Compensatory leave policy? Compensatory Off Rules Conclusion What is Compensatory off? The term’ compensatory off’, also called compensatory leave, compensatory time, or Comp hours, is the right of employees to take paid time off when they work overtime like on holidays, for extra hours, etc. Such a leave allows the employees to take off with pay in place of the overtime pay when they have worked under situations like holidays, a scheduled day off, overtime hours, or when the office is closed. It would help if you remembered that compensatory leave works differently from other leaves as the time off is accrued, hour by hour. This means that for each hour of overtime the employee works, one hour of comp time is given. So the main idea is that the company compensates the employees with paid leaves rather than giving overtime pay. Types of Compensatory Leave While the various types of compensatory leaves are like in how they function, the situations in which hours may be provided vary. 1. Overtime compensatory leave It is awarded when the employee chooses paid leave instead of overtime pay. For example, if the employee works 8 hours overtime, they can take 8 hours of paid time off on another date. 2. National holiday and weekend compensatory leave Employees who work on a national holiday or a weekend for any reason are allowed to take time off at a later date. Who is eligible for compensatory off? Only the employees who have worked for at least 40 hours in the previous week are granted compensatory offs. Employees may even take half of the Comp off if needed to work for extra 3 hours or more after their actual work time on any given day. Only the employees who have worked for at least 40 hours in the previous week are granted compensatory offs. Employees may even take half of the Comp off if needed to work for extra 3 hours or more after their actual work time on any given day. There are 4 primary groups of employees that are qualified for Comp offs under the factory law- Salary paying personnel Public sector workers, including central and state government employees Non-exempt workers who put in less than 40 hours a week like during a vacation when they are compensated but don’t take are not free from the overtime pay. Workers in some states like Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat For how many days is compensatory off valid? Deciding the limit for Comp off validity depends on the company. There is no set number of days that the Indian government stipulates. Most organizations prefer making compensatory leaves available for around 30 days, as mentioned above. Why Comp off was created? Compensatory offs can be said to be the method to attract employees into giving their best, both in return for compensation as well as appreciation. Before the making of compensation in form of payments or offs, there were a lot of grievances that plagued the employees. They were overexploitation, meager salary, and health issues. All such grievances started resulting in impacts such as anger issues, loss of interest in work, and disagreement among employers and employees. Lack of interest further resulted in situations where workers refused to put in additional efforts, leading to the company’s degradation. It additionally led to employee strikes and protests to get their rights. So, after much negotiation, it was decided to offer the employees extra leaves or cash to compensate for their efforts and the company’s development. How to draft your Compensatory leave policy? Before making a comp-off policy, it is crucial to create and communicate a clear policy to reduce any confusion. Clearly mention the criteria for Comp off eligibility that must adhere to legal restrictions Mention in which form or case the compensatory off will be fulfilled When setting the parameters for a comp off, the employer should determine how long the employees have to use the leave Documenting the policy and then reviewing it with legal personnel is a must to ensure that it complies with the laws. It is also essential to train the managers to use the policy fairly. So, before adopting a comp leave, a policy must be established. It is simple for employees and employers to know the expectations when the policy is written clearly and conveyed well. Also, when drafting the leave policy, public companies must meet all criteria. For example, the company and the association must agree to the Comp off policy if a union is involved. Deciding the eligibility – When the employer decides who qualifies for the leave, it is essential to consider the current legal limitations. The exempt workers working more than 40 hours a week will get Comp off from the employer. Will these employees require permission to get the Comp off in advance? Will the non-exempt workers qualifying criteria be different from the exempt workers? Calculation – It is also essential to establish the payment method for the Comp off. Will you give compensatory leave at an hourly price or some set price? How you will record the comp time is another concern. Is it a component of your HR software? Do you need to have supervisors keep a tab on it? Other parameters – You must also set restrictions on how to use the comp time. How long may the employees use the compensatory leave? Will there be a limit on the number of hours of comp time one may accumulate? Is there any limitation on when the Comp off may be used? Review and Training – You need to ensure that you record the policy with legal help to achieve the goal within the jurisdiction. It would help if you also guaranteed that your approach is used appropriately throughout the company and the management is well-taught about it. Compensatory Off Rules Workers who work on public holidays are compensated by taking off the next day or through a time equal to their working hours if they come to work. The same rule applies to the workers who work on weekends, as long as they are at work. If a public holiday or a weekly off falls on your work travel, you will be provided with a half-day Comp off. Also note that if you are traveling on a weekly off or a public holiday, it will not be taken as a working day and you will not get the Comp leave. Compensatory time is only provided for the time spent at the site or with clients. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion In all, compensatory leaves have multiple benefits. The employers get saved from paying the added overtime salaries for the benefit of improved employee efficiency. Also, the worker gains an extra day off, maintaining that professional and personal balance. In retrospect, one may say that comp leaves are surely a win-win situation where the employer and the employee are satisfied with the overall negotiation and policy rules. You can make policies for your employees using the Truein app. The policy can be made for employees working on weekends or holidays, and they will automatically get the Comp off. You can further create the rule for overtime if the worker works for extended hours, they will get a compensatory leave. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

Running a business 24 hours a day is quite an undertaking that demands excellent workforce management and, at the same time, flexibility for the staff members. Such organizations often have rotating shifts to meet their staffing demands. Managers can meet the production or service goals while allowing employees to learn about different aspects of the business by creating an efficient 8-hour shift schedule for seven days a week. A business that operates 24 hours requires managers to have excellent leadership, foresight, and planning. If you struggle with creating an 8-hour, 7-day work schedule, this article is for you. We are about to discuss the 8-hour rotating shift schedule and how it can create a sustainable and productive work environment. Table of Contents What is a rotating 8-hour shift schedule? 8-hour 7-day work schedule: Pros Pros for Employees Pros for Employers How to keep track of an 8-hour, 7-day work schedule? Conclusion What is a rotating 8-hour shift schedule? A rotating 8-hour shift schedule provides 24/7 coverage for any business by ensuring enough workers are available for the job without increasing their work hours to more than 40 hours per week. Such a schedule maximizes the number of consecutive days employees have off to allow them enough rest and time to spend with their family and friends. There are several ways to implement the 8-hour shift schedule for 7-days a week, such as a simple 8-hour day schedule, 8-hour swing schedule, and 8-hour night shifts. The rotating 8-hour schedule depends on your business and your industry. It’s about maximizing the schedule for efficiency to benefit employees and employers. Construction, manufacturing, restaurant and hospitality businesses often have rotating 8-hour shifts. If you are an industry veteran, you might be aware of the pros of rotating shift schedules, but if you are new to the concept, pay attention to the next section. 8-hour 7-day work schedule: Pros Maintaining 8-hour shift schedules can benefit both the employee and the employer.

The rotating shifts allow employees to have two days off in a row, that is, one weekend every week. This gives them ample opportunity to take care of their personal lives and spend time with their families. And it also contributes to their overall well-being and stability. Employees working 8-hour night shifts can have three days off after working seven consecutive nights. This added advantage of one more off provides them an incentive to work at night. An 8-hour, 7-day work schedule rotates consistently, so employees know when they are working, as the schedule changes only once a week. It avoids any confusion or last moment changes in the program. Such a schedule offers excellent work/life balance. It contributes to the employees’ productivity and encourages them to give their best at work. Pros for Employers Evidently, with an 8-hour shift schedule for 7-days a week, you can run business operations for 24 hours. The rotating shift schedule allows round-the-clock coverage with as few as four employees. If you have cost savings scheduling fewer employees helps reduce labor costs. It is also much easier for shift managers to schedule rotating shifts as they don’t change frequently. Your workers are never overworked, and there is no burnout. It reduces the possibility of accidents or errors as workers have a better attention span, reaction time, motor skills, and fewer memory lapses. This makes them better decision-makers compared to 12-hour shifts, where employees are often overworked and exhausted. The 8-hour shift schedule for 7-days a week simplifies scheduling, resulting in fewer missed alerts or communication breakdowns with the workers due to excessive shift changes. The fewer shift changes also prevent operational slowdowns. How to keep track of an 8-hour, 7-day work schedule?

Shortage of workers The manufacturing industry is reeling under the effect of a shortage of workers for several reasons, like the misconception in the minds of young professionals that this sector lacks compelling wages, sophistication, and innovation. Thus, HR must address this problem of a shortage of workforce. The teams must find the best ways possible to replenish the human capital required by the organization. Manufacturing industries should also emphasize recruiting millennials because they have good technical skills and knowledge. Millennials stigmatize the manufacturing sector as an outdated and slow career option that doesn’t go well with their idea and passion for new technologies. HR should offer attractive salary packages and other perks to the millennials so that they develop an interest in the manufacturing sector and start working in it once again. Once they gain that confidence, the workforce shortage problem will eventually subside. 2. Minimizing injuries of workers and safety incidents Manufacturing employees are in danger of industrial accidents and injuries due to their involvement with the planers, machines, lathes, and other production tools and equipment. Also, as in battery manufacturing, workers who work with dangerous chemicals are exposed to lead. Falls and trips are also common threats in the manufacturing industry. The employees are at high risk when they work on ladders, cherry pickers, high platforms, and other elevated platforms. Also, noise from the machines can harm their ears when exposed to loud sounds for an extended period. HR in the manufacturing industry must hire and retain skilled employees that can operate machines effectively and, thus, minimize accidents. Further, companies should train workers in first aid to help others and themselves in emergencies. Another solution for HR in the manufacturing sector is that the companies should conduct training activities that are focused on safety at the workplace, like operating the machinery safely, avoiding injuries and accidents, and minimizing harm in case of accidents. Lastly, the industry must have a supervisor on the ground to check if all safety procedures are carefully followed. “Promoting worker safety goes beyond just the safety manual or handbook . It’s really about creating a culture that’s committed to [and] very much focused on safety and accountability. It’s about preventing, reducing, or eliminating the severity or claim before it ultimately happens.” – Brian Kramer, Manufacturing Industry Practice Leader, The Hartford 3. Low employee engagement Another challenge the manufacturing industry HR faces is the need for more employee engagement. This is one of the most significant reasons for high turnover rates in the manufacturing sector. So by following the right employee engagement strategy, the industry can benefit from the increase in productivity. As the manufacturing sector is labor-oriented, it may be hard for the employees to maintain that work-life balance. The HRs should regularly ensure that there are various employee engagement activities within the company so that the workers do not feel demotivated. Also, there must be a reward for the achievements. HR challenges in the manufacturing units do not just end at training and development; the workplace needs to be supportive and engaging as per the needs of the employees. The employee relationship and work culture are significant in overall employee engagement. There is also a need to allow flexibility to employees for personal necessities and work-life balance. 4. Retaining workers Most HR departments in the manufacturing industry face the real challenge of retaining employees and specialized talent. Employee retention is one of the most crucial issues in the manufacturing industry. The HR department must ensure that the workers are retained through better engagement, perks, good salaries, easy work culture, a safe work environment, and more. When employees see these benefits, they will feel secure and not think of changing the organization or industry. HR must provide horizontal job options that may be less physically demanding so that the seniors are encouraged to stay in the company. It is also important to encourage the seniors to take benefit of the digital training that your firm provides so that they have the skills as per the latest trends and changes. 5. Training the employees HR also needs to provide proper training to their employees so that they can be updated with the latest developments. The HR professionals must focus on training the employees to stay ahead in the competition and to keep the staff motivated. It is also crucial for HR to offer adequate training to keep the employees updated with the latest developments in the industry and to prepare them for challenges. Training and development are critical in enhancing personal and professional growth and creating excellent employee satisfaction and stimulation. Besides the much-needed changes required in recruitment, employee retention, and worker engagement, effective training and development are at the top of the list of things that HR must focus on in the manufacturing industry to stay competitive in the global marketplace. 6. Challenges in recruiting new workers Recruitment and staffing are important parts of any organization. It has been seen that 80 percent of manufacturers recognize the importance of meeting workforce demands over the next 5 years. The challenges posed by recruiting within the manufacturing industry are deep-rooted. To address these issues, the manufacturing HR department should learn to compete with other sectors and start filling gaps. The HR department manages employee-related activities such as payroll management, recruitment, and employee development. As HR is the heart of every company, small and medium enterprises need help managing HR functions. Many organizations outsource the support or secondary work to external vendors, enabling them to focus on the primary business. Outsourcing recruiting of workers is also done so that the best of the workforce is recruited. 7. Managing attendance and shifts of workers Another challenge that the HR department in the manufacturing industry face is managing the shift and attendance of workers. Due to a lack of employee engagement, injuries, and retention issues, employees show up less, and there is a discrepancy in managing the shift and attendance.

Human resource management is complex, especially when dealing with unauthorized absences , such as workers leaving work premises without permission. Such activities can have significant implications both financially and operationally. Several problems arise if workers start leaving work premises without permission. The company’s production goals become challenging, which can significantly impact the revenue. Also, such time theft puts undue pressure on other employees who have to take up the slack. As a manager, handling such unexpected absences from work can be tricky. However, leaving the workplace without permission is misconduct, and you must understand how to handle such behavior. In this article, we will discuss how you can avoid any disruption in production by managing such absences. Table of Contents 4 ways to manage employees who leave work without permission 1. Talk to your employees about it 2. Create a plan and mention it in your policy 3. Explain the consequences of leaving early 4. Give a warning to employees who leave early What if your employee still leaves early? Can you fire them? How Truein can help with it 4 ways to manage employees who leave work without permission 1. Talk to your employees about it Before you conclude, ask the employee why they left early. Leaving work premises without permission only sometimes amounts to time theft. As a manager, you can bring genuine care and concern to the employee facing challenging family circumstances and help them figure out how to balance work and personal life. Talk to your employees because showing compassion is essential if they are going through some trouble or illness. At the same time, if you find out that the employees left early to have fun, you must let them know that you are strict with such behavior at work so they don’t take advantage of you. It is necessary to keep the lines of communication open to let employees know what you expect of them and make them realize that you will support their best work. 2. Create a plan and mention it in your policy Suppose your employees are habitually leaving the workplace without permission despite clear communication about expectations from them. In that case, it’s time to create an attendance policy and mention about it. Once you have listened to what is going on with your employees and understand the situation, you can frame policies based on the same to offer information to employees and address the issue prompting the early departures. It is crucial to provide information on family leave for accommodation for illness days such that employees are allowed to leave the workplace with permission. HR managers should work with employees to ensure that the management and workforce are on the same page about leaving work premises without permission. Your employees are a valuable resource, and being flexible with them is reasonable. Still, your plan should be framed keeping in mind that every worker can only take advantage of the company’s attendance policy. 3. Explain the consequences of leaving early Ultimately, you have to make the hard decision and hand over the consequences if someone isn’t doing their job. Exactly what the consequences of leaving work premises without permission can be will depend on your company and management structure. In some instances, you can accept a written apology from the workers. At the same time, other scenarios may demand stricter consequences, such as making up for the missed time or taking on some additional tasks. It is essential to mention the consequences worker can face if they repeatedly leave the workplace without permission. This will ensure that your employees are not surprised when they face the consequences after repeatedly violating the policy. 4. Give a warning to employees who leave early If, despite all your efforts, workers continue leaving the workplace without permission, you have to give them a warning. Chances are that you have already mentioned the consequence clearly in the attendance policy, but it’s also beneficial to create a leaving work premise without a permission warning letter. The letter should explain to your employees that chronically leaving work early will be met with stern actions, and they must correct their behavior immediately. At this stage, there is no need to put up with their excuses; ensure that you are approachable if the employee has some new information to help you make a better decision. Here is a template of leaving work premises without permission warning letter that you can use. Ref: ________ Date: _______ To (Name of the Employee) (Designation) (Department) Employee Code: ______ Sub.: Leaving early from work – Violation of Company Policy Dear Mr. / Ms. (First Name of the Employee), We regret to note that you were repeatedly leaving early from work early from (Date) to (Date) without taking any prior permission, nor have you informed the causes of leaving early. Our company does not appreciate such unprofessional conduct from its employees. All employees are required to follow the working hour’s guidelines and leave application procedure before going on any leave or leaving early. You are hereby strongly advised not to repeat such incidents in the future, as this letter serves as the final warning before any severe disciplinary action against you. We are also not deducting any amount from your salary. In case of repetition of such incidents, the company will be forced to terminate your employment. This letter will be placed on your personnel employment file. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter by signing one copy of the letter as enclosed herewith. For (Name of the Company), (Signature) (Name of the Superior Officer) (Designation) “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account What if your employee still leaves early? Can you fire them? Leaving early from work without permission is a clear act of miss conduct. You can fire a worker for leaving work premises without consent, without reasonable excuse. If a worker leaves the work premises without permission once or twice, it is appropriate to have a conversation to understand their issue. If they cannot provide an acceptable reason, you should issue them a leaving work premises without permission warning letter. And if the employee repeats the behavior of leaving the workplace without permission, they should face the consequences. Any further repetition of such behavior can lead to severe penalties such as demotion, suspension without pay, or dismissal.

PTO policy means that employees will get their pay even when they do not attend the office for a specific period. PTO leave can be taken for various reasons, including grief, sickness, vacation, marriage, or even when you want to spend some personal time with your family. Table of Contents What is PTO? How does PTO work? Types of PTO 1. Vacation time 2. Sick time 3. Personal days 4. Bereavement leaves 5. Parental leaves 6. Paid holidays 7. National holidays Floating leaves Why is it important to understand the PTO policy of your company? Advantages and disadvantages of PTO Advantages of Paid time off Disadvantages of Paid time off Conclusion How can Truein help? What is PTO? Paid time off is when you are paid for not working. It includes holidays, sick time, and all wrapped up under one category that permits you to use the time as you want. In a large organization, a PTO leave policy bundles the personal days off, vacation, and sick days in a specific block of hours rather than separating days for each reason. More and more companies now offer unlimited PTO leaves where you do not have to accrue time before taking paid leave from your work. But there are stipulations like being with the organization for a specific time. How does PTO work? PTO primarily works by allowing employees to accrue leave over a particular time. When the employees work for, say a month, a specific number of PTO leaves is granted. It is like a savings bank account- the more you invest, the more you earn the interest. For instance, salaried employees get 1.5 PTOs each month, so their accrued PTO will be 18 days collected over a year. Also alternatively, companies can allot a set number of paid time offs and hours to the employees based on what policy they have in their organization. In such cases, PTO is not accrued, but they stay constant throughout the year. This is how PTO works in traditional setups. In various systems, PTO leaves are as per the company policy. For example, a company provides 30 leaves per year- 10 vacation leaves, 10 casual leaves, 8 sick leaves, and 2 personal leaves. PTO offers employees these 30 days under a single category- Time off. The organization can also sanction all these leaves at once or divide the days into 7 for each quarter or 15 days for every 6 months. Types of PTO While many people link PTO with sick time or vacation only, the actual meaning of PTO can apply to when employees get paid while they are not working. As a result, you can say there are many types of PTO. Here we will list the most common PTO types. 1. Vacation time Vacation time is the pre-planned time that an employee takes for rest, recreation and relaxation. The amount of leaves an employee takes for vacation is typically between a few days to 2 weeks. The employee requests the time off and schedules well in advance so that there is no disruption of work while they are away. 2. Sick time Sick leaves are the period of time when the employee stays at home to recover from an injury or illness, and takes medical treatment for themselves or their family members. Mostly the sick leaves are not planned as the employees cannot predict their sickness time or when a family member will get injured or ill. In such cases, the work gets hampered to a certain extent. But there are certain cases where an employee can plan in advance to use the sick leaves, like when they are preparing for some upcoming surgery, etc. 3. Personal days Personal days are when an employee takes off from work for personal reasons other than vacation or illness. Here, employees can use the personal days according to their will, which may or may not be pre-planned. Some examples of personal days include but are not restricted to attending some appointments, moving/shifting, taking a break to prevent burnout, responding to some emergencies, etc. 4. Bereavement leaves Bereavement leave is when an employee takes off to grieve and cope with the death of some family member. The employer has the discretion to take the decision who qualifies as the immediate family member, with most companies recognizing the relatives of an employee as their immediate family members like spouse, children, parents, and parents in law, son in law and daughter in law, grandparents, grandchildren, brother, sister, or any other member from the same family. A company’s bereavement policy establishes a pre-determined amount of time that an employee can take off after the death of a family member, with some employers even offering flexibility in extending the time period over others. 5. Parental leaves Parental leaves are the days when an employee gets away from work, getting the full payment when there is a new addition to the family. Parental offs vary company by company, with some offering more parental leaves than others. There are some companies as well that are more lenient when it comes to approving parental leaves. Also, some companies offer maternity leaves to just women who are pregnant or who have just given birth. Other firms offer paternal leaves to fathers as well. Further, some companies approve parental leave for employees who choose to adopt a child. 6. Paid holidays Paid leaves are when a company offers its employees paid day off to spend some time with their family or even celebrate a publicly recognized holiday. Some companies remain open on the paid holidays and offer their employees the choice to attend the office for double the pay that day. Companies can select which holidays they offer as paid leaves with many of them recognizing approximately 10 holidays per year. 7. National holidays National leaves are the set publicly declared holidays that the employees get. The companies usually set these under their PTO policy. Floating leaves Floating holidays are the leaves when a company allows employees to choose a paid holiday. Employees can use the floating leave for publicly recognized holidays when their company doesn’t consider a specific leave a paid holiday. Some companies even allow employees to use the floating holidays for the crucial days that are non-publicly recognized like birthdays or anniversaries of the employee. Why is it important to understand the PTO policy of your company? Knowing how your company’s PTO policy works are crucial as it helps to ensure that you maximize your employee benefits. Knowing and understanding how the PTO policy works allows you to plan the time you take off and to create a healthy life-work balance. You may wish to use the PTO to address your family’s needs, recover or heal from a sickness or injury, or even take a vacation for relaxation. Knowing how the company’s PTO policy works can further help the employees to use their time at work productively and improve their overall job performance. When you understand what to expect from your PTO policies, you can use the time at work in a better way and focus on the tasks that need your attention rather than finding time to address things that need your attention outside of work. Advantages and disadvantages of PTO Advantages of Paid time off PTO policy can serve as a recruitment incentive and attract employees Provide vacation time to the employees who do not use the banked time for other things The employees can use the leaves as and when required when some unforeseen situations arise Shorter and more frequent vacations can help to maintain that work-life balance Reduces absenteeism Easier for HR to manage the leaves Offers flexibility and autonomy to employees Disadvantages of Paid time off A lot of employees may wish to take some days off at the year-end to avoid losing the leave When an employee quits, the management has to honor PTO commitments A large number of hours can look like a lot of time than it actually is to the employees who do not consider that it covers several purposes Employees may even run out of PTOs and may be required to work when they are sick or lose their pay Some employees hoard sick leaves Conclusion Employees of a company need long paid time off. An organization gains more popularity if it has an impressive PTO policy. The employee can take a break from work without affecting their pay. Companies also benefit from the PTO policy since the employees return to work with refreshed minds, more energy, and relaxation. This way, employees get more focused on work after unloading the stress. Offering several types of PTO leaves to employees provides an apparent reason for taking the leaves by employees. And due to this, the organization can better understand the employee’s situation. The company can further track the leaves taken the maximum number of times. Also, companies should include paid time offs in their policy to provide better flexibility to employees. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account How can Truein help?

While the after-effects have subsided, there is a change in the expectation of workers. Employees now want better work-life balance, flexibility, and conducive company policies. As a result, HR managers must create a creative New Year resolution to accommodate such requirements. In this article, we explore some key themes HRs must keep in mind when creating New Year’s resolutions for them. Table of Contents 8 HR New Year’s resolutions 1. Prevent employee burnout 2. Increasing employee engagement 3. Helping remote employees feel more connected 4. Give employees feedback regularly 5. Training employees who are not performing well 6. Promote a healthy work/life balance 7. Review all the HR process 8. Automate the HR process and save time Conclusion 8 HR New Year’s resolutions 1. Prevent employee burnout Devise a plan to prevent employee burnout. It is becoming increasingly important that companies’ attendance policies allow workers to maintain a healthy work and life balance. If your company can enable workers to have a hybrid work model, it can bring much-needed flexibility. A recent study found that companies that allow workers to work remotely have a 25% lower employee turnover rate than companies that don’t. Suppose you are in an industry such as construction, manufacturing, and automobile where the workforce cannot work remotely. In that case, you can plan rotating shifts to ensure workers are getting enough rest. 2. Increasing employee engagement With silent resignation becoming a common phenomenon in companies, HR’s New Year’s resolution must include increasing employee engagement. Silent resignation is when workers stop putting in effort or willingly refuse to cooperate with the management. There can be several reasons, but often poor employee engagement causes the issue. As part of your New Year’s resolution, you can introduce an employee recognition program that helps workers to feel more connected and appreciated. It is essential that your workers feel valued and are aware of the contributions they make to the organization. It is necessary to avoid their identity crisis and keep them engaged. 3. Helping remote employees feel more connected Due to the pandemic, many companies started supporting remote work. By 2022, many remote employees started reporting adverse effects on their productivity and mental well-being because they felt disconnected. While work from the home environment has its perks, the isolation can result in workers feeling left out. One way HR managers can help remote employees feel more connected is by providing more opportunities for fun. We are not referring to virtual happy hours but thoughtful and meaningful team-building activities such as casual meetings, constructive debates, and more. A recognition program can help with working teams feeling disconnected. 4. Give employees feedback regularly This year make it a point to provide employees feedback regularly. It is essential to eradicate any confusion and lower anxiety among workers. When the management is not transparent about their performance, employees assume the worst, which can severely demotivate them and lower their productivity. Providing regular performance feedback helps workers evaluate their output, and they can proactively take measures to correct their behavior. 5. Training employees who are not performing well Often all it takes to bring employees back on track if they are lacking in productivity and performance is to provide opportunities for training. HR’s New Year resolutions should include a plan for training employees who are not performing well. It is found that companies with employee training programs are twice as likely to retain workers compared to companies that do not invest in workers’ upskilling programs. 6. Promote a healthy work/life balance The growth of companies often requires workers to work harder to support the increasing demand. However, productivity and revenue should come at a cost other than your workers’ work/life balance. HR managers are responsible for ensuring that workers are not exhausted physically or mentally and show compassion towards their challenges. Make it your New Year’s resolution to promote a healthy work/life balance in your organization through policy change initiatives. Include workers during policy drafting to allow them a say in policies that will affect their life at work. 7. Review all the HR process Another significant change you can bring this year is to ensure all the HR processes are transparent and there is no bias.

Irrespective of the department a manager belongs to; they must have a basic knowledge of the principles of HRM. As a manager, you will have to deal with employees one way or the other, which is why you must understand the limitations of HRM. While human resource management systems are becoming common, they still have a long way to truly encapsulate the innate requirements of the people at the workplace. In this article, we list the limitations of human resource management that you must consider while making a decision. Table of Contents What is an HRM? Five limitations of human resource management 1. Recent origin 2. Cost of setting it up and installation 3. Time to train to use it 4. It is for regular employees and not for the contractual workforce 5. Problematic if you have a surplus of staff Conclusion What is an HRM? Human resource management (HRM) is the practice of recruiting, hiring, onboarding, and managing workers in a company. Often, HRM is used interchangeably with human resources (HR). The HR department in the company is responsible for creating, implementing, and overseeing the governance policies for the workers and maintaining the organization’s relationship with its employees. Simply put, HRM is employee management emphasizing the workers who are an asset to the business, such as skilled employees. In HRM, employees are also referred to as human capital. The HRM’s primary goal is to effectively use the workforce, reduce risks to the business, and maximize the return on investment (ROI). Five limitations of human resource management 1. Recent origin Compared to other social sciences, HRM is of recent origin. It is the reason why it lacks a universally approved academic base. As a result, different people have different definitions of the term HRM. Some managers consider it a new name for personnel management because some enterprises have renamed their traditional personnel management department to the human resource management department. A misplaced understanding of HRM results in wasted efforts. To truly benefit from the HRM, companies need a fundamental change in their very management philosophy, attitudes, and approaches. Superficial actions will not get the required results. Lack of understanding among the managers is a significant limitation of HRM that can only be overcome by changing the top management philosophy. 2. Cost of setting it up and installation HRM systems have a huge setup cost. If you are a small business, installing an HRM system can cost you thousands of dollars. Several expenses are involved in its setup, such as training staff to use it, software costs, consulting, and intensive time commitment to install and get the system running. There are several ways to cut this cost. You can use Software as a Service or SaaS HRM systems, but you will be spending hours on customer support, affecting productivity. You can also use automation software like Truein that can simplify some tasks of HRM. Truein is a hardware-less, cloud-based employee time and attendance tracking system with HR features such as overtime calculation, shift scheduling, leave management , attendance policy support, and integration with most payroll software. Schedule a free demo today and see how Truein can help your organization to overcome human resource management’s limitations. 3. Time to train to use it HRM should be implemented only after assessing the training the development requirements of the employees. As such, an implementation causes a significant shift in responsibilities, and the aspirations and needs of the workers should be considered before creating human resource policies. Organizations have to make a proper training program to ensure that the implementation of HRM is successful. The time to train employees to use HRM causes disturbance in management’s productivity and the profitability of the organizations. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 4. It is for regular employees and not for the contractual workforce The human resource management system is designed around the regular workforce and has little accommodation for the requirements of the contractual workforce. In most industries, contractual workers make up a significant part of the workforce, and no dedicated provisions for them are one of the considerable limitations of HRM. As the work, attendance, and overtime policies for contractual workers are different; they must be maintained at a different level than HRM manages policies for full-time workers. Additionally, there are no features for contract worker overtime calculation, advanced shift management, and training programs. Screenshot Showing Temporary Workers Daily Attendance With In and Out Times Daily Attendance Data of All Employees Detailed Attendance Report of Employee Over Specified Time Periods Truein features a tracking option for temporary workers for faster onsite onboarding. Contract workers can onboard themselves with a single selfie. It also allows managers to have separate overtime calculation rules for contractual workers. Schedule a free demo today and see how Truein can automate the attendance tracking of your employees! 5. Problematic if you have a surplus of staff HRM’s go-to approach for dealing with over-staffing problems is to terminate employees, offer a voluntary retirement scheme, etc. It can adversely affect the relationship between the organization and its employees. Workers cannot focus on productivity as the threat of termination always looms over them. This creates a hostile work environment and can harm workers’ mental health by putting negative psychological pressures. Conclusion HRM takes work to implement. Even some professionals need to understand its difference from regular human resources. While the limitations of human resource management we listed here are a concern, HRM has a spectacular impact on managerial effectiveness whenever it is implemented correctly. As a manager, you must find ways to overcome such limitations in your organization. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors? Mar 31, 2024 How to Start an HVAC Business?

While family and friends are available to provide support, employees need the assistance of their employers to get the right amount of time to bond and care for the newborn child before they can return to work. Working parents often struggle with balancing work and childcare, so companies should have an effective parental leave policy. An effective parental leave policy can build trust between employers and employees and result in employee retention and engagement. Below, we share a complete guide on parental leave policy and how you can write the best one for your organization. Table of Contents What is a parental leave policy? How to create a parental leave policy 1. Ask employees what they expect from the parental leave policy 2. Check what leaves your company can afford 3. Check your state and country rules 4. Write your policy and ask for suggestions from employees Conclusion What is a parental leave policy? A parental leave policy is a benefit that companies offer to employees who become new parents, allowing them paid or unpaid time off to take care of their child. With a newborn, there is a significant shift in the lifestyle of working parents due to a lack of sleep and hectic schedules. Such a change requires time to get used to, which is why companies should have provisions for parental leave. Usually, parental leave is available for both mothers and fathers. However, there can be separate maternity leaves and paternity leave policies. Depending on the provision of the company, and the state laws, parental leave can last for anywhere between two weeks and 4 months or even more. In India, the Maternity Benefit Act 1961 provides legal guidance to companies on creating a parental leave policy. It mentions that organizations must give maximum support to women employees to ensure their well-being and the well-being of their newborn or adopted child. The parental leave policy should cover both pre-and postnatal care. In the United States, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) guarantees eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, protected parental leave. FMLA applies to businesses with more than 50 employees, and workers employed for at least 12 months are eligible for parental leaves. The paid parental leave policies usually cover mothers who recently gave birth and can also include their partners. However, some companies also have adoption leave for parents who recently adopted a child and need time to adjust. Primary caregivers (the person directly responsible for the child’s care) are often offered more time off than secondary caregivers. Other parental leave policies can address additional leaves for parents who need time off to take care of children if they are sick. How to create a parental leave policy Now that you understand the parental leave policy, you should also know how to create a genuinely beneficial policy for your company. You can begin by studying how companies globally handle parental leaves. If you work for an MNC, you must understand federal and local laws regarding leaves for working parents. Another important consideration is what benefits to offer to both parents. Dad’s paternity leave policy may have fewer provisions than the maternity leave policy. Ultimately, you must create a comprehensive parental leave policy explaining each condition so that employees understand the policy better. Here are the four most important aspects of creating a successful parental leave policy. 1. Ask employees what they expect from the parental leave policy Before you start drafting the parental leave policy for your company, it is essential to involve employees. It would help if you gathered ideas and opinions from the workers regarding what they need from parental leave. For anonymity and honest feedback, you can create anonymous surveys to encourage employees to share their views. You can also set up individual meetings with female workers to understand what policies would benefit them the most. Such an approach will help managers determine which benefits are crucial to be included in the parental leave policy and which provisions can be excluded. 2. Check what leaves your company can afford While the law stipulates that parental leave for fathers and mothers can be as little as two weeks or up to 4 months and more, the company must evaluate its budget. Only some organizations can afford or support a large number of parental leaves. Managers should list the company’s goals and needs for the parental leave policies and try to create a policy around these requirements while accounting for their budget. You can begin by reviewing the parental leave plans from other companies to get an idea of what policies to include. Moving forward, you can tweak these policies and customize provisions to fit your budget, company goals, and employee needs. 3. Check your state and country rules After understanding your employee’s expectations and your company’s budget, you should research the central and local laws and regulations regarding parental leave policy. Compliance is of extreme importance to avoid any legal hassles later on. Firstly, you should start by listing the benefits required by your state or federal government and include other benefits and remaining sections of the parental leave policy later. Such a strategic approach is necessary to ensure your parental leave policy meets all the legal requirements. For instance, if your company is in California, the local law requires employers to offer employees paid family leave (PFL) . This benefit is provided for employees who have worked with their current employer for at least 12 months. As part of the policy, employers must pay 60% to 70% of the employee’s wages for up to 12 weeks during parental leave. However, this paid leave does not provide job protection like the FMLA. 4. Write your policy and ask for suggestions from employees Once you have successfully gathered data from the above three steps, it’s time to put together employees of information, company budget details, and the law requirements to create an impeccable parental leave policy for your organization. After successfully drafting the policy, you must seek feedback and suggestions for amendments from employees before making it live. Also, share the parental leave policy draft with the leadership team to know their thoughts and opinions. This step is necessary to understand better the sustainability of the policy you created and determine whether it will benefit the employees. After you have gathered all the updates, evaluate each suggestion carefully and, if viable, incorporate it into the policy before officially implementing the newly created parental leave policy. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion While no federal laws make it compulsory for companies to offer paid parental leave, some state requirements do. However, organizations are recommended to proactively provide provisions for paid and unpaid parental leave to eligible employees. Having a comprehensive and employee family, parental leave policy not only plays a vital role in improved maternal health and better mental health for working parents but also reduces health insurance costs for the employers and improves their employer brand. Truein is a complete employee time and attendance system that can help HR managers better manage leave policies. It allows managers to create and share company attendance and leave policies with employees in real-time. You can also make changes to the policies and notify all workers about these changes.

How To Calculate Labor Cost In Manufacturing? May 15, 2024 Running a manufacturing company successfully largely depends on how you manage the workforce. Labor is the most critical resource in a company, and HR managers must ensure that workers are managed efficiently. To be profitable, manufacturing companies are required to keep labor costs low. Unfortunately, many managers need to know how to calculate manufacturing labor costs. It is an important metric, and companies must analyze it for profit and loss. If you want your organization to handle poor efficiency and overspending, it’s essential to know how to calculate labor costs. In this article, we will explain how labor costs are calculated in manufacturing. Table of Contents What is the labor cost in manufacturing? What's the difference between direct and indirect costs? Direct costs Indirect costs How to calculate manufacturing labor costs 1. Calculate the hourly labor rate 2. Calculate labor hours 3. Calculate labor cost per unit How to reduce manufacturing labor costs 1. Track employee work hours 2. Keep overtime to a minimum 3. Train your staff Conclusion What is the labor cost in manufacturing? The labor cost in manufacturing is the total amount spend on workers by the company. It includes not only wages but also contract workers’ costs, taxes of labor costs, bonuses, and other costs such as employee compensation schemes. A company has to bear many costs apart from salaries, such as overtime, maternity pay, sick pay, and investments in training costs. The overall labor cost is much more than the basic employee salaries, so it is essential to keep track of the overall labor costs in manufacturing. It is necessary for smaller businesses where labor costs can make up a large percentage of the overall business operations costs. What's the difference between direct and indirect costs? To calculate the labor cost in manufacturing, you must understand the direct and indirect costs. Direct costs Direct costs are the expenses associated with the specific object that is directly used in the production of the product in the company. For instance, the raw materials and tools used for manufacturing the products are direct costs. If the employee is directly working with the raw materials or the tools in the manufacturing unit, then their salary is a direct labor cost. For instance, in a juice-making factory, the workers who control the ingredient mixing machines are direct laborers. Usually, the salaries of engineers, production supervisors, assembly line workers, and truck drivers are direct labor costs. You must know how to calculate direct manufacturing labor costs to reduce production costs. Indirect costs Indirect labor costs are expenses not directly associated with a specific product or tool used for manufacturing products at the company. A typical example of indirect cost is administrative expenses. The indirect labor costs are the salaries a manufacturing company pays to payroll staff, administrative assistants, sales team members, and office managers. These costs are indirect because they are not directly linked to the products you manufacture but are part of the company’s overhead and relate to the entire business. Indirect costs also include rent, depreciation, insurance, and quality control. But you must recognize that these costs are unnecessary if they don’t directly contribute to the manufacturing process. Such expenses are required to ensure the business runs successfully. Any opportunity costs are also considered indirect. It is the money that your company loses because of performance issues. How to calculate manufacturing labor costs Now that you understand the direct and indirect labor costs, here’s how to calculate labor costs in manufacturing. There are three significant aspects. 1. Calculate the hourly labor rate Calculating the direct hourly labor rate is the sum of all the wages, taxes, and other cost benefits for a given period divided by the number of work hours for that given period. The hourly labor rate is calculated as follows: Wages + taxes + other benefits / Number of hours worked during the pay period 2. Calculate labor hours It is the calculation of the labor hours put into producing one unit of your product. It is one of the essential metrics to calculate the labor cost in manufacturing. Divide the number of units produced by the labor hours required to make the units. The formula for labor hours is: Units produced / labor hours needed to make the units 3. Calculate labor cost per unit The labor cost per unit is the multiplication of the hourly labor rate by the labor hours per unit. Once you have calculated the hourly labor rate and labor hours, you can calculate labor cost per unit as: Labor hourly rate x labor hours The final labor cost per unit will help you establish how much portion of the overall expenditure is attributed to the labor cost in manufacturing. Based on the outcome, you can implement one of the following ways to reduce the manufacturing labor cost . How to reduce manufacturing labor costs 1. Track employee work hours Employee work hours tracking errors can have costly ramifications for the manufacturing business. You will be paying for the hours workers did not work. This is why you must ditch the traditional paper sign-in or punching clocks and invest in modern employee time and attendance management systems like Truein. Truein is a cloud-based, hardware-less employee time-tracking system that ensures no overpayment. It can track workers in the manufacturing unit using its geofencing and GPS tracking features.

Keep overtime to a minimum Overtime is a significant revenue killer for manufacturing companies. If you rely on a small number of workers, you will pay some workers overtime which is almost twice their regular wages. Also, other workers will remain under-utilized. Truein can help with overtime calculation and shift scheduling such that work is proportionately among the workers and overtime is minimized.

It is essential to check the labor cost to keep the business profitable, employees satisfied, and revenues flowing in. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

It is essential to keep the productivity in manufacturing high because it affects costs and profitability and is critical to remain competitive. You should take all the necessary steps to get a competitive edge. This article will entail tips on how to increase productivity in manufacturing, but before that, let’s find out how manufacturing productivity is calculated. Table of Contents How to calculate productivity in manufacturing industry Six ways to improve productivity & efficiency in manufacturing 1. Check what problem your workers are facing 2. Train your employees 3. Increase communication within and outside the company 4. Maintain the machines properly 5. Schedule shifts of employees 6. Automate the manufacturing process Conclusion How to calculate productivity in manufacturing industry Manufacturing productivity is the simple ratio of output to input. It is a simple calculation of how much throughput or quantity you produce compared to the amount of input. The input of a manufacturing company includes labor, overtime, capital resources, natural resources, and other costs. The output is simply the number of goods produced. You can calculate manufacturing productivity as follows: Manufacturing productivity = Output / Input For instance, if your company produces $10,000,000 worth of products in a month by employees putting in 5,000 hours, your company’s manufacturing productivity will be: Manufacturing productivity = 10,000,000 / 5,000 hours = $2,000/hour. However, this value does not equal profit as you have to consider wages, overheads, and other costs. We have kept the calculation simple to be able to understand the productivity level of the company. To truly improve manufacturing productivity, you must consider the following tips. Six ways to improve productivity & efficiency in manufacturing 1. Check what problem your workers are facing The workers are at the center of manufacturing productivity, and project managers should begin by assessing the workforce. You need to understand the problems workers are facing that are reducing their productivity. First, you have to establish that you have the right people working in the teams so that they can properly utilize the available resources and tools. Next, evaluate existing workflow processes to determine how they can be improved. If there are any roadblocks in the process, ask for feedback from workers so you can plan a remedy. Also, you should explore the available technologies and equipment that can help workers improve their productivity with minimum effort. These changes will affect manufacturing productivity positively. You can also have regular discussions with workers on improving manufacturing productivity. Workers on the floor handling machinery and equipment know better what’s not working. To enhance productivity in the long term, it is essential to engage workers during the planning phase. 2. Train your employees If you find that workers lack essential skills, then it is vital to invest in training employees. Companies can improve manufacturing efficiency by implementing a training program to ensure proper coordination of workers and processes. Industry experts agree that employee training is the cornerstone of every productivity strategy. Manufacturing companies should prioritize regular training and maintain detailed training logs of workers. To improve employee efficiency, as a manager, you can set up a personalized schedule for employees to track their progress over time. If you install any new equipment, plan for dedicated training of employees. You should provide employees with additional industry resources and online tools that allow them to learn independently. This is important to set up a team that’s proactively learning to improve efficiency and problem-solving capabilities. A manufacturing industry survey found that a 10% increase in workforce education leads to a productivity boost of 8.6% . 3. Increase communication within and outside the company Improvement of manufacturing productivity also depends on how efficient the communication is with the workers, key suppliers, vendors, and partners. The supply chain is an intricate part of the manufacturing process, so collaboration with suppliers and customer response time should be fast. You can use several tools to improve communication within and outside the company. An ERP can help you maintain open communication with all the stakeholders by offering a constant flow of real-time data. You can track and monitor workers’ performance, supply chains, and operations. With an ERP, you can watch the entire process from procurement to production to distribution which will help you make better decisions. When all the data is available within your dashboard, you can quickly identify shortages or performance issues hindering manufacturing productivity. 4. Maintain the machines properly If your organization is not regularly inspecting tools for efficiency, productivity may lapse. It is surprising to see how many managers look for ways to improve operational efficiency in manufacturing violence while neglecting the machines’ essential maintenance. In manufacturing, this is considered a cardinal sin. We understand that maintenance schedules are inconvenient as they cost time and money, but in the long term, they are an essential part of keeping operations active and equipment safe for workers. Also, companies should keep exploring new and better tools for the job to improve productivity without increasing work hours. Train your staff to keep an eye out for what’s happening with each machine. Maintenance schedules should be consistently maintained. And you should keep spare parts, cables, and other components available for immediate replacement if things break down. Time lost due to breakdowns is one of the main contributors to reduced manufacturing productivity. 5. Schedule shifts of employees Shift scheduling in manufacturing can improve productivity by ensuring that the correct number of workers are on hand to handle the workload at any given time. This can reduce workers’ idle time, which can increase overall efficiency and productivity. Additionally, well-designed shift schedules can help reduce absenteeism and turnover, which can also positively impact productivity. Advanced scheduling software like Truein can make it easier to create and manage shift schedules, further improving efficiency.

Machinery and other equipment bring a certain level of automation, but it’s not enough to replace workers. Without workers, there is no manufacturing, so managers should always pay attention to manufacturing shift schedules. When managing a manufacturing unit, your attention might be divided across the entire manufacturing process, but the primary focus must be on employees. While manufacturing shift scheduling can be tricky, there are some ways to make the whole process simpler. This article will discuss various manufacturing shift patterns and how you can choose the best schedule type for your company. Table of Contents Types and examples of manufacturing shift schedules 1. Rotating shifts 2. DuPont shifts 3. 2-3-2 shifts 4. 4 on 4 off shifts How to pick the proper schedule for your team? 1. See what shift pattern fits your business needs 2. See when you need more workers 3. Please communicate with your employees before assigning any shift and know their preference Best practices to assign shifts with ease 1. Use an automated software 2. Plan the shifts in advance 3. Stay compliant with the local and state rules Conclusion Types and examples of manufacturing shift schedules Understanding the kind of manufacturing shift schedules that most companies implement can help you make a calculated decision. While the best shift schedule model will depend on factors such as workforce size, business needs, and preferences, here are the most common manufacturing shift patterns you must know about. 1. Rotating shifts It’s the literal definition of how this manufacturing shift schedule is. The rotating shift patterns require employees regularly switch between day and night shifts. With rotating shifts , companies can maintain 24/7 operations with fewer workers. For instance, a team can work day shifts for one week while the other works the night shift. The following week, the teams will exchange shifts before returning to their respective shifts. Rotating shifts are standard manufacturing work schedules at companies requiring consistent production without a complex workforce management system. 2. DuPont shifts While rotating manufacturing shift schedules are simple to maintain, they disturb the sleeping pattern of the workers as shift changes are too frequent to get used to. A better alternative is the DuPont manufacturing shift pattern that follows a four-week cycle that uses a 12-hour rotating shift. In this manufacturing shift schedule, you have to divide your workforce into four teams, each switching between day and night shifts with days off between shifts. The main benefit of maintaining such a schedule is that workers in each group get a seven days consecutive break every month. However, for the DuPont rotating shift pattern, you will require four teams, and skilled workers should be in each group. This will require several skilled workers who work longer shifts without much break. 3. 2-3-2 shifts The 2-3-2 work schedule is also known as the Pitman schedule, which is more straightforward than DuPont rotating manufacturing work schedule. It also requires four teams, each team working on a rotating schedule over four weeks. However, the working days are not continuous. The workers work the first two days, then two days off, followed by three days of work, two offs, two working days, and three days off. This is a pattern that is followed for both day and night shifts. As the 2-3-2 shift runs over four weeks, consistency helps workers get used to the rotating shift schedule. But, it can be tiring for workers due to 3 consecutive 12-hour shifts. 4. 4 on 4 off shifts 4 on 4 off manufacturing shift schedules can be implemented at companies that require round-the-clock coverage. While it can be implemented in several patterns, the most common are: 4 days working 4 days off 4 nights working 4 days off This work schedule’s drawback is that workers must work on weekends. However, in the manufacturing industry, workers work weekends in most shift patterns. A significant benefit of 4-on-4 manufacturing shift patterns is that your workers get four days of workweeks with four days off at a time to get enough rest. How to pick the proper schedule for your team? The manufacturing shift schedules we listed might seem more or less the same, but there is a significant difference in how they are implemented and affect workers’ productivity. To increase productivity and efficiency in a manufacturing company you should ensure that workers are well-rested and you have to make a wise decision when choosing a shift schedule. Effective employee scheduling is beneficial for both employers and employees. While workers get to maintain a healthy work-life balance, employers can maintain consistent productivity. To make the decision, you must know your company goals, budget, and workforce strength. Here is what you need to know. 1. See what shift pattern fits your business needs Every shift schedule has its prerequisites. You have to explore the requirements of your organization in depth. Understand whether your company needs to operate 24/7 to meet customers’ requirements in the market. Are there any offs in the manufacturing process currently? What skills do you require in the workers on each shift? It would help if you answer these essential questions to decide which shift pattern fits your business requirements. 2. See when you need more workers Different manufacturing units have other demands, and only some days of the year they do need to operate around the clock. Similarly, you will require more workers during some business hours than the rest. Such as if you need to move inventory earlier in the day. You must know when your company’s demand for products and workers is high. See what changes you can make to the staffing demands and which manufacturing shift schedule is most suitable according to the work demands in each shift. 3. Please communicate with your employees before assigning any shift and know their preference Never impose the new manufacturing work schedule on your workers. Instead, it would help if you communicated the changes with them openly. Your plan must provide a healthy balance between work and personal life. This is important to maintain high employee satisfaction and retention. Currently, 80% of salaried manufacturing workers want their employers to provide more flexible work models. You should always introduce flexibility and seek employee feedback about the new work schedule before you make it live. Best practices to assign shifts with ease 1. Use an automated software Reading through this guide, manufacturing shift scheduling might seem simple, but things can get tricky when you have hundreds of workers to schedule. Managers must have automated software like Truein to help them with shift scheduling. Truein is a comprehensive cloud-based employee time and attendance management software that also features shift scheduling. It is a hardware-less solution that can be easily implemented in the manufacturing industry. Managers can create and share rotating shift schedules through the dashboard. Schedule a demo today and see how Truein can help to make manufacturing shift scheduling simple and robust. 2. Plan the shifts in advance Your workers will not appreciate sudden changes in their work schedules. This is why managers must take cognizance of the shift changes in advance to introduce changes gradually. It is also essential to check staff availability before creating a new manufacturing work schedule. 3. Stay compliant with the local and state rules Finally, your manufacturing shift schedules must follow the guidelines of local and state laws regarding work shifts and overtime. It is critical to comply with the rules to create a sustainable shift schedule. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion In the manufacturing industry, efficient workforce management is essential for productivity and profitability.

Suppose your organization is experiencing an above-average attrition rate. In that case, if you are dealing with a disturbed productivity rate or it is challenging to take control of the working conditions, you need to act fast. To orchestrate resource utilization so that your company reaches its productivity targets without overburdening the workers, you have two use workforce management (WFM) and workforce optimization (WFO). WFO and WFM are the concepts that use statistical analysis to recommend the most effective mix of resources, including workers, to ensure high productivity and job satisfaction among the workforce. Both terms are often used interchangeably, but there lie subtle differences between the two concepts. Understanding workforce management vs. workforce optimization differences can help you make the most of the available resources in the long term. Table of Contents What is workforce management? What is workforce optimization? Workforce Management vs. Workforce Optimization: 4 Key Differences 3 Benefits of implementing WFM and WFO 1. Build a happier and more efficient workforce 2. Increases your company's agility 3. Cost savings Conclusion What is workforce management? Workforce management, or WFM , is a set of strategies, processes, and tools that the management uses to increase worker productivity. It primarily targets manpower forecasting , scheduling, and shift management through tools to automate the process. The main objective of workforce management is to ensure that the organization is adequately staffed. Furthermore, it also provides a contingent workforce available to address the productivity requirements at peak periods. Workforce management addresses the requirements of shift scheduling and refining the work environment to allow employees to work in a conducive environment. WFM uses tools to help managers create schedules, assign shifts to the workers, create reports, and monitor day-to-day activities within the company. Truein is a cloud-based hardware-less employee time and attendance management application that offers WFM features like shift schedule creation, attendance tracking, monitoring the location of employees at work, auto-generating reports, overtime management, and more. What is workforce optimization? Workforce optimization or WFO refers to the set of processes, strategies, and tools that help individual worker increase their productivity, quality, efficiency, and sustainability in the long term. Simply put, WFO emphasizes talent development and quality assurance at the employee level within the workforce. As opposed to WFM, which deals with the day-to-day productivity of the entire company, WFO offers high-level insights into overtime, disengagement among workers, stress levels, or too many idle hours within the workforce. WFO utilizes scheduling tools the same as workforce management, but it also requires monitoring the workers’ quality and performance to provide further training for upskilling. Workforce Management vs. Workforce Optimization: 4 Key Differences WFO also includes learning and development as part of the strategy, while WFM does not emphasize learning or development. This can also be highlighted as the key difference of workforce optimization and workforce management. Only workforce optimization provides real-time skill development tips, recording-based guidance, and other talent development aids for improving the workers at the individual level. WFM works on the scheduling and availability of the workers, while WFO focuses on efficiency gains within the individual workers. Workforce Management allows companies to standardize service levels and other important KPIs to ensure that all business processes run smoothly and face no workforce shortage. On the other hand, workforce optimization unlocks new efficiencies and opportunities through performance analytics and long-term training of the workers. Workforce optimization strategies include workforce management features, but not the other way around. WFM is a necessary part of WFO, so at some companies, workforce optimization alone is enough to improve productivity. However, standalone WFM lacks vital features of WFO, such as performance monitoring, employee engagement, and skill development management. For a small company, workforce management alone would suffice if their requirements were not complex. However, such essential forecasting and scheduling capabilities must be improved for medium-scale and large organizations. Organizations with large teams must utilize both WFM and WFO to have different strategies for managing quality assurance, performance, and productivity. 3 Benefits of implementing WFM and WFO At your organization, depending on the size of the workforce, you can choose to implement either workforce management or workforce optimization. WFO implementation probably works best because it also includes WFM features by default. 1. Build a happier and more efficient workforce With WFO, you can engage employees and help them improve their talent, which results in increased output and higher satisfaction at work. Managed and streamlined workforce is happier and more efficient. 2. Increases your company's agility With WFM and WFO, you can scale up work depending on the market’s demands. This makes your company more agile, and you can easily meet budget constraints or quickly react to project needs. 3. Cost savings Proper workforce management and optimization present many cost-saving opportunities. The key benefits include lower payroll costs, flexibility in talent acquisition, and reduced compliance risks. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion We hope our workforce management vs. workforce optimization explanation has provided you with enough information to use the terms interchangeably next time.

These policies are different from employment policies because they apply when the services of a worker are terminated rather than when the employee starts working for the company. The managers and employees must adequately understand the termination policies, and you must know how they can affect your business and the relationship with the workforce. Table of Contents What is employee termination? 4 Types of Employee Termination 1. Voluntary Termination 2. Involuntary Termination 3. Employment at Will 4. Mutual Termination Labor law or termination rules for employees in India Labor law or termination rules for employees in US Labor law or termination rules for employees in UAE Employee termination policy template Employee termination policy template Things to consider for proper employee termination Can employers terminate employees without giving a reason at any time? Conclusion What is employee termination? Employee termination is simply the dismissal of an employee’s employment contract by the employer. Employee termination policy and procedures vary from company to company, but typically it’s done when the employer determines that the services of an employee are no longer needed. However, it can also happen if the employee breaches their employment contract. If the employer retires an old worker by dismissing them without cause or offering them an early retirement, it is also referred to as employee termination. In this scenario, employees are often laid off, termed job loss, or fired for dismissal without cause. Legally, an employer must provide notice before terminating the employment of a worker, exception for involuntary terminations due to downsizing or economic hardship. Employee termination is necessary to keep workers straight and narrow. It also provides some ground rules for the employees to follow and for the employers to avoid legal entanglements by the former employees. 4 Types of Employee Termination A well thought and comprehensive employee termination policy will list different types of terminations. The most common types of employee termination are: 1. Voluntary Termination As the title suggests, this is the type of termination that workers take on their own and leave the company voluntarily. There can be several professional and personal reasons why an employee might choose voluntary termination. It can include a lack of growth opportunities, personal problems, a toxic work environment, and no employee development. If your organization has high voluntary termination, you may be at fault, and you must proactively take steps to correct the situation for the remaining workers. 2. Involuntary Termination Involuntary termination is when an employer removes an employee from employment for some reason. Low performance, violation of company rules, and acceptable employee behavior can be why a company can choose involuntary termination of the employee. This type of termination can also result as the outcome of employee disciplinary action. 3. Employment at Will This type of employee termination gives the employer the right to fire a worker anywhere at any place without any reason. Employment at will allows an employer to terminate the employment contract without giving any reason. However, workers can still fight or prohibit such termination if they feel there is some discrimination. 4. Mutual Termination Here, both parties agreed to employee termination without any objections. Often, mutual termination is the best option as it’s a lot less messy, and there are minimal legal hassles. Apart from these types of employee termination, there can be other types depending on the nature of your business and the company’s size. It is essential to mention the kind in the employee termination policy of the company to inform workers better. Labor law or termination rules for employees in India In India, employee termination has some important rules that employees must follow. Firstly, the organization must offer a notice period of 30 to 90 days. Also, according to the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 , when terminating more than a hundred employees in a manufacturing plant, mine, or plantation unit, government approval must be sought. In other sectors, only notifying the government is enough. Under Indian labor laws, employees can be terminated for one of the following reasons: Disobedience or will full insubordination Fraud, Dishonesty, or Theft Wilfully damaging employer’s property Taking bribes/illegal gratifications Absence without applying for leave for more than 10 days Late Attendance Indiscipline at the workplace Negligence of work You cannot fire an employee who is pregnant or seeking maternity leave under the Maternity Benefit Act of 2017 in the Indian constitution. In the employee termination policy, non-solicitation clauses can be used in a limited fashion, but non-compete agreements cannot be enforced according to Indian law u nless the employer contractually agrees. Labor law or termination rules for employees in US In the United States, most employment is treated as ‘at will.’ It means that both the employer and employees have the legal right to terminate employment without advance notice or procedures. However, under federal, state, or local law, an employer cannot terminate an employee, even at will for any unlawful reason. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ( the WARN Act ) governs the mass layoff at any company within the United States. According to the act, an employer laying off 100 or more employees must provide the termination notice 60 days in advance. Labor law or termination rules for employees in UAE Employee termination policy template In UAE, your employee termination policy must be by Article 43 (1) of the Employment Law : “Either party to an Employment Contract may terminate the contract for a good cause, by giving the other a notice in writing. The employee shall perform his duties during the notice period agreed upon in the contract, provided that the notice period is not less than 30 days and not over 90 days.” Employee termination policy template If you need to be made aware of how to create a comprehensive employee termination policy, you can use the shared employee termination policy template. It is essential to include the purpose, procedures, and final pay rules in detail within the employee termination policy. Check out a sample employee termination policy template here . Things to consider for proper employee termination Evaluating the terms and conditions governing the employment termination policy and procedures is crucial. Here’s what you need to consider to avoid unnecessary lawsuits or further retaliation from former employees. 1. Provide a notice period: It is illegal to fire an employee without warning. A 30 to 90 days notice period must be served before terminating an employee. Also, you must provide a notice mentioning the reason for employee termination. If you fail to provide timely notice to an employee before their termination, they can file a lawsuit against the company. 2. Severance pay: It is the pay that an employee receives as compensation from the employer if the termination is reached with mutual consensus, retirement, layoffs, or employees leaving the company for reasons other than dismissal by misconduct. Severance pay is a highly effective tool to encourage mutual employee termination. 3. Know industry-specific employee termination requirements: There can be additional requirements for valid employee termination policies and procedures. You must know the legal requirements for employee termination within your industry. For instance, in mass terminations in factories, mines, or plantations employing more than 100 employees, the employer must give at least three months of wages as severance to the workers who are proposed to be terminated. 4. Avoid constructive dismissal: A constructive dismissal is a situation created by employers who wilfully force employees to quit even when they don’t want to. The resignation can result from bad working conditions or a change in employment, leaving workers with no choice but to quit. Some common factors that can amount to constructive dismissal are: Reduction in salary A demotion Transfer to a less desirable position Harassment or humiliation by the management Early retirement offers Indirect threats of termination 5. Conduct an exit interview: Exit interviews with an employee who leaves the organization for any reason can benefit the company. Planned exit interviews provide management with important information about the working environment, culture, workforce Management, and the development of the employees. Can employers terminate employees without giving a reason at any time? Not, really. Sharing the termination policy with the employment contract during the hiring process is essential. And if you’re an employee, you must always ask for the termination policy before accepting the employment to avoid any unpleasant surprises later. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion Employee termination is a complicated procedure code for employers and employees.

How To Hire and Manage Contract Employees Easily? May 28, 2024 Contract employees provide significant cost savings for companies and help maintain a lean workforce. Organizations can use a contractual workforce for their specific needs to solve a problem without paying any excess overhead. You have the freedom since you will be paying only for the services you get. However, many companies still don’t feel confident about hiring a contractual workforce because they do not know how to manage contract employees. In this article, we will share some essential tips on how to hire and manage contract staff. Table of Contents 5. Tips for hiring and managing contract employees 1. Start by posting a job 2. Describe the project clearly 3. Improve the contract employee experience 4. Set and share milestones and goals clearly, along with the timeline 5. Monitor work progress and share your review 6. Communicate with them Truein can help manage contract workers Conclusion 5. Tips for hiring and managing contract employees 1. Start by posting a job Consider posting remote contract jobs to attract top talent for your contract positions. A detailed job description outlining responsibilities, skills, and qualifications will attract suitable candidates who prefer working remotely. Remote work options open up a global talent pool, enabling you to access skilled professionals regardless of their location. Utilize specialized remote job platforms to reach a wider audience and find the perfect fit for your contract roles. 2. Describe the project clearly A common concern among employers is whether contract workers will work the same as full-time workers. The easiest way to ensure your contract staff does what needs to be done is to provide them with clear instructions about the requirement according to the scope of work. Provide the job details, the number of workers you will need, job schedules, which skilled laborers are required, and other important information about the job such that there is no scope for any confusion. 3. Improve the contract employee experience Most employers worry about the engagement of contract staff. It is true that contract laborers are not full-time employees but they also have pay expectations. It might be true to an extent that they are not directly under your supervision, but there are ways to engage them. When you proactively recognize the work done by contract workers, it gives them a sense of belonging, and they start caring more about their performance. Simple things like appreciating the good work, providing training to workers proactively, and acknowledging their accomplishments make them feel like part of the company. Contract workers must be treated with respect and administration at the same level as full-time employees. This motivates them and keeps them engaged to deliver the best. 4. Set and share milestones and goals clearly, along with the timeline Another way to manage contract employees is to discuss the project’s goals and milestones before allocating a job to them. Just informing them about their duties is not enough; you have to help them create a roadmap for the goals by telling them about the timelines. This ensures future understanding of the priority of the tasks. It is essential to provide extra supervision and training to contract workers at the start of the project to make them understand the work. Clearly inform the workers how their employment will be affected if they do not stick to the deadlines and deliver work daily. Keep contract workers from guessing deadlines and let them know about penalties for delaying work or not meeting the agreed deadlines. 5. Monitor work progress and share your review It can be challenging to decide how managers will monitor the attendance of contract workers and the work progress. You have to look beyond just describing what tasks laborers must finish and at what time. There is more to contract worker supervision like you have to schedule the workers, check if overtime is required and if the work is getting delivered on time. After that, you must share transparent reviews about the performance of the workers to their contractors, but try to be more constructive with the criticism. Instead, tell contractors how they can make the workers work more efficiently. 6. Communicate with them It is essential to keep contract workers within the communication loop so they understand what’s happening around them. It is important to remind them by writing or giving notice, doing on-site visits, or through their contractors that their work is essential for the overall project. This will convey your concern and show that, as a manager, you are vigilant about their contribution and evaluation of their work. As contractors may have a large number of workers under them, the roster changes frequently. A worker working today might not be available tomorrow and henceforth. Continuous communication and feedback are necessary to ensure that contractors are aware of how the overall workforce is performing irrespective of changes in the roster.

It involves careful consideration and planning as it is affected by both internal and external factors. As a manager, you will be tasked with workforce management decisions. It will involve specifying the number of available workers and will be required to carry out business operations optimally. To be able to devise a plan to increase or decrease manpower sustainably requires forecasting. It helps companies use the available resources to the fullest by identifying and reorganizing the team workers to improve productivity. In this article, we will explore manpower forecasting in human resource planning. Table of Contents What is manpower forecasting? Why manpower forecasting is needed? Different methods of manpower forecasting 1. Work-load analysis 2. Workforce analysis Conclusion What is manpower forecasting? Manpower forecasting helps prevent shortages of workers and laborers within the company by accessing the current workforce levels. It also helps quantify how many people and positions can be expected soon. With systematic manpower forecasting, businesses can meet the human resource requirements of future business challenges. This is why manpower forecasting is critical to meet your organization’s business goals. When a company fails to forecast manpower needs, there can be a severe gestational lag in the workforce. It can exist at any level of manpower. For example, if you are in the manufacturing industry, you will need skilled machinists who can operate CNC machines. Suppose there is an upcoming surge in production to meet the increased customer demand, but there is no manpower forecasting. How will you anticipate or prepare your workers to meet the increased production demand? Manpower forecasting facilities design skilling programs for the workers to ensure no gap in the workforce. This is how you can maintain the correct quantity and quality of manpower as and when required. At the organizational level, the absence of manpower forecasting can result in acute understaffing or underutilization of highly skilled workers in the company. Why manpower forecasting is needed? Manpower forecasting is essential to maintain the correct headcount per the company’s requirements and objectives. Foremost, you require manpower forecasting to anticipate the need for increased labor to maintain optimal productivity within the company. Another important reason why manpower forecasting in human resource planning is critical is to maintain the pool of skilled workers. For instance, if your manufacturing unit has installed machinery that requires providing operators with specialized training, you must start using such machines for production before you can begin using such machines for production. You will need trained workers to operate the machines to keep production optimal. With manpower forecasting, you can facilitate training planning well in advance. It is the only way to ensure that required manpower, both in terms of quality and quantities, is available when you need it. The labor market fluctuation is another reason manpower planning and forecasting are essential for businesses. A recent example is how the COVID-19 pandemic spooked the labor market, resulting in large-scale unemployment and a shortage of available labor. There was a large gap between the demand and supply in the labor market. To mitigate such workforce risks, the human resource must plan the supply of workers to meet the demand as it arises. Manpower planning and forecasting ensure that you always have a poll of skilled labor to support production and protect your revenues against labor market distortions. Another reason for manpower forecasting is in the short run, where you have to anticipate upskilling existing workers to support the production of goods and services. It is often required when companies choose to upgrade existing technological infrastructure. There arises a need to train workers to avoid skill shortages. Manpower forecasting can help companies stay afloat, such as upskilling requirements. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Different methods of manpower forecasting Simply put, manpower forecasting is the process of estimating future human resource requirements. As mentioned before, manpower forecasting in human resource planning can be affected by internal and external factors; you must use the correct methods of manpower forecasting suitable for your organization. Here are the most common methods of manpower forecasting: 1. Work-load analysis It is a suitable method of manpower forecasting for industries where the workload can be easily measured, such as construction, mining, and manufacturing. Workload analysis involves a set of processes to calculate the workload of a position, sub-position, and the number of workers required to fill the position and sub-position. Suppose a company has an estimated production of 1 50,000 units, and it takes two man hours to produce each unit. Also, the previously calculated workability of each employee is 1500 man-hours per annum. Workload analysis can be used to calculate the demand for human resources as follows: Estimated total annual production = 1, 50,000 units Standard man-hours required to produce each unit = 2 hrs Estimated man-hours needed to meet production goal (1,50,000 x 2) = 300000 hrs Workability/contribution per employee = 1500 units Estimated no. of workers needed = 3,00,000/1500 = 200 The example shows that the company will require 200 workers in a year to maintain the production level of 1 50,000 units. This is a simple example. Workload analysis also considers other factors like absenteeism rate, rate of labor turnover, machine breakdown, strikes, power failure, etc. 2. Workforce analysis Workforce analysis makes the foundation for manpower planning and forecasting. It determines the rate of influx and outflow of employees. It also provides a sufficient margin for labor turnover, absenteeism, and idle time to make accurate workforce forecasts to meet production requirements. For data, workforce analysis relies on tools that record overtime, leaves, and absenteeism. Truein is a robust manpower attendance management tool with advanced leave, absence, overtime, and shift scheduling capabilities. As a hardware-less, cloud-based employee time and attendance application , it can be deployed at any business unit; be it manufacturing, construction, mining, etc. Schedule a free demo today and see how it can help to automate attendance management in your organization. Conclusion Manpower forecasting is an efficient way to anticipate future human resource demands by utilizing past data. It provides an exact approximation of the expected changes in the workforce demands to understand the possible changes in manpower clearly. Forecasting manpower needs give businesses the ability to cope with emerging challenges. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

In the past, companies focused more on revenue, competition, and economic instability. However, human resource management is more important today to keep skilled workers and talent, which is necessary for competitive advantage. Human resource management problems and solutions revolve around people because they are the most critical asset for a company and have the power to influence its growth and sustainability. HRM involves several responsibilities, from workforce recruitment to continual training and development and legal compliance. There are numerous challenges of HRM in India that expand over three domains. These can be environmental such as the economy and legal compliances, organizational life restructuring, competition, and management change, and individuals that can include work ethics, growth, and empowerment. This article highlights some major human resource management problems and solutions you must know as a manager. Table of Contents Eight human resource management problems and solutions 1. Compliance with laws and regulations 2. Health and safety of staff 3. Building leadership within the team 4. Attracting and retaining top talents 5. Providing compensation and benefits to staff 6. Adding diversity in the workplace 7. Creating a value-oriented company culture 8. Monitoring productivity and performance of staff Conclusion Eight human resource management problems and solutions 1. Compliance with laws and regulations The countries are amending Labour laws to be more employee-friendly. This is becoming a challenge for organizations, especially small and medium enterprises, as they need more resources to keep pace with such regulatory changes. This is because smaller companies don’t usually have focused departments for HR that can update the company employment policies by changing laws. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can make your organization liable for a lawsuit. The compliance laws and regulations are not only related to hiring practices but are also associated with staff benefits, payments, overtime, and other aspects of employment. Understanding these acts and legislation can be difficult for managers because the correct interpretation is necessary for adherence. An easy solution to this HRM problem is to hire statutory compliance agencies. It saves time, and you receive expert opinions and consultation on all the policies and guidelines that are a must for your industry. This convenience comes at a cost, but it’s a small price to pay compared to the risks of non-compliance and the threat to your brand image. 2. Health and safety of staff Similar to laws and regulations, it is human resources’ responsibility to ensure the workers’ health and safety within the company. The challenge is creating and enforcing health and safety processes within the organization. Your organization must have employee training programs to help them understand the health and safety measures necessary for the role. In an industry such as mining, manufacturing, or construction, tracking workplace injuries or safety violations becomes a challenge due to the extensive work area. The solution is to create a designated health and safety committee within your organization. If you are a small or medium-scale enterprise, you can assign a single person to that role. You must provide tools and training to the workers so that they understand local health and safety laws. You must empower them to change, upgrade or even shut down operations in case of an accident or injury. For any company, the health and safety of the workers should be a top priority. 3. Building leadership within the team When you’re too focused on creating resources and training tools for the staff, it is easy to overlook the need for grooming leaders within the workforce. A common misconception that hinders the growth and success of organizations is that leaders do not need to learn more; even if they do, it can be achieved through self-learning. Leaders are essential in influencing the organizational structure and deciding staff satisfaction. You will face frequent employer and employee conflicts if you lack leadership grooming. Such disagreements result in an unhealthy work environment, adversely affecting the morale and productivity of your workers. The solution lies in creating a learning and development strategy targeting employees at all levels within the organizational chart. It is essential that leaders are trained, mentored, and guided by mentors within the management. You can also create human resource management challenges and solution PDFs and share them with prospective leaders. While future leaders can learn technical aspects independently, soft skills like having difficult conversations, conducting meetings, and providing developmental feedback require experience, mentoring, and exposure. You mustn’t lose leaders to organizational growth and provide them with an environment to grow in their roles. 4. Attracting and retaining top talents Competition is one of the essential factors that must be kept into consideration when planning HR strategies. It is even more pressing for small and medium companies because hiring and retaining skilled workers is difficult when they compete with big names and brands. Recruitment is challenging, but retention is only possible if you are providing staff with the correct benefits, opportunities, exposure, and a positive work environment. Attracting and retaining top talent is one of the most significant challenges of HRM in India. The solution is to create a strong employer brand to attract top talent into your organization. Employees can do background checks on the company and understand their employer’s value easily by connecting with other workers from the same company through social media. Having a strong positive brand presence on these platforms works in your favor. An easy way to show prospective staff you care is by being active in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). These activities are a privilege for your organization to give back to society and act as the emotional platform for employee and employer bonding. Furthermore, the onboarding process at the company should be smooth, and new workers should have a leisurely experience working in the new work environment. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 5. Providing compensation and benefits to staff The competition in the corporate world makes it difficult for organizations to keep up with the compensation and benefits offered. Large companies can provide significant compensation and benefits to the workers, but it is a challenge for HRM at small and medium enterprises to keep up with the offering. This makes recruitment and retention extremely difficult. The increased cost of hiring also includes taxes, human capital investments, and training charges. Such an item of expenditure can be a threat to your company’s progress and success. If you cannot offer high compensation like your competition, you can still be a strong contender by offering attractive benefits. You can offer variable and performance-based components to the staff. This will encourage them to perform better. Also, you can start substantial reward and recognition programs to attract performance. Also, organizations can choose to increase healthcare costs to offer family benefits to the workers. Smaller organizations can offer flexible benefits such as extended vacation time, flexible timings, well-being programs, and transportation benefits. 6. Adding diversity in the workplace Having diversity in the workforce is a boon for any organization. Bringing people from diverse cultures and ethnicities enhances your organization’s problem-solving capability and innovation. However, for human resource management, this also brings challenges related to diversity in age, gender, nationality, culture, etc. It is a great challenge to cater to the unique requirements of the workers dependent on their age, gender, or ethnicity. As a manager, maintaining employee engagement while fostering effective communication when workers from different backgrounds work together is difficult because employee disagreements are much more frequent. To resolve conflicts arising due to diversity, human resource management must make arrangements to sensitize all staff to respect and show compassion towards the culture of other people they are working with. You can make culture orientation part of the onboarding process within your company. Your organization’s values and work culture should prioritize respecting each other’s culture and beliefs. Teambuilding activities help align employees with integrating different cultures and backgrounds. You can set a standard of behavior within the workplace so workers are aware of what is expected from their conduct and behavior. It’s essential to have a company culture that is welcoming and comfortable. 7. Creating a value-oriented company culture The company culture is critical to dealing with human resource management problems and solutions in the long run. The modern workforce expects to work for a company that has healthy work culture. They emphasized proper work/life balance over salary and benefits. If you need to create a value-oriented company culture, you risk losing a skilled workforce to the competition. The most effective way to create a value-oriented work environment is to empower your workers through recognition, incentives, and power. You benefit your employer brand by allowing workers to grow by encouraging them to adhere to the company’s values. This is one of India’s most significant challenges in human resource management. Still, you can easily deal with it by encouraging staff to work on what interests them apart from the responsibilities mentioned in their job description. 8. Monitoring productivity and performance of staff Productivity and performance within the company are shared responsibilities between human resource management and managers. As a manager, you are ultimately responsible for your team’s performance. However, if your team is not performing or its productivity is low, it is the HRM’s responsibility to make tough decisions regarding your team. In such a scenario, several human resource management problems arise. They have to decide how to monitor the performance and productivity levels of the workers to ensure that business operation is at an optimum level. Identifying the root cause of low performance requires cross-functionally verifying the reasons with managers and workers. It can be challenging to report human resource issues to the executive team for strategic decisions without proper monitoring of the productivity and performance of the workers. To monitor productivity and performance, key indicators need to be monitored so that you have two ensure that you don’t come too strong, making workers feel uncomfortable due to continuous monitoring. The potential solutions include using HR platforms to integrate performance management, goal management, and performance tracking. You must study the teams achieving their goals to understand what they’re doing right and then incorporate those findings for other groups. Also, you must keep the lines of communication open for all the managers to report any issues or challenges they face before things get worse.
