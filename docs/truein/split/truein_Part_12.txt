Home Truein Help and Support General Support What different attendance modes are available in Truein? What different attendance modes are available in Truein? Truein provides multiple modes to capture attendance in the kiosk device. You can set up any of the modes below based on your organization’s needs. Auto In-Out Mode: When this mode is set, a staff member’s first face scan will be marked as IN, and the next face scan will be marked as OUT. The system will mark OUT only when the next face scan is after 5 minutes. If the next face scan is done within 5 minutes, the system will consider it as Already IN. This ensures the staff member is not showing the face again by mistake when they are standing near the device. IN Mode, OUT Mode: If an organization has separate entry and exit, then they can set up a device at the entrance in IN mode and a device at the exit in OUT mode. Server Side Mode: In this mode, the admin can define the allowable hours for ‘in-time’. Any punching done outside the limits will be considered as ‘out-time’.

Home Truein Help and Support Account Setup Truein Terminology Guide Truein Terminology Guide Key Terms used in Truein Truein Terminology Description Truein Dashboard The Truein Dashboard is a web-based interface that provides administrators and authorized users with access to manage and monitor attendance and timesheet processes. It allows users to view real-time analytics, generate reports, and manage employee data Truein User App The Truein User App is a mobile application that allows staff to take attendance from their mobile devices. It is designed for employees to mark their attendance from approved worksites, such as customer sites or branches they are visiting Truein Kiosk The Truein Kiosk is a solution that allows staff to take attendance from a common device, such as a mobile or tablet, which is typically installed in a kiosk at the entrance of the office or workplace. It helps streamline the attendance process for employees, making it easier to clock in and out Site A “Site” refers to a primary location or area where staff members are assigned to work Base site In Truein, the base site refers to the primary location or site where a staff member is assigned to work. It is the main worksite associated with an employee’s attendance and activities within the system Additional Site An additional site in Truein refers to any extra location that a staff member can be assigned to, apart from their base site. This allows employees to mark attendance and perform their duties at multiple locations as needed Staff directory In Truein, the staff directory is a feature that allows you to view and manage information about all staff members within your organization. It provides access to details such as staff roles, attendance records, and the ability to add or edit staff information. You can also use the staff directory to download staff details and set up reporting hierarchies. Access level/Roles Access levels in Truein are defined based on the roles assigned to users within the organization. Truein provides out-of-the-box roles like Staff, L2 Admin, L3 Admin, Admin, and Global Admin, as well as hierarchy roles like Manager, Department Head, and Contractor Supervisor. Each role has specific permissions and access rights, which can be viewed in the “View Roles” section of the “Staff Directory.” Global admin A Global Admin in Truein is a user who has the highest level of administrative access within the organization. This role allows the user to manage all aspects of the Truein system, including user management, settings, and permissions. A Global Admin can also assign other users to the Global Admin role Shift Module Truein’s shift scheduling module simplifies shift rostering for contract and distributed teams, allowing you to create effective schedules within minutes. The staff can view any changes or updates in the shift schedule through the app. Jobs Module Jobs in Truein refer to specific work or projects that you can create and assign to your staff. This allows you to analyze the time spent on each job or project. Truein enables you to tag time against jobs or projects during attendance capturing. Know what job, activity, or client your staff is working on. Real-time dashboards give you the latest update. Geofencing location Geofencing refers to the use of GPS technology to create a virtual boundary around a specific location. This allows businesses to set rules for attendance, ensuring that employees can only mark their attendance from approved locations Activity Punch The Activity Punch feature in Truein allows staff members to indicate a specific activity or task they have performed, such as a client meeting or a visit to a vendor’s place. When a staff member performs an activity, they can do a single punch using the Activity feature, which captures the time and location of the activity. This punch does not interfere with the regular IN/OUT times of the staff member for that day. Spoofing In Truein, spoofing refers to false verification attempts where an individual uses a team member’s photo or video to mimic their facial biometrics for marking attendance. This is a security concern, and Truein has mechanisms in place to identify such spoofing activities. Regularization Regularization in Truein refers to the process of correcting or adjusting attendance records. This is typically done when there are discrepancies, such as an employee forgetting to clock in or out, or if there are errors in the recorded attendance. Employees or admins can submit regularization requests to update the attendance data to reflect the actual working hours accurately Truein Policies In Truein, policies refer to the customizable rules and guidelines that govern various aspects of attendance and time tracking for employees. These policies can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an organization and can cover areas such as: – Attendance and time tracking policies – Breaktime policies – Overtime policies – Weekly off and holiday policies Truein allows administrators to set these policies at different levels, such as by staff category, department, or shift. This flexibility helps organizations manage their workforce effectively and ensure compliance with their internal regulations Contractor Agency In Truein, a contractor agency refers to an external organization or staffing agency that provides contractual staff to a business. These agencies supply workers for various roles and help manage the workforce, especially in organizations that employ a significant number of contractual or temporary staff. This feature helps organizations maintain transparency and control over their contractual workforce Leave management Leave management in Truein refers to the system that allows organizations to manage employee leave requests, track leave balances, and generate reports related to leave. It helps streamline the process of applying for, approving, and monitoring leaves, ensuring transparency and efficiency in managing employee time off Compensatory off Compensatory off, often referred to as “comp off,” is a type of leave granted to employees who have worked extra hours or on their scheduled days off, such as weekly off or holidays. It allows employees to take time off in lieu of the extra hours they have worked, ensuring they receive appropriate rest and work-life balance Reports and Analytics Raw attendance data is instantly transformed into intuitive reports and dashboards and used to gather information about attendance patterns, staff punctuality, absence trends, and leave usage. The reports and dashboards also help achieve transparency and uncover potential solutions Forgot Out “Forgot out” in Truein refers to a situation where an employee forgets to clock out at the end of their work shift. When this happens, their attendance is marked as “forgot out.” To update this, the employee or an admin can regularize the out time Late mark A “Late mark” in Truein refers to the designation given to an employee’s attendance when they clock in after the scheduled start time of their shift. If an employee’s first In Punch is after a specified number of minutes past the regular In Time or shift grace time, it is marked as a Late Entry. This helps in tracking punctuality and managing attendance policies Early Out “Early out” in Truein refers to a situation where an employee leaves work before the scheduled end of their shift. This can be recorded in the attendance system to indicate that the employee has clocked out earlier than expected. It is important for tracking attendance and managing work hours accurately. Offline Sync Offline sync in Truein refers to the ability to record attendance even when there is no internet connection. Once the device is back online, the recorded attendance data will be synced to the system. You can check the status of offline attendance through the “Offline Attendance Sync Report” in the web dashboard or the user app. Pay-rate Structure The Pay Rate Structure in Truein allows admins to set up earnings and deductions components to determine the net pay for each staff member at the end of the month. It can be defined as either a “per hour pay rate” or a “per day pay rate” based on the organization’s setup. This structure is reflected in the R1 Timesheet report, which includes earnings, deductions, and net pay based on the assigned Pay Rate Structure. Split Time “Split time” in Truein refers to the ability to divide a single attendance record into multiple segments. This feature is useful for employees who may have different work hours or shifts within the same day. It allows for more accurate tracking of time spent on various tasks or jobs throughout the day. Capacity Planner The Capacity Planner in Truein is a feature that helps organizations forecast and manage their workforce requirements. It allows admins to analyze the availability of staff against the demand for work, ensuring that the right number of employees are scheduled to meet operational needs. This tool aids in optimizing resource allocation and improving overall efficiency. Billing Entity In Truein, a Billing Entity is defined as the organization or entity that is responsible for making payments for the services provided. It is essential for managing billing and invoicing processes within the system Audit Trail In Truein, the “Audit Trail” refers to a feature that allows admins to view a record of all important edit operations performed in the system. This trail provides a detailed log of changes made, ensuring transparency and accountability. Admins can access the Audit Trail in real-time through the Truein dashboard under the Admin section. Org Fields In Truein, “Org Fields” refer to customizable fields within the organization settings that allow you to define various aspects of your workforce structure. This includes settings for departments, designations, staff categories, leave categories, and geographical locations like countries, states, and cities. These fields help in organizing and managing employee information effectively. Staff Fields In Truein, “Staff Fields” are customizable fields at the staff level, allowing you to define and organize detailed information for each employee. These fields cover personal information such as name and contact details, work-related details like employee ID, job title, manager, contractor agency, joining date, as well as financial information, including bank details.
