Helping businesses to bring transparency and control in Attendance & Timesheets process to improve workforce utilization and plug revenue leakages. Designed in-depth for Contract & Distributed staff use cases. Trusted by 500+ Customers Globally The start of things Founder Ankit Tanna and Jigar Pujara started Truein to address the pain areas in Time & Attendance management for contract and remotely deployed staff. In the course of his previous venture, Ankit happened to meet several of his customers and their Admin and HR leaders. During discussions, he learned about the pain areas in time and attendance management for contract and remotely deployed staff. As most of these staff were temporary and frequently changing, one common problem was registering them for attendance. Sometimes the staff directly reported at the worksite, and admins had to manually sync records across locations. He also noticed a lot of manual steps involved in Timesheets calculations for payroll. It was tedious and error-prone. Existing attendance solutions were not centralized and foolproof. The problem multifolds when the staff is distributed across customer sites with different policies for each of these sites. These problems directly impacted workforce productivity and also caused revenue leakages. Journey to Solution We embarked on this journey to fix the several issues for Contract and Distributed workforce. We built Truein, a nextgen Time and Attendance solution for organizations with a low and medium skilled workforce. The solution leverages face recognition and AI technologies. Truein brings transparency and control in the Time and Attendance process. It also helps to optimize workforce utilization and plug revenue leakages. 25 Countries 500+ Customers 500,000+ Users Truein is robust, reliable, and works as promised.

Payroll-ready Reports Automated timesheets with final calculations for payroll processing. Our Awards and Achievements Our founders had over 10 years of tech experience in India, U.S.A and Singapore and they saw a big gap in the current visitor management system. They visited large multinationals who totally disappointed them right at the gate. From tedious and manual check-in processes to unimpressive front-end, they had not evolved in a long time. There definitely existed a problem and we were all set to solve in the most futuristic way. Our first flagship product was Truein visitor management system. We introduced AI-based face-recognition systems for the first time to indian companies and the response was overwhelming. We had cracked the code at two levels – the system was secure and super fast. It was a ‘wow at first sight’. In no time, we had entered the premises and hearts of some of the biggest organizations. However, we couldn’t stop at this. We kept evolving by keeping our ears to the ground. We listened intently to our customers and helped them solve challenges with new features. Soon enough we had 100+ features in our visitor management app. We were all set to go a step further and we used our proprietary technology to launch Truein attendance, which also had 30+ features. With new applications for contract staff, remote workers and covid-safety, we are at the cutting-edge of innovation.
