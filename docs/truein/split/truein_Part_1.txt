You have the following rights regarding your Personal Information where we directly collect from you and that we control. (This does not apply to data collected by our customer organizations where We are the Processor of data): Right of Access What does it mean? Individuals will have the right to request access to the personal data. How Truein complies? You can request details of your Personal Information We hold. We will confirm whether We are processing your Personal Information and We will disclose additional information including the types of Personal Information, the sources it originated from, the purpose and legal basis for the processing, the expected retention period and the safeguards regarding data transfers to non-EEA countries, subject to the limitations set out in applicable laws and regulations.

Individuals will be able to request to delete their personal data or submit a “request to be forgotten” at any time if they no longer want their data to be stored or processed. How Truein complies?
