Employee Abscond: How to Deal with Employee Absconding Cases? May 15, 2024 Absconding employees is a menace that impacts more than productivity; it can set a bad precedent for others. If an employee absconding case within the organization is not met with professionalism and strictness, other workers can take it as an example of ignoring the absconding policy. In the simplest terms, employee absconding is when an employee disappears or stays away from work without prior notice. This absence is for an extended period or permanent, leading to disrupted workflow, productivity loss, and challenges for other employees who have to pick up the slack. There can be multiple routes to deal with employees absconding from work, but your primary focus must be understanding the reasons. If something at work is causing employees to leave abruptly without notice, it must be addressed immediately. Let’s explore some ways to deal with an employee abscond. Table of Contents How to deal with absconders? 1. Communicate with the Absconder: 2. Release all statutory payments Sample warning email to an employee absconding from work How do we minimize absconding cases at the workplace? 1. HR policy formulation 2. Recruitment and onboarding 3. Carry out HR responsibilities 4. Come up with retention strategies Conclusion FAQs 1. Can an employer take legal action against an absconding employee? 2. Is absconding the same as termination? How to deal with absconders? You must take a thoughtful and strategic approach while dealing with employee abscond. An organization must handle employees absconding from work fairly and comply with labor laws. Before you take any measures, it is essential to identify the absconding employee’s status and verify that they are indeed absconding. Companies can use software like Truein, which offers GPS geofencing features for tracking employees. While this feature is for accurate time and attendance monitoring, it also provides a clear record of employee attendance and absences. Truein can help you identify and ensure that you deal with genuine employee absconding cases. Once you are sure, you can take the following measures. 1. Communicate with the Absconder: The first step towards resolution is establishing communication with the employee absconding from work. Communicating with the absconder is essential to understand why they disappeared from work. You can encourage them to return to work if they genuinely have a reason not to attend work. Try to contact the absconder telephonically to inquire about the reasons for their absence. Listen to their concerns with an open mind and then express the organization’s expectations. Communicate that employee absconding is unacceptable, expressing understanding and concern for their situation. If the employee cooperates and responds positively, you can provide solutions to resolve the situation. Companies should always be ready to help employees address their issues while continuing to fulfill their job responsibilities. Also, all communication with an absconder must be documented. If things don’t work out and you are forced to take a legal route, all communication records will be required. 2. Release all statutory payments Even if the employee absconds and disagrees to report back to work, as an employer, you will be obliged to release all statutory payments owed to the employee. You cannot withhold payments, and it’s your ethical obligation to release payments and entitlements. Statutory payments are the legally mandated compensation and benefits – salary, overtime, unpaid wages, accumulated leave, and any bonuses or commissions – an employee is entitled to. HR should review the work-hour records of the absconding employee to identify any outstanding payments. Truein provides detailed reports of hours worked, overtime hours, leaves, accrued vacation days, etc. Time and attendance tracking software like Truein makes the payroll process easier by automating calculations. It ensures that companies accurately and timely release payments, avoiding legal complications. When calculating statutory payments, calculate any necessary deductions or withholdings, such as taxes or outstanding debts the employee owes. Ensure that applicable laws and regulations make all deductions. Prepare the final settlement detailing payments and deductions and present the final settlement to the employee in person or digitally. Sample warning email to an employee absconding from work In complex cases or when dealing with a particularly challenging absconding situation, you might have to send a warning email to ensure the organization’s message is communicated to the employee. Here’s a sample warning email template for employee absconding cases. Subject: Urgent: Return to Work or Explain Absence Dear [Employee’s Name], I hope this email finds you well. We have noticed that you have been absent from work for (days or period) without prior notice or communication. This is a matter of concern as it disrupts the team’s workflow and affects our organizational goals. We understand that personal or work-related issues can arise unexpectedly, and we always extend support to our employees and encourage open communication. Please get in touch with us to explain your absence and provide an estimated return date. If there are any challenges you are facing that are hindering your ability to work, please let us know. We are committed to helping you overcome these challenges and continue your employment. However, it is essential to resolve this matter promptly. Failure to respond to this email or continue your absence without communication seriously violates the company’s employee absconding policy. It may lead to further action as per our company policies. We look forward to hearing from you soon and working together to find a solution. Sincerely, [Your Name] [Your Position] [Company Name] How do we minimize absconding cases at the workplace? It is in the company’s interest to minimize employee absconding cases through a strategic and proactive approach. Here are some of the steps to prevent or reduce the likelihood of employee absconding: 1. HR policy formulation All current and new employees must be aware of your organization’s take on employee absconding. You should formulate a comprehensive HR policy addressing absenteeism and absconding. Clearly outline the expectations regarding attendance, leave requests, and the consequences of unauthorized absences. Your employee absconding policy should include a probationary period for new employees. This period typically lasts for the first few months of their employment, during which both parties can assess their fit. Finally, the absence policies, including the probationary period, must be communicated to all employees during onboarding. 2. Recruitment and onboarding Companies can avoid employee abscond situations with thorough screening to assess the candidate’s work history and reliability. Conduct detailed background and reference checks to identify any patterns of absenteeism in their previous roles. During the onboarding process, emphasize the company’s expectations for employees. Ensure new employees fully understand the company’s attendance policy and the consequences of unauthorized absences. 3. Carry out HR responsibilities Take your HR responsibilities seriously. Be there for employees through open and proactive communication. Promptly address any concerns or challenges that might cause absenteeism. Another responsibility of HR is to implement effective attendance tracking. Truein is a reliable cloud-based software solution to monitor employee attendance and identify potential issues early on. It creates attendance reports that help managers spot trends or patterns requiring attention. Train HR teams in conflict resolution techniques to mitigate any issues that can escalate, resulting in employees absconding from work. Organizations can create support systems, such as Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), to assist employees with personal or emotional challenges. 4. Come up with retention strategies One way to improve employee retention is to keep employees engaged and motivated. Foster a positive work environment, implement recognition programs, and create opportunities for skill development and career growth. Organizations with wellness programs supporting employees’ physical and mental health have high retention rates. Explore flexible work arrangements, including remote work options, to help employees achieve a better work-life balance. You can even provide them with flexible working hours. If needed, divide the work schedule in shifts. One can use shift scheduling softwares like Truein for the same. It can significantly reduce the likelihood of absences. It would help if you had a regular feedback mechanism working to recognize employees for their contributions. Acknowledging their efforts and value can boost job satisfaction and retention. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion Dealing with employee absconding cases can be challenging for any organization.

With tips shared here, employers can minimize disruptions and maintain a positive workplace culture by preventing employee abscond cases. FAQs 1. Can an employer take legal action against an absconding employee? Yes, employers are within their legal rights to take action against absconding employees, particularly if the absconding leads to substantial damages or breaches of employment contracts. Legal action against such employees can vary from simple legal notices to litigation for recovery of company assets, depending on applicable laws. 2. Is absconding the same as termination? No, employee absconding from work is not the same as termination. Absconding refers to an employee’s unexplained absence from work for a long time without officially resigning. At the same time, termination is a formal decision made by the company to end an employee’s contract. Termination typically involves formal documentation, notice period, severance package, and communication, whereas absconding lacks such formalities.

Understaffing costs business and is stressful for employees who have to handle increased workloads. Understaffing is a typical workforce challenge, and businesses can easily run low on the workforce needed to effectively manage their operations without planning for staff shortage. For instance, insufficient wait staff in restaurants can result in delayed services or understaffed hospitals, causing longer patient wait times. You want your business to avoid challenges like increased workloads, decreased employee morale, and potential financial losses. That’s why we created this guide to understand the causes of understaffing, the underlying consequences, and practical tips to address this issue effectively. Table of Contents Causes of being understaffed at work 1. General employee shortage 2. Seasonal fluctuations 3. High turnover 4. High rate of employee absenteeism 5. Increased business 6.

Stay positive Manage understaffing with Truein Conclusion FAQs 1. How do you keep employee morale up when you're short-staffed? 2. How can you improve the condition of being short-staffed in the long run? Causes of being understaffed at work To resolve and prevent understaffing issues, you must understand the causes. Here are some of the most common reasons why businesses are understaffed. 1. General employee shortage For longer times, if you have unfilled positions, finding the right hires can take time. For organizations employing skilled employees, finding the right talent in the job market can be difficult and can lead to a general employee shortage. 2. Seasonal fluctuations Businesses such as retail stores that experience seasonal peaks in demand may find it challenging to meet their staffing levels when the need for workers is high. Also, they might let off too many employees after peak season, resulting in understaffing during off-peak seasons. 3. High turnover Companies struggling with high employee turnover can be constantly understaffed, as replacing departing employees can take time. 4. High rate of employee absenteeism Frequent employee absenteeism is another reason that can cause unexpected staff shortages. High absenteeism can be due to illness, employee burnout , personal reasons, or unforeseen circumstances, but it should be fixed to avoid understaffing situations for the long-term. 5. Increased business Rapid growth or unexpected surges often leave businesses with staff shortages. A sudden increase in customer demand can easily outpace a business’ ability to hire and train new employees, leading to understaffing. 6. Downsizing Strategic restructuring or downsizing decisions result in layoffs, and if the cutbacks are moderate, it can result in understaffing. 7. Lack of qualified employees In some industries, such as IT, a shortage of qualified candidates with advanced skill sets can make it challenging to fill critical positions, leading to staff shortages. What happens when you're understaffed? Understaffing provides a breeding ground for several business issues impacting operations and employees. Your company can face adverse consequences affecting its operations, employees, and overall performance if constantly understaffed. The existing staff is left with additional responsibilities and workload as the organization does not have the necessary number of employees. While some employees might be able to cope with the increased workload, most may find themselves overwhelmed and need help managing their daily responsibilities effectively. The added pressure will also lead to employee burnout, severely impacting your employees’ well-being. Furthermore, working in an understaffed environment makes employees feel undervalued as they are expected to do more constantly. An overworked and demotivated workforce results in slower response times, longer waiting periods, and less personalized service, negatively impacting customer experience. Therefore, understaffing must be managed to avoid potential financial losses, missed business opportunities, and a high turnover rate. 15 Tips to Resolve Understaffing Problem 1. Recognize your staffing needs You can only expect to manage understaffing by acknowledging your company’s staffing requirements. Organizations must conduct a thorough assessment to understand each department or team’s specific tasks and responsibilities. It will help them identify the aspects of the workforce, such as peak work periods, bottlenecks, and areas that require additional support. It will also help them assess if current employees have the necessary skills to handle assignments. Anticipating staffing needs based on business growth projections, market trends, and seasonality helps avoid understaffing. 2. Communicate with the team Please communicate with your staff to let them know that the company is understaffed. Provide full disclosure as to why there are not enough employees. This can be done by holding regular team meetings to discuss the staffing shortage. Encourage team members to share their concerns and suggestions for managing the workload per project priorities and deadlines. There should be a feedback loop to gather employee reviews on how to streamline workflows to alleviate the impact of understaffing. 3. Do staff augmentation Staff augmentation refers to supplementing your existing workforce with temporary or contract employees. Suppose you need help finding employees to fill positions that require specific skills; partner with staffing agencies or freelance platforms. That way, you can find qualified temporary employees to integrate into your team seamlessly. Staff augmentation offers flexibility to address immediate staffing shortages. It can be a cost-effective way to manage understaffing in the long run. 4. Integrate technology & reduce admin work Leveraging technology is one of the best ways to optimize workflows and streamline administrative tasks. This can significantly reduce the impact of understaffing on the teams. Automation tools like Truein can handle repetitive administrative processes, such as time and attendance monitoring, overtime and leave calculations, and scheduling. Your staff time is freed that can be invested in higher-value tasks. Task management tools like Asana and Jira can help teams prioritize work to improve delivery and progress. Integrating technology into workforce management reduces the administrative burden on employees and enhances overall efficiency and productivity. 5. Get leaders involved You must have read how Mark Zuckerberg overhauled the managers at Meta by asking them not just to manage but also code . It is an example of getting leaders involved when times get tough. Understaffing can harbor resentment among employees if they feel others are not carrying their weight. That’s why senior-level employees must be as involved as lower-level workers. 6. Do scenario planning You have to consider various scenarios teams can face for accurate staffing plans. This approach will train your employees to handle ad hoc requests or avoid force majeure outside the project timeline. Scenario planning ensures no ripple effect because of understaffing, and operations continue even with added demands. 7. Outsource tasks Outsourcing can help mitigate the risks posed by understaffing. Companies can delegate non-core or specialized functions and processes to external service providers. For instance, manufacturing companies can outsource IT support, and fintech organizations can outsource customer support. However, outsourcing tasks require carefully choosing the outsourcing partners based on their expertise and track record. 8. Implement reskilling and upskilling initiatives Training programs that allow employees to reskill and upskill help businesses weather a staffing shortage by redistributing the workforce to fill different roles and responsibilities. For instance, machinists can be supervisors if they know the whole manufacturing cycle. Offering professional development opportunities also improves employee retention . 9. Consider internships Internships provide organizations an opportunity to address understaffing at the same time, groom future full-time employees. Interns can assist with non-core tasks and projects and bring fresh perspectives to the team. Create structured internship programs that provide candidates with skill development opportunities in exchange for adding value to your organization. 10. Cross-train employees Cross-training employees create a workforce that can perform multiple roles. When you have employees who can take on various roles and handle inter-domain responsibilities, you can minimize the impact of understaffing on productivity. Identify the roles that have overlapping skills or responsibilities and then create structured training plans that employees can take to juggle between roles when required. Periodically assess employees’ progress to ensure they acquire new skills and their ability to perform in multiple roles. 11. Set a culture of teamwork Your cross-training efforts will only be fruitful if you cultivate a culture of teamwork at the workplace. Leaders should lead by example by actively participating in team efforts and demonstrating collaboration. Companies that encourage open and effective communication among team members foster teamwork. Recognize and reward instances of exceptional cooperation to motivate employees to support each other, distribute workloads evenly, and work harmoniously when understaffed. 12. Prioritize tasks Understaffing often leads to the urgency of prioritizing tasks to ensure mission-critical tasks are completed on time. Clearly define deadlines and goals for jobs and projects, as it helps set priorities. When teams are aware of crucial work, it is completed first. Task management tools make tracking progress and prioritizing tasks easier. Additionally, they review jobs regularly to adjust their priorities to adapt to changing business circumstances and demands. 13. Don't overwork your employees Understaffing often leads to an overworked workforce. If your employees are overworking regularly, it will adversely affect their well-being and productivity. Also, it can lead to employee burnout . Managers should ensure that employee workloads remain manageable and reasonable. Encouraging work-life balance, even when you are understaffed, is essential. 14. Increase employee perks & benefits When your employees work extra to compensate for understaffing, it is only fair to provide higher perks and benefits as a reward. If possible, offer flexible work hours or remote work options to give employees greater control over their schedules even when working more. Consider offering additional paid vacation days and health and wellness programs to let employees relax and recharge. 15. Stay positive Understaffing pressures employers, but maintaining a positive outlook and attitude is vital for success. Managers and supervisors should exude resilience and optimism. Communication with employees regularly to address understaffing and the progress being made boosts their morale. Learn to celebrate small achievements and milestones, no matter how modest they may seem.
