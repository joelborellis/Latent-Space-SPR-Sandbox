That’s why Wisconsin PTO laws protect employees’ rights to take time off when they need it. As an employer, it is important to frame company leave policies guided by federal and state regulations, ensuring employees have access to the necessary leave when needed. This Wisconsin PTO payout laws guide covers different aspects, such as maternity and paternity leave, sick leave, vacation leave, military leave, voting leave, jury duty leave, bereavement leave, and more. Table of Contents FMLA Federal Law followed in Wisconsin Maternity and Paternity Leave Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act Child Care Leave Family Illness Leave Paid Time Off in Wisconsin Sick Leave Bone Marrow and Organ Donation Leave Vacation Leave Military Leave Voting Leave in Wisconsin Jury Duty Leave Bereavement Leave Civil Air Patrol Leave PTO Payout on Termination in Wisconsin How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion FMLA Federal Law followed in Wisconsin The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees in Wisconsin with unpaid, job-protected leave for specific family and medical reasons. All employers in the state must adhere to the guidelines of FMLA, promising employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in 12 months for any of the following reasons: The birth and care of a newborn child Adoption or foster care placement of a child Medical care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) suffering from a serious health condition Employee’s serious health condition leaving them incapable of performing their duties An eligible employee for FMLA benefits meets the following criteria: Working with the current employee for at least 12 months Worked at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months Works at a location where 50 or more employees work within 75 miles radius There are certain leaves covered under FMLA, this includes: Maternity and Paternity Leave Under the FMLA, new parents can take unpaid maternity or paternity leave for up to 12 weeks to care for their newborn child. The act ensures that both mothers and fathers can take time off within 12 months of the child’s birth to care for and bond with the child. Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act To further protect the rights of pregnant employees, the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) prohibits any discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The Pregnancy Disability Act also provides the same rights to pregnant employees unable to perform their duties due to pregnancy as other disability acts. Both these acts require employers to treat pregnant employees fairly and entitle them to reasonable accommodations if needed during pregnancy. Child Care Leave Under FMLA, parents can take leave for adoption or foster care placement. This leave is intended to help families transition during these important life events, ensuring that employees do not have to choose between their jobs and family. Child care leave is unpaid. Child care leave entitled employees: To take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child care Use unpaid time off for attending to the requirements of child including medical care, school obligations, etc. Six weeks of leave within 16 weeks before or after the birth or adoption Family Illness Leave The family illness leave provision of FMLA entitles all employees within the state of Wisconsin to take up to 12 weeks of FMLA leave to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) who suffers from a serious health condition. Employees cannot use family illness leave for their medical care. In addition to the FMLA, Wisconsin state law allows employees to take up to two weeks per year to attend to the serious health condition of a parent (including parents-in-law), child, or spouse. Paid Time Off in Wisconsin There are no state laws on Paid time off (PTO) in Wisconsin, and policies regarding PTO are generally governed by employer policies. However, many employers offer PTO as a benefit to attract and retain employees. Wisconsin has no law that mandates employers to allow accrual of PTO. However, if employers decide to allow accrual of paid time off, they must mention how employees earn leave based on the time they work. For example, an employee might earn one day of PTO for every month worked. Additionally, in Wisconsin use-it-or-lose-it” policy is not prohibited, giving employers the right to prohibit the rollover of accrued, unused PTO. Sick Leave In Wisconsin, all employers are required to abide by the FMLA federal provisions and provide eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. Under FMLA, employees can use sick to: Take care of their serious medical condition Birth or adoption of a child Care for a family member suffering from a serious medical condition In addition to the federal FMLA, the state also has the Wisconsin Family and Medical Leave Act (WFMLA) governing employee sick leave. The WFMLA applies to all employers with 50 or more employees. The WFMLA provides eligible employees with unpaid leave for: Up to two weeks of leave for an employee’s serious health condition Up to two weeks of leave to care for a parent, child, or spouse with a serious health condition Up to six weeks of leave for the birth or adoption of a child Bone Marrow and Organ Donation Leave The Bone Marrow and organ donation leave act states that employees who are donating bone marrow or an organ can take “no more than six weeks of leave in 12 months” to “undergo the bone marrow or organ donation procedure and to recover from the procedure.” Employers can ask for written verification from employees to ensure that they have bone marrow or organ donation scheduled before they approve time off. Vacation Leave Vacation leave in Wisconsin is not mandated by state law, meaning employers are not required to provide paid or unpaid vacation. However, if the employers offer vacation leave as a benefit, they must mention it in the employee handbooks and employment contracts. The policy should also cover whether this leave is paid or unpaid. Employees can hold employers accountable for providing paid/unpaid vacation leave if it is included in their work contract. Military Leave Wisconsin has federal and state laws regarding military leave that employers must adhere to. The federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is applicable throughout the state. It provides protections for employees serving in the military for up to five years to take time off for military service. Under USERRA, employees who leave for military service have the right to continue their employer-based health insurance for themselves and their families for up to 24 months. They are also entitled to immediate reinstatement of their health insurance upon reemployment. Wisconsin’s state military leave law applies to only permanent state employees called into active service. According to Wis. Stat. § 230.08 , the law applies when an eligible state employee is called “into active service in the armed forces of the United States or is requested to work for the federal government during a national emergency or a limited national emergency.” The active service period cannot be more than 4 years, and employees should be reinstated within 180 days after relief from service. Voting Leave in Wisconsin Wisconsin law requires employers to grant employees up to three hours of unpaid leave to vote in an election. However, employers must request vote leave in advance, and the employer may choose the time of day the leave is taken. Jury Duty Leave Wisconsin mandates that all employers provide employees selected for jury duty enough time off to participate in their civil duty. Employees who are summoned for jury duty are protected by state law from adverse employment actions. Employers cannot discharge or threaten to discharge an employee for taking time off to serve as a juror. Employers are not required to pay for jury duty leave. However, some employers pay for jury duty leave to encourage employees. The court compensates jurors in Wisconsin for their service at a rate of $16 a day. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave in Wisconsin is not mandated by law. Employers have full discretion to decide to offer bereavement leave as a benefit. However, most employers provide bereavement leave to allow their employees to take time off after the death of a loved one, typically a close family member. Most companies in the state offer up to 3 consecutive days off for bereavement. Civil Air Patrol Leave Wisconsin law allows employees who are members of the Civil Air Patrol to take unpaid leave for up to 15 days per year to participate in Civil Air Patrol missions. However, members cannot take more than 5 consecutive days off. Civil air patrol leave is for emergency missions only and can be approved if it does not unduly disrupt the company’s operations. Employers are prohibited from firing or disciplining employees for taking this leave. PTO Payout on Termination in Wisconsin In Wisconsin, the payout of accrued, unused vacation time upon termination of employment depends on the employer’s policies in the absence of any federal or state provision. If employers allow the payout of accrued, unused vacation time in company policy or any employment agreement, the employer must honor this agreement. Conversely, if the employer’s policy explicitly states that unused vacation time will not be paid out upon termination, the employer is not obligated to provide such a payout. When an employee is terminated or leaves voluntarily, Wisconsin employers must provide the employee’s final paycheck by the next regular payday or within 31 days, whichever is earlier.

If you are an employer in Oregon, it is essential to keep up with the updated PTO Laws to be compliant. We have created this guide to help employers understand the PTO compliance requirements. Table of Contents Overview of the New Oregon PTO Law Paid Leave Compensation FMLA Federal Law followed in Oregon The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) Parenting Leave under FMLA Birth and Bonding Leave Adoption and Foster Care Leave Serious Health Condition Leave under FMLA Oregon Sick Time Law and Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA) Types of Leave Under OFLA 1. Parental Leave 2. Serious Health Condition Leave 3. Military Family Leave 4. Pregnancy Disability Leave 5. Sick Child Leave 6. Bereavement Leave When Companies are eligible for both OFLA and FMLA, what do they do? Payout Requirements on Termination in Oregon Paid Time Off in Oregon Vacation Sick Leave Safe Leave (Sexual, Domestic Violence/Harassment, Stalking, etc.) Roll-Over/Carried-Forward Leaves Accruals Bereavement Leave Jury Duty Leave Military Leave Voting Leave Requirements for Employers regarding Paid Time Off in Oregon How Truein Can Help with Paid Time Off Management Conclusion Overview of the New Oregon PTO Law On January 1, 2023, the state of Oregon implemented the paid leave law, formally known as Paid Leave Oregon . This law allows all employees, irrespective of their employer size, to receive paid time off for up to 12 weeks. However, note that Paid Leave Oregon is not an exclusive PTO law, and it runs in conjunction with the existing Oregon Sick Time Law and the Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA). In addition, all employers must also consider federal regulations, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), to ensure full compliance with PTO laws. Paid Leave Compensation Under Paid Leave Oregon law, employers are not required to pay their employees; they are paid from the newly created state fund. Depending on your business size, you must contribute to the state fund as an employer. The employees and the rest contribute 60% of the total contribution rate, 40%, by the employer or the state of Oregon if the employer has 25 or fewer employees. The Oregon Sick Time Law provides paid or unpaid sick leave to employees, depending on the employer’s size. All employers with 10 or more employees must offer paid sick leave. Employers should pay 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked. New employees start earning paid time off as soon as they start working. However, employers can put a waiting period of 90 days before new employees can start using their paid time off. No employee can accrue more than 40 hours a year of paid sick time off. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is the federal law that employers should adhere to along with OFLA. Under federal law, employers should give employees 12 weeks of unpaid time off for medical and family emergencies. FMLA Federal Law followed in Oregon The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected annual leave for specific family and medical reasons. To be eligible for time off under FMLA, employees should have worked with their current employer for at least 12 months continuously, at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months, and at a site with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. Additionally, FMLA is an application for employers with 50 or more employees. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) In addition to the FMLA, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) applies to all employers in Oregon. This federal law prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The PDA requires employers to treat pregnant employees the same as other employees with similar abilities or limitations. This includes providing leave for pregnancy-related conditions if the employer provides leave for other temporary disabilities. Parenting Leave under FMLA All eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of maternity/paternity leave under FMLA. Employees can use this time off to care for a newborn child or a newly placed adopted or foster child. This leave is unpaid and generally is offered as an additional benefit. Birth and Bonding Leave Birth and bonding leave under FMLA allows eligible employees to take time off to bond with a newborn or newly placed adopted or foster child. It includes 12 weeks of unpaid time off. Adoption and Foster Care Leave FMLA also recognizes adoption and foster care as a reason for unpaid time off, similar to maternity/paternity leave. All eligible employees can ask for adoption or foster care leave of up to 12 weeks to care for an adopted or foster child newly placed in their home. Serious Health Condition Leave under FMLA Eligible employees can take time off under FMLA to care for themselves or a family member if they are suffering from a serious health condition. This leave is unpaid and doesn’t have accrual approval. It is included in the FMLA provision and allows employees to take up to 12 weeks. Oregon Sick Time Law and Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA) The Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA) is the state law that provides additional protection to employees if they work for an employer with 25 or more workers. Under OFLA, employees can take unpaid leave of up to 12 weeks for home care, pregnancy disability, bereavement, and legal procedures for foster care of a child. OFLA provides broader protections than the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and is designed to cover more employers and employees, including those at smaller businesses. Types of Leave Under OFLA 1. Parental Leave Parental leave is part of the FMLA provision that gives employees the right to unpaid time off to attend to parental responsibilities such as bonding with a new child after birth, adoption, or foster placement. All employers should provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid PTO for newborns or foster kids. 2. Serious Health Condition Leave Under OFLA, all employees can get up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off to care for themselves or a family member with a serious health condition. 3. Military Family Leave Military family leaves under OFLA provide up to 14 days of time off for employees to spend time with a family member in the military and on leave from active duty. 4. Pregnancy Disability Leave OFLA provides up to 12 weeks of leave for employees who are unable to work due to a pregnancy-related disability. It can be used before or after the birth of a child. 5. Sick Child Leave Sick child leave under OFLA allows employees to take time off to care for a sick child who requires home care but has no serious health condition. This leave can be up to 12 weeks a year, and is generally unpaid, but employers may offer paid or allow employees to use accrued paid leave. 6. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave allows employees to take time off following the death of a family member. Under OFLA, employers must provide up to two weeks of bereavement leave. When Companies are eligible for both OFLA and FMLA, what do they do? It can be challenging to decide as Oregon PTO laws include both OFLA and FMLA. Employers must coordinate the two as they can simultaneously count employees against OFLA and FMLA entitlements. If an employee needs FMLA or OFLA leave for multiple qualifying conditions or purposes simultaneously or in the same leave year, you can count them against FMLA and OFLA leaves. However, having more than one qualifying condition does not allow employees to extend their entitlement. Payout Requirements on Termination in Oregon Employers in Oregon are not required to pay accrued, unused vacation time on termination. This applies to all employees regardless of their employer period or type of employment. However, if there is a clear policy or agreement stating otherwise, employers must adhere to the policies agreed upon. Employers must maintain and communicate clear policies regarding vacation payout with employees to avoid disputes. Paid Time Off in Oregon Vacation Oregon doesn’t require employers to provide vacation days. It is at the sole discretion of the employers to provide vacation time off, paid or unpaid. Generally, most employers in the state offer vacation days as benefits for a competitive edge. Employers can set their vacation accrual, usage, and payout policies if they comply with state wage payment laws regarding accrued, unused vacation time. Sick Leave Oregon allows employees to earn 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. However, not all employers are required to offer paid sick leave. Under Oregon PTO law, employers with more than 10 employees must provide paid sick leave to employees up to 40 hours per year. Safe Leave (Sexual, Domestic Violence/Harassment, Stalking, etc.) Safe leave in Oregon allows employees to take time off to address issues related to sexual or domestic violence, harassment, or stalking. Effective January 1, 2024 , all employees can avail up to 160 hours of paid time off every year as safe leave. This time off is in addition to other PTO such as sick days, jury duty, etc. Roll-Over/Carried-Forward Leaves There is no state law on PTO accrual. The roll-over or carried-forward leave rules, such as vacation or paid time off (PTO), largely depend on company policy rather than specific state mandates. Employers can allow or disallow the roll-over of PTO, depending on their company policies. However, if an employer chooses to offer these benefits, they must adhere to the terms of their own established policies or employment contracts. Most employees allow rollover as a benefit; however, they cap the number of hours employees can carry forward to next year. If you plan to offer accrual and roll-over of leaves, you must: Clearly communicate such policies to employees, typically through an employee handbook or a written contract. If you implement a “use it or lose it” policy, describe that employees must use their vacation or PTO within a given timeframe or forfeit it. Provide information on how much vacation or PTO employees can accrue. If you cap the roll-over of PTO, tell employees then when they reach a certain limit, they cannot accrue more time until they use some of their stored leave. Accruals Paid sick leave is the only paid time off mandated by the Oregon PTO laws. Under the Oregon sick time law, employees accrue one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours per year. Employers can front-load sick leave at the beginning of the year or allow employees to accrue leave over time. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave in Oregon is provided under OFLA, requiring certain employees to offer up to 2 weeks of unpaid time off for bereavement. Employers with 25 or more employees must provide bereavement leave to employees to take time off following the death of a family member. The leave counts against an employee’s total OFLA entitlements. Typically unpaid, some employers choose to offer paid bereavement leave as a benefit. The leave can be taken for up to two weeks per family member within 60 days of receiving death notice. Jury Duty Leave Jury duty is a civic responsibility, and Oregon law requires employers to provide unpaid leave for employees to serve on a jury. Employers can put a notice requiring employees to show proof of their jury duty when they ask for leave. No employers can take retaliatory action against employees on jury duty leave. Jury duty leave is unpaid in Oregon. The court pays a daily stipend of $10 to jurors, and employers are not required to compensate employees for jury duty leave. Military Leave Under state and federal law, military employees in Oregon are given special protections and benefits. Oregon state law provides military leave for employees who serve in the Oregon National Guard or are members of other U.S. armed forces reserve components. However, state law requires that such employees report back to work within 7 days or be released from their duties. The Oregon Military Family Leave Act (OMFLA) also applies to employees working for an employer with 25 or more employees. Under OMFLA, eligible employees can take up to 2 weeks of unpaid leave for military family reasons. The federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) also applies to all employers in Oregon. Under USERRA, employers must allow employees called for active service up to 5 years of unpaid time off. Such employees can also continue their employer-based health insurance coverage for up to 24 months while on military leave. USERRA and Oregon state laws provide reemployment rights for employees returning from military service. The law requires employers to reemploy returning service members in the job they would have attained if they had not been absent for military service, with the same seniority, status, and pay. Voting Leave Oregon law does not require employers to provide paid or unpaid leave for employees to vote. However, employers cannot prevent employees from voting or penalize them for exercising their right to vote, given that employees don’t use their office hours to vote. Employers are encouraged to provide time off for employees to vote, particularly if they cannot vote during non-working hours. Requirements for Employers regarding Paid Time Off in Oregon Employers must be aware of the state and federal requirements for paid time off. Here are some essential requirements to know: Employers should put up a poster or communicate about the Paid Leave Oregon provision with employees without failing. Information to be shared includes employees’ rights, how to apply for Paid Leave in Oregon and their right to job protection. Creating fair policies to allow employees to be eligible for paid time off. Regularly submitting their employer contributions towards the state fund. Creating channels to collect and submit employee contributions to the state fund. Accurately reporting total employee numbers and total contributions to the state authorities.
