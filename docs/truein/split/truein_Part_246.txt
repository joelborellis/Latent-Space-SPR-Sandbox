From recruiting, addressing injuries, and retaining to training, overcoming mundane work culture, and engaging the employees, challenges at the workplace affect a company’s overall culture and productivity. The manufacturing industry is vast, dynamic, and diverse, so it is more susceptible to challenges and technological disruptions than other industries. What’s more, this industry is in continuous flux because of changing technologies and demographics. Let’s look at the top 6 challenges faced by HRs in the manufacturing industry and how to overcome them. Table of Contents 1. Shortage of workers 2. Minimizing injuries of workers and safety incidents 3. Low employee engagement 4. Retaining workers 5. Training the employees 6. Challenges in recruiting new workers 7. Managing attendance and shifts of workers 1. Shortage of workers The manufacturing industry is reeling under the effect of a shortage of workers for several reasons, like the misconception in the minds of young professionals that this sector lacks compelling wages, sophistication, and innovation. Thus, HR must address this problem of a shortage of workforce. The teams must find the best ways possible to replenish the human capital required by the organization. Manufacturing industries should also emphasize recruiting millennials because they have good technical skills and knowledge. Millennials stigmatize the manufacturing sector as an outdated and slow career option that doesn’t go well with their idea and passion for new technologies. HR should offer attractive salary packages and other perks to the millennials so that they develop an interest in the manufacturing sector and start working in it once again. Once they gain that confidence, the workforce shortage problem will eventually subside. 2. Minimizing injuries of workers and safety incidents Manufacturing employees are in danger of industrial accidents and injuries due to their involvement with the planers, machines, lathes, and other production tools and equipment. Also, as in battery manufacturing, workers who work with dangerous chemicals are exposed to lead. Falls and trips are also common threats in the manufacturing industry. The employees are at high risk when they work on ladders, cherry pickers, high platforms, and other elevated platforms. Also, noise from the machines can harm their ears when exposed to loud sounds for an extended period. HR in the manufacturing industry must hire and retain skilled employees that can operate machines effectively and, thus, minimize accidents. Further, companies should train workers in first aid to help others and themselves in emergencies. Another solution for HR in the manufacturing sector is that the companies should conduct training activities that are focused on safety at the workplace, like operating the machinery safely, avoiding injuries and accidents, and minimizing harm in case of accidents. Lastly, the industry must have a supervisor on the ground to check if all safety procedures are carefully followed. “Promoting worker safety goes beyond just the safety manual or handbook . It’s really about creating a culture that’s committed to [and] very much focused on safety and accountability. It’s about preventing, reducing, or eliminating the severity or claim before it ultimately happens.” – Brian Kramer, Manufacturing Industry Practice Leader, The Hartford 3. Low employee engagement Another challenge the manufacturing industry HR faces is the need for more employee engagement. This is one of the most significant reasons for high turnover rates in the manufacturing sector. So by following the right employee engagement strategy, the industry can benefit from the increase in productivity. As the manufacturing sector is labor-oriented, it may be hard for the employees to maintain that work-life balance. The HRs should regularly ensure that there are various employee engagement activities within the company so that the workers do not feel demotivated. Also, there must be a reward for the achievements. HR challenges in the manufacturing units do not just end at training and development; the workplace needs to be supportive and engaging as per the needs of the employees. The employee relationship and work culture are significant in overall employee engagement. There is also a need to allow flexibility to employees for personal necessities and work-life balance. 4. Retaining workers Most HR departments in the manufacturing industry face the real challenge of retaining employees and specialized talent. Employee retention is one of the most crucial issues in the manufacturing industry. The HR department must ensure that the workers are retained through better engagement, perks, good salaries, easy work culture, a safe work environment, and more. When employees see these benefits, they will feel secure and not think of changing the organization or industry. HR must provide horizontal job options that may be less physically demanding so that the seniors are encouraged to stay in the company. It is also important to encourage the seniors to take benefit of the digital training that your firm provides so that they have the skills as per the latest trends and changes. 5. Training the employees HR also needs to provide proper training to their employees so that they can be updated with the latest developments. The HR professionals must focus on training the employees to stay ahead in the competition and to keep the staff motivated. It is also crucial for HR to offer adequate training to keep the employees updated with the latest developments in the industry and to prepare them for challenges. Training and development are critical in enhancing personal and professional growth and creating excellent employee satisfaction and stimulation. Besides the much-needed changes required in recruitment, employee retention, and worker engagement, effective training and development are at the top of the list of things that HR must focus on in the manufacturing industry to stay competitive in the global marketplace. 6. Challenges in recruiting new workers Recruitment and staffing are important parts of any organization. It has been seen that 80 percent of manufacturers recognize the importance of meeting workforce demands over the next 5 years. The challenges posed by recruiting within the manufacturing industry are deep-rooted. To address these issues, the manufacturing HR department should learn to compete with other sectors and start filling gaps. The HR department manages employee-related activities such as payroll management, recruitment, and employee development. As HR is the heart of every company, small and medium enterprises need help managing HR functions. Many organizations outsource the support or secondary work to external vendors, enabling them to focus on the primary business. Outsourcing recruiting of workers is also done so that the best of the workforce is recruited. 7. Managing attendance and shifts of workers Another challenge that the HR department in the manufacturing industry face is managing the shift and attendance of workers. Due to a lack of employee engagement, injuries, and retention issues, employees show up less, and there is a discrepancy in managing the shift and attendance.

Human resource management is complex, especially when dealing with unauthorized absences , such as workers leaving work premises without permission. Such activities can have significant implications both financially and operationally. Several problems arise if workers start leaving work premises without permission. The company’s production goals become challenging, which can significantly impact the revenue. Also, such time theft puts undue pressure on other employees who have to take up the slack. As a manager, handling such unexpected absences from work can be tricky. However, leaving the workplace without permission is misconduct, and you must understand how to handle such behavior. In this article, we will discuss how you can avoid any disruption in production by managing such absences. Table of Contents 4 ways to manage employees who leave work without permission 1. Talk to your employees about it 2. Create a plan and mention it in your policy 3. Explain the consequences of leaving early 4. Give a warning to employees who leave early What if your employee still leaves early? Can you fire them? How Truein can help with it 4 ways to manage employees who leave work without permission 1. Talk to your employees about it Before you conclude, ask the employee why they left early. Leaving work premises without permission only sometimes amounts to time theft. As a manager, you can bring genuine care and concern to the employee facing challenging family circumstances and help them figure out how to balance work and personal life. Talk to your employees because showing compassion is essential if they are going through some trouble or illness. At the same time, if you find out that the employees left early to have fun, you must let them know that you are strict with such behavior at work so they don’t take advantage of you. It is necessary to keep the lines of communication open to let employees know what you expect of them and make them realize that you will support their best work. 2. Create a plan and mention it in your policy Suppose your employees are habitually leaving the workplace without permission despite clear communication about expectations from them. In that case, it’s time to create an attendance policy and mention about it. Once you have listened to what is going on with your employees and understand the situation, you can frame policies based on the same to offer information to employees and address the issue prompting the early departures. It is crucial to provide information on family leave for accommodation for illness days such that employees are allowed to leave the workplace with permission. HR managers should work with employees to ensure that the management and workforce are on the same page about leaving work premises without permission. Your employees are a valuable resource, and being flexible with them is reasonable. Still, your plan should be framed keeping in mind that every worker can only take advantage of the company’s attendance policy. 3. Explain the consequences of leaving early Ultimately, you have to make the hard decision and hand over the consequences if someone isn’t doing their job. Exactly what the consequences of leaving work premises without permission can be will depend on your company and management structure. In some instances, you can accept a written apology from the workers. At the same time, other scenarios may demand stricter consequences, such as making up for the missed time or taking on some additional tasks. It is essential to mention the consequences worker can face if they repeatedly leave the workplace without permission. This will ensure that your employees are not surprised when they face the consequences after repeatedly violating the policy. 4. Give a warning to employees who leave early If, despite all your efforts, workers continue leaving the workplace without permission, you have to give them a warning. Chances are that you have already mentioned the consequence clearly in the attendance policy, but it’s also beneficial to create a leaving work premise without a permission warning letter. The letter should explain to your employees that chronically leaving work early will be met with stern actions, and they must correct their behavior immediately. At this stage, there is no need to put up with their excuses; ensure that you are approachable if the employee has some new information to help you make a better decision. Here is a template of leaving work premises without permission warning letter that you can use. Ref: ________ Date: _______ To (Name of the Employee) (Designation) (Department) Employee Code: ______ Sub.: Leaving early from work – Violation of Company Policy Dear Mr. / Ms. (First Name of the Employee), We regret to note that you were repeatedly leaving early from work early from (Date) to (Date) without taking any prior permission, nor have you informed the causes of leaving early. Our company does not appreciate such unprofessional conduct from its employees. All employees are required to follow the working hour’s guidelines and leave application procedure before going on any leave or leaving early. You are hereby strongly advised not to repeat such incidents in the future, as this letter serves as the final warning before any severe disciplinary action against you. We are also not deducting any amount from your salary. In case of repetition of such incidents, the company will be forced to terminate your employment. This letter will be placed on your personnel employment file. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter by signing one copy of the letter as enclosed herewith.

Can you fire them? Leaving early from work without permission is a clear act of miss conduct. You can fire a worker for leaving work premises without consent, without reasonable excuse. If a worker leaves the work premises without permission once or twice, it is appropriate to have a conversation to understand their issue. If they cannot provide an acceptable reason, you should issue them a leaving work premises without permission warning letter. And if the employee repeats the behavior of leaving the workplace without permission, they should face the consequences. Any further repetition of such behavior can lead to severe penalties such as demotion, suspension without pay, or dismissal.

PTO policy means that employees will get their pay even when they do not attend the office for a specific period. PTO leave can be taken for various reasons, including grief, sickness, vacation, marriage, or even when you want to spend some personal time with your family. Table of Contents What is PTO? How does PTO work? Types of PTO 1. Vacation time 2. Sick time 3. Personal days 4. Bereavement leaves 5. Parental leaves 6. Paid holidays 7. National holidays Floating leaves Why is it important to understand the PTO policy of your company? Advantages and disadvantages of PTO Advantages of Paid time off Disadvantages of Paid time off Conclusion How can Truein help? What is PTO? Paid time off is when you are paid for not working. It includes holidays, sick time, and all wrapped up under one category that permits you to use the time as you want. In a large organization, a PTO leave policy bundles the personal days off, vacation, and sick days in a specific block of hours rather than separating days for each reason. More and more companies now offer unlimited PTO leaves where you do not have to accrue time before taking paid leave from your work. But there are stipulations like being with the organization for a specific time. How does PTO work? PTO primarily works by allowing employees to accrue leave over a particular time. When the employees work for, say a month, a specific number of PTO leaves is granted. It is like a savings bank account- the more you invest, the more you earn the interest. For instance, salaried employees get 1.5 PTOs each month, so their accrued PTO will be 18 days collected over a year. Also alternatively, companies can allot a set number of paid time offs and hours to the employees based on what policy they have in their organization. In such cases, PTO is not accrued, but they stay constant throughout the year. This is how PTO works in traditional setups. In various systems, PTO leaves are as per the company policy. For example, a company provides 30 leaves per year- 10 vacation leaves, 10 casual leaves, 8 sick leaves, and 2 personal leaves. PTO offers employees these 30 days under a single category- Time off. The organization can also sanction all these leaves at once or divide the days into 7 for each quarter or 15 days for every 6 months. Types of PTO While many people link PTO with sick time or vacation only, the actual meaning of PTO can apply to when employees get paid while they are not working. As a result, you can say there are many types of PTO. Here we will list the most common PTO types. 1. Vacation time Vacation time is the pre-planned time that an employee takes for rest, recreation and relaxation. The amount of leaves an employee takes for vacation is typically between a few days to 2 weeks. The employee requests the time off and schedules well in advance so that there is no disruption of work while they are away. 2. Sick time Sick leaves are the period of time when the employee stays at home to recover from an injury or illness, and takes medical treatment for themselves or their family members. Mostly the sick leaves are not planned as the employees cannot predict their sickness time or when a family member will get injured or ill. In such cases, the work gets hampered to a certain extent. But there are certain cases where an employee can plan in advance to use the sick leaves, like when they are preparing for some upcoming surgery, etc. 3. Personal days Personal days are when an employee takes off from work for personal reasons other than vacation or illness. Here, employees can use the personal days according to their will, which may or may not be pre-planned. Some examples of personal days include but are not restricted to attending some appointments, moving/shifting, taking a break to prevent burnout, responding to some emergencies, etc. 4. Bereavement leaves Bereavement leave is when an employee takes off to grieve and cope with the death of some family member. The employer has the discretion to take the decision who qualifies as the immediate family member, with most companies recognizing the relatives of an employee as their immediate family members like spouse, children, parents, and parents in law, son in law and daughter in law, grandparents, grandchildren, brother, sister, or any other member from the same family. A company’s bereavement policy establishes a pre-determined amount of time that an employee can take off after the death of a family member, with some employers even offering flexibility in extending the time period over others. 5. Parental leaves Parental leaves are the days when an employee gets away from work, getting the full payment when there is a new addition to the family. Parental offs vary company by company, with some offering more parental leaves than others. There are some companies as well that are more lenient when it comes to approving parental leaves. Also, some companies offer maternity leaves to just women who are pregnant or who have just given birth. Other firms offer paternal leaves to fathers as well. Further, some companies approve parental leave for employees who choose to adopt a child. 6. Paid holidays Paid leaves are when a company offers its employees paid day off to spend some time with their family or even celebrate a publicly recognized holiday. Some companies remain open on the paid holidays and offer their employees the choice to attend the office for double the pay that day. Companies can select which holidays they offer as paid leaves with many of them recognizing approximately 10 holidays per year. 7. National holidays National leaves are the set publicly declared holidays that the employees get. The companies usually set these under their PTO policy. Floating leaves Floating holidays are the leaves when a company allows employees to choose a paid holiday. Employees can use the floating leave for publicly recognized holidays when their company doesn’t consider a specific leave a paid holiday. Some companies even allow employees to use the floating holidays for the crucial days that are non-publicly recognized like birthdays or anniversaries of the employee. Why is it important to understand the PTO policy of your company? Knowing how your company’s PTO policy works are crucial as it helps to ensure that you maximize your employee benefits. Knowing and understanding how the PTO policy works allows you to plan the time you take off and to create a healthy life-work balance. You may wish to use the PTO to address your family’s needs, recover or heal from a sickness or injury, or even take a vacation for relaxation. Knowing how the company’s PTO policy works can further help the employees to use their time at work productively and improve their overall job performance. When you understand what to expect from your PTO policies, you can use the time at work in a better way and focus on the tasks that need your attention rather than finding time to address things that need your attention outside of work. Advantages and disadvantages of PTO Advantages of Paid time off PTO policy can serve as a recruitment incentive and attract employees Provide vacation time to the employees who do not use the banked time for other things The employees can use the leaves as and when required when some unforeseen situations arise Shorter and more frequent vacations can help to maintain that work-life balance Reduces absenteeism Easier for HR to manage the leaves Offers flexibility and autonomy to employees Disadvantages of Paid time off A lot of employees may wish to take some days off at the year-end to avoid losing the leave When an employee quits, the management has to honor PTO commitments A large number of hours can look like a lot of time than it actually is to the employees who do not consider that it covers several purposes Employees may even run out of PTOs and may be required to work when they are sick or lose their pay Some employees hoard sick leaves Conclusion Employees of a company need long paid time off. An organization gains more popularity if it has an impressive PTO policy. The employee can take a break from work without affecting their pay. Companies also benefit from the PTO policy since the employees return to work with refreshed minds, more energy, and relaxation. This way, employees get more focused on work after unloading the stress. Offering several types of PTO leaves to employees provides an apparent reason for taking the leaves by employees. And due to this, the organization can better understand the employee’s situation. The company can further track the leaves taken the maximum number of times. Also, companies should include paid time offs in their policy to provide better flexibility to employees. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account How can Truein help?
