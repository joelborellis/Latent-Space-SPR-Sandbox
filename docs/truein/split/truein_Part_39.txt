With a first-in and last-out system? Well, that’s perfect for most employees, not all employees. There are times when you want to calculate the actual time spent at work. Not sure what that means? Let’s look at these examples. Table of Contents Scenario One: How can Truein help? Scenario Two: How can Truein help? Diverse system for your diverse needs Scenario One: Imagine your employee comes to work at 9 a.m. and realises he needs to head back home for an emergency. He attends to his emergency chores and comes back at 2:00 p.m. He finishes his work day at 6:00 p.m. and punches out on the attendance system. With the first-in and last-out system, you would see full-day attendance, even when he wasn’t in for half-day. That’s not what you want. How can Truein help? Truein face attendance can track every in and every out in the system and can be configured to calculate time between them. For example, when the employee comes in at 9:00 a.m. and leaves at 9:15 a.m., only 15 minutes get counted. When he is back at 2:00 p.m., the time count starts again. What’s more? An Admin in the Truein portal can override the system calculations if the manager decides to allow a paid time-off . And the logs of the ins and outs stay in the system, always. So if you need an audit trail, you are covered. Scenario Two: Imagine a sales representative moving from one area to another to complete his sales calls. He may mark his attendance at the office in the morning, but end his day with a punch at the distributor’s office in another location. Will the system be able to reconcile his attendance marks at different locations? If not, he may be marked absent and will lose his day’s pay. The situation gets even more complicated if he marks attendance from the Mumbai office for half a month and remaining time from the Chennai office. How can Truein help? Truein can be configured to create multiple site points – one at head office and another at distributor’s office. Attendance at any location will be counted and used for the purpose of compiling work hours. Truein in one-system with the flexibility to have multiple site points with their own rules. If there are site points across regions – Mumbai and Chennai for instance, each site can have their own set of holidays, sick leave rules or overtime policy . The admin does not have to do any manual reconciliation. The system tracks all site points and compiles reports. Diverse system for your diverse needs Configure the Truein face attendance system to match the unique needs of your organization. Customise the system for every branch, every region, every department based on what your system or employees needs are. You don’t have to have one rule – First in, last out for everyone. And you don’t have to do manual tallies across regions. Let Truein intelligently handle it for you! Enjoy the power of attendance automation .

Companies need such labor for flexibility and to aid full-time workers, especially when the project demands too much workforce. In a dynamic economy like the Middle East, you need temp construction labor to scale the workforce up or down based on project requirements. This approach offers numerous benefits, including cost-effectiveness and the ability to access specialized skills for specific tasks. While temporary construction labor offers several benefits, it still needs challenges. From ensuring consistent quality of work to maintaining safety standards and complying with local labor laws, construction companies must know how to manage temporary construction staff effectively.  That’s what this article is about; we will explore the challenges faced when managing a temporary workforce in construction and provide best practices for enhancing efficiency. Table of Contents What Is Seasonal Employment? Challenges in Managing Seasonal/Temporary Construction Workers Demand fluctuations High turnover and inconsistent skill levels Complexities in scheduling and coordination Compliance with labor laws and regulations Ensuring safety and training for short-term hires Budgetary constraints Best Practices for Efficiently Managing Temporary and Seasonal Employees Plan Ahead for Peak Seasons Streamline Recruitment and Onboarding Managing Schedules and Time Off Define Job Expectations Implement Flexible Workforce Scheduling Prioritize Training and Safety Use Technology to Track Attendance and Performance Ensure Clear Communication and Coordination Offer Constructive Criticism Compliance with Labor Laws and Regulations The Benefits of Efficient Temporary Worker Management Improved productivity and project completion times Cost savings by reducing administrative overhead Building a pool of skilled temporary workers for future projects How does Truein help with time & attendance tracking and shift scheduling? Conclusion What Is Seasonal Employment? In the construction industry, seasonal employment refers to hiring labor for specific periods, typically during peak construction seasons or for particular projects. In the Middle East, construction companies must choose their working hours wisely due to the brutal heat and adverse weather conditions. Therefore, in the Middle East, the increased project demands align with periods of more favorable weather conditions. This leads to seasonal employment trends, which results in demand for temporary construction labor around specific periods. Seasonal workers are distinct from permanent employees, who are hired for a predetermined duration. Such workers know their employment will end once the season or project concludes. Challenges in Managing Seasonal/Temporary Construction Workers For construction companies, managing seasonal/temporary construction labor requires anticipating challenges that can arise and proactively addressing them. Here are the most common challenges construction companies can face: Demand fluctuations Construction projects are notorious for varying demands throughout different phases. You require different types and numbers of workers depending on the project phase. For instance, the foundation phase might need more general laborers, while later stages could require specialized technicians. Similarly, seasonal fluctuations in construction activity, market volatility, and project overlaps can cause demand fluctuations. High turnover and inconsistent skill levels The transient nature of temporary work presents another challenge. This presents hiring challenges due to frequent workforce changes and varying levels of expertise among workers. One batch of temp laborers might not be as skilled as the others. Complexities in scheduling and coordination Balancing the schedules of temporary workers with project timelines can be logistically challenging. Temporary construction workers often commit to more than one project, which makes it difficult to have any flexibility in their schedules. This also makes it challenging to coordinate the availability of specialized temporary construction staff with specific project phases. Compliance with labor laws and regulations Ensuring adherence to local labor laws, particularly in the Middle East, is difficult. Labor laws can vary significantly between different Middle Eastern countries. It requires construction companies to be well-versed in multiple regulatory environments, as regulations for temporary workers can be strict. Ensuring safety and training for short-term hires Construction work is a high-risk avenue, which is why workers should be trained about safety protocols. However, maintaining high safety standards and providing adequate training for workers who may only be on-site for a short period is not economically feasible. The challenge is to ensure safety and training for short-term hires within budget constraints. Budgetary constraints Managing labor costs effectively while working with temporary construction labor presents unforeseen variables. Due to the high turnover, demand fluctuations, and skill inconsistencies, ensuring project quality and timelines are met within budget becomes complex. Best Practices for Efficiently Managing Temporary and Seasonal Employees Now that we know the challenges associated with temp construction labor, let’s explore how some of the largest construction companies manage these challenges. Plan Ahead for Peak Seasons You cannot be proactive enough with seasonal workers. As mentioned, construction activities in the Middle East face a unique seasonal fluctuation, but it is easy to anticipate. For effective management of temporary construction staff, construction companies should analyze historical data to predict labor needs for upcoming seasons. Then, based on project timeline and budget, they can contact reliable sources of temporary construction labor to ensure quick access to qualified workers when needed. Streamline Recruitment and Onboarding With efficient recruitment and onboarding processes, you can quickly address any challenges integrating temporary construction labor into ongoing projects. To achieve this, software tools such as HR and payroll can streamline recruitment, allowing for quick identification and hiring of suitable candidates. To minimize the onboarding time, tailor the process for temporary workers. For instance, onboarding can cover essential company policies, safety procedures, and project-specific information and skip through the payment or overtime regulations that concern permanent employees. Managing Schedules and Time Off Seasonal labor in the construction industry poses challenges that require effective schedule management. To overcome the challenges of a fluctuating workforce, implement a clear policy for requesting time off, ensuring it aligns with project needs. This has to be customized for each project. You can use scheduling software to manage shifts efficiently, accounting for worker availability and project requirements. Define Job Expectations There is no scope for confusion; the temporary construction labor must know their role and job duties to maximize efficiency. Have detailed job descriptions outlining tasks, performance expectations, and project timelines. Managers should conduct brief orientation sessions to familiarize temporary workers with their roles and responsibilities within the larger project scope. Implement Flexible Workforce Scheduling Flexibility, as well as the fluctuation in season workforce scheduling, can be minimized by utilizing technology. Scheduling software can significantly enhance efficiency by allocating labor based on project timelines and skill requirements. Such systems allow for easy adjustments to schedules as project needs evolve. Choose a scheduling system that can integrate with other time-tracking tools for seamless management of hours worked and payroll processing. Prioritize Training and Safety The safety of the temporary construction staff is closely associated with the safety of the permanent workers and the entire project. Therefore, maintaining high safety standards and ensuring adequate training for temporary workers is paramount. However, you cannot offer seasonal/temporary construction workers a full-scale training program. You should develop short but focused safety and skill training programs tailored for new hires based on their job-specific skills. Use Technology to Track Attendance and Performance Tracking time and attendance of temp construction labor is crucial for managing the workforce and keeping labor costs in check. Adopt time-tracking tools and attendance software to record work hours and ensure compliance with labor regulations accurately. Modern time and attendance systems like Truein have GPS geofencing features and central management capabilities. It allows managers to record, track, and monitor the time and attendance of construction workers across several sites from a central dashboard. These tools feature robust analytics capabilities too. Features like mobile apps take worker communication and task management to the next level, allowing for real-time updates and efficient coordination. Additionally, utilizing HR and workforce management software can ease handling seasonal hires infinitely.  These systems automate the onboarding process, including document collection and verification. Managing payroll and benefits administration for temporary workers becomes much easier due to the high automation of processes. Furthermore, they facilitate compliance with labor laws by maintaining accurate work hours, breaks, and overtime records. Ensure Clear Communication and Coordination Effective communication is critical to managing temporary construction staff. There must be clear lines of communication between managers, supervisors, and temporary workers. Construction companies should implement mobile apps or platforms that allow real-time updates on project changes, safety alerts, or task assignments. Establish protocols for conducting regular briefings or toolbox talks to keep all workers informed of project progress and upcoming tasks. Offer Constructive Criticism Temporary workers may not perform up to the mark initially. To bring them up to speed and improve performance, conduct regular performance reviews, even for short-term workers. Based on the feedback, offer constructive feedback promptly, focusing on specific behaviours or skills that can be improved. Ensuring Legal Compliance Regardless of what tools you utilize or protocols you implement, ensure that all your activities adhere to legal requirements. This is crucial when managing temporary construction labor. Stay informed about local labor laws and regulations regarding temporary workers in the Middle East. It includes ensuring all contracts and payment structures comply with legal requirements and maintain accurate work hours records. Compliance with Labor Laws and Regulations Compliance with labor laws and regulations regarding temporary construction labor in the Middle East can be much more challenging. The region is formed by several countries, each with its own set of labor laws. Contracts and Payments : Ensure all employment contracts for temporary workers meet local labor law requirements. Arabic is the only legal and acceptable language for contracts in the Middle East. You can provide workers with a translated contract copy, but only Arabic copies are permissible in court. Also, contracts must have clear stipulations such as duration, working hours, overtime rates, and termination conditions. Visas and Permits: The visa and work permit requirements for temporary workers vary depending on the regions of the Middle East. Each country has specific regulations, for instance: UAE: Temporary work permits have a maximum validity of six months. Saudi Arabia: Short-term work visas are available in the country, which allows holders to work up to 90 days. Qatar: Temporary work visas can be issued for up to 90 days. The documentation requirement for visas and permits will vary depending on the type of skill and employment. Health and Safety Regulations: Construction companies must adhere to health and safety regulations in the Middle East. This includes: Provide mandatory safety training to all temporary workers before they start working for the company. Providing proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and ensuring workers wear them while working. Conduct regular safety inspections and address any safety hazards or issues promptly. The Benefits of Efficient Temporary Worker Management Construction companies can benefit by implementing the best practices for managing temporary construction staff. Improved productivity and project completion times Companies can efficiently allocate labor resources based on project needs with effective temp construction labor management. This boosts productivity and reduces downtime due to better scheduling and task management. Furthermore, you can quickly scale the workforce up or down as project demands change. Cost savings by reducing administrative overhead Construction companies can optimize workforce management processes by utilizing time and attendance management tools and HR software. It results in a reduction in administrative overhead through streamlined processes. It optimizes the labor cost by matching the workforce to actual project needs. Building a pool of skilled temporary workers for future projects When tracking productivity and monitoring project requirements, you can always identify and retain high-performing temporary workers for future projects. You do not have to depend on an external source. You can create a database of skilled workers with specific expertise for quick deployment. It will help you improve work quality through consistent skills and performance. How does Truein help with time & attendance tracking and shift scheduling?
