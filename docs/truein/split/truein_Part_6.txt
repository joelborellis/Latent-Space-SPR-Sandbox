Yes, there is, and you can add the kiosk devices from the Web Dashboard. There are several reasons why a workplace may require multiple kiosks.

Activity punch is a feature in Truein that allows staff members to indicate a specific activity or task they have performed, such as a client meeting or a visit to a vendor’s place. When a staff member performs an activity, they can do a single punch using the Activity feature, which captures the time and location of the activity. It is important to note that the activity punch does not interfere with the regular IN/OUT times of the staff member for that day.
