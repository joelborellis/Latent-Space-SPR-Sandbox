It includes tracking when employees start and end their workday and monitoring breaks, overtime, and absences. Modern-time attendance management systems have come a long way from the traditional punch cards. Today, cloud-based time and attendance solutions like Truein have evolved into sophisticated software offering many features and benefits. Features of Time & Attendance Systems While the features offered can vary, most modern time attendance software typically include: Biometric-based time tracking Modern solutions use biometric scanners for accurate real-time attendance. This includes using fingerprint recognition or facial recognition for clock-ins and clock-outs. This approach ensures that the time and attendance tracking is precise and tamper-proof. Web-based interfaces for easy access and management Cloud-based time attendance solutions allow managers and administrators to access the system from anywhere with an internet connection. This feature is precious in the Middle East, where businesses operate across multiple locations. Real-time reporting capabilities Modern time and attendance systems have notifications that provide instant updates on employee clock-ins, absences, and overtime. They also have advanced reporting tools to generate customized reports on various metrics such as labour costs, attendance trends, and productivity analysis. For example, some systems can produce heat maps showing peak attendance times, helping managers optimize staffing levels. Integration with payroll and HR systems Robust attendance software offers seamless integration capabilities. Tools like Truein ensure that attendance data flows automatically into payroll and HR systems. This reduces manual data entry and errors and significantly reduces payroll processing time. Employee self-service app Due to their mobile app and self-service portal features, these systems empower employees to manage their own time-related tasks. This reduces the administrative burden on HR departments as employees can view their work schedules, request time off and check their leave balances. Benefits of Time and Attendance Systems for Employers Implementing a time and attendance system for your business in the Middle East offers numerous advantages. Adoption of such a workforce management system benefits both employers and employees. Accurate Time Tracking Time attendance solutions use sophisticated algorithms for precise records of work hours. It eliminates errors associated with manual timekeeping and significantly reduces the risk of time theft. Efficient Payroll Integration The accurate time and attendance data can be automatically shared with the payroll systems. Advanced time and attendance systems streamline the payroll process, ensuring employees are paid accurately and on time. Enhanced Job Satisfaction Employee attendance systems eliminate manual errors and schedule disputes, give workers more control over their time, and reduce the frustration associated with timesheet disputes. Access to Self-Service Tools Many attendance software solutions offer employee self-service tools such as mobile apps where workers can view their schedules, request time off, and access their attendance records. Support for Compliance and Fairness Time and attendance management systems have built-in compliance adherence features. It helps ensure fair treatment of all employees and supports compliance with labor laws and company policies. Ease of Use Modern-time attendance devices are user-friendly. Advanced systems often feature intuitive interfaces that simplify the clock-in/clock-out process, unlike manual methods requiring filling timesheets. Feedback and Communication The two-way communication channels built into the staff attendance management systems facilitate better interaction between employees and management. Why Time and Attendance Systems are Essential in the Middle East There are some unique challenges that businesses in the Middle East face, and an advanced time attendance system helps overcome these issues. There are several reasons to consider a time and attendance management system: Regional Challenges The Middle East is rapidly diversifying in terms of economic growth. The unique challenges presented make time and attendance systems particularly valuable: Diverse workforce demographics and remote locations: As most of the workforce in the Middle Eastern economies are migrants, the time and attendance system helps businesses manage a diverse workforce, often in remote or scattered locations. Regulatory diversity across Middle Eastern countries: Each region has labour laws and regulations. Without geographical border restrictions, most businesses operate in multiple countries, making compliance complex for businesses. Time and attendance systems make embracing regulatory diversity easier. Unique considerations: The harsh climate in some parts of the Middle East can impact worker attendance and productivity. For instance, traditional bulky attendance machines can easily get overheated or fingerprint sensors rendered unresponsive due to dust. Modern face recognition attendance systems can operate out of workers’ smartphones, overcoming these challenges. Compliance and Regulation Time and attendance systems play a crucial role in helping businesses comply with regional labour laws. For instance, the United Arab Emirates’ Wage Protection System (WPS) requires companies to pay salaries through approved financial institutions, making accurate time tracking essential for correct and timely wage payments. Time and attendance systems help ensure compliance. Cultural Factors Modern attendance systems are highly customizable. It makes that adaptable to local work cultures and practices. For example, they can accommodate prayer times and extended breaks during Ramadan, essential considerations in many Middle Eastern countries. Key Features of Effective Time and Attendance Systems Whether you are exploring a new time and attendance system or want to upgrade your existing system, there are some key features that you must look for: Integration Capabilities Any time and attendance systems you choose must seamlessly integrate with existing HR, payroll, and ERP systems. It ensures data consistency across all platforms and saves time and cost. Mobile Access With the increasing prevalence of remote work and field-based employees, mobile attendance apps for workers have become essential. Mobile access allows employees to clock in and out, request time off, and access their schedules from anywhere. Reporting and Analytics Advanced reporting and analytics tools must be included in the time attendance software. It will provide valuable insights into workforce productivity, overtime trends, and attendance patterns, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency. Customization Options Time attendance solutions should be flexible enough to tailor to your business needs or industry requirements. For example, a system should be able to accommodate atypical shift work or manage multiple locations. Facial Authentication Biometric features like facial recognition add an extra layer of security and accuracy to employee attendance systems. Facial authentication prevents buddy punching and ensures that the right person is at the right job. Cloud-Based Solutions Cloud-based time and attendance software offers the advantages of accessibility, scalability, and reduced IT infrastructure costs. Such systems are highly robust and can be scaled as your business grows. Geofencing Geofencing is a feature that allows creating a virtual boundary to ensure workers are present at the work site during shifts. This feature in attendance apps for workers ensures that employees can only clock in when they’re within a specified geographic area, which is particularly useful for businesses with multiple locations or field-based staff. Automated Alerts and Notifications Real-time alerts and notifications system in attendance software can send alerts to managers about late arrivals, absences, or overtime, allowing for quick action and better workforce management. Compliance Management Advanced time and attendance management systems include features to help businesses stay compliant with local labor laws and company policies. Choosing the Right Time and Attendance Software for Your Business The choice of the time and attendance software should be based on your business requirements; there are certain fundamental aspects to consider: Assessing Your Needs Before selecting a time attendance system for your business, it’s crucial to identify your requirements. The most important factors to consider include: The size of your workforce The nature of your business (e.g., office-based, fieldwork, shift work) Specific industry regulations Integration needs with existing systems Comparing Solutions There is more than one solution available for businesses in the Middle East. Research and compare various time and attendance solutions available and look for systems that offer the features most relevant to your business needs. Some popular options include: a. Truein : A cloud-based solution with advanced facial recognition technology designed to meet the diverse needs of businesses in the region. b. MENA HR : More of a comprehensive HR management system, it offers integrated time and attendance features that are tailored for Middle Eastern companies. c.

You must not select a vendor who cannot provide regular updates or timely support for the system. Consider a vendor who offers reliability and uptime guarantees. Check the quality of customer support, particularly the availability of local support in the Middle East. Also, check user reviews and testimonials before making a final decision. Scalability Ensure the time attendance solution you choose can grow with your business. In this context, cloud-based time and attendance systems offer maximum scalability. Any solution you select should be able to handle an increasing number of employees and additional features as your needs evolve. User-Friendliness Lastly, the attendance software should be intuitive and easy for employees and administrators. A user-friendly interface can significantly reduce training time and increase adoption rates. Mobile Time Tracking App Modern time and attendance systems often offer mobile apps. A robust attendance app for workers is essential as these apps allow employees to clock in and out, request time off, and view their schedules from their smartphones. In the Middle East, where many businesses operate across multiple locations or employ field-based workers, mobile time tracking apps support real-time attendance tracking, allowing managers to stay updated on employee whereabouts and hours worked. It is recommended that when choosing a time attendance solution, prioritize one that offers a comprehensive, user-friendly mobile app to ensure maximum flexibility and efficiency for your workforce. Implementation of the Time and Attendance System Once you have picked a time and attendance system, its implementation should also have a strategic approach. Here are the steps to follow: Planning and Preparation Create a detailed implementation plan. It should include a comprehensive timeline for roll-out, preferably one department at a time. Also, training schedules for employees and administrators should be included in the planning. Prepare a communication strategy to inform staff about the new system. Monitoring and Adjustment A pilot program for implementation is better as it provides an opportunity to continuously monitor the time attendance system’s performance and gather user feedback. It gives you time to be prepared to make adjustments as needed to optimize the system’s effectiveness. Customization and Configuration Select a vendor to customize the time and attendance solution to your business needs. For instance, setting up unique pay rules or configuring the system to handle multiple shifts. Pilot Testing As mentioned, consider running a pilot test with a small group of employees before full implementation. Many vendors, including Truein, offer free trials that allow you to test the system in your specific environment. Feedback Collection Regularly collect feedback from employees and managers to ensure that the time attendance software meets your business needs. This will help identify any issues early. Integration with Other Systems Ensure smooth integration with your existing HR, payroll, and ERP systems to maximize the benefits of your new time and attendance management system.

Particularly in manufacturing, construction, retail, and mining, these workers make up the backbone of a business. “Blue Collar” typically refers to working-class workers. From construction, manufacturing, and transportation to maintenance, these workers engage in manual labor, often requiring specialized skills, training, and experience. The importance of blue collar workers cannot be overstated. However, blue collar management is anything but simple. Managing such a workforce presents unique challenges compared to managing white-collar or office-based staff. Communication barriers due to language differences, varying education levels, high turnover rates, seasonal fluctuations in demand, and the need for continuous training and development complicate the management of blue collar workers. Managing blue collar employees is crucial for ensuring productivity, safety, job satisfaction, and overall organizational success, so we have created this guide on managing blue collar workers. Here, we will discuss the knowledge and tools necessary to manage the blue collar workforce successfully. Table of Contents Management Styles for Blue Collar Employees Authoritative Management Participative Management (Democratic) Transformational Management Transactional Management Servant Leadership Laissez-Faire Management Contingency Theory Key Principles for Successfully Managing Blue collar Workers Common Challenges in Managing Blue collar Workers Frequent changing staff & Contractual Workforce Turnover Adhering to Safety Regulations Problems with attendance tracking & shift scheduling Overcoming Communication Challenges Providing Effective Training and Development Managing Attendance and Timeliness How Truein Can Assist in Improving Workforce Management for Blue collar Employees? Conclusion Management Styles for Blue Collar Employees Fortunately, employers can use several management styles to manage blue collar workers. Here, we discuss some of the most influential management styles. Authoritative Management Also called autocratic leadership, authoritative management is a top-down approach where managers make decisions and provide clear directives to employees. This blue collar management style is categorized by a high degree of control. Managers utilizing this management style display full responsibility for decision-making and expect employees to follow instructions without question. The benefits of an authoritative management style are realized in high-pressure or time-sensitive situations, such as construction projects with tight deadlines or emergency maintenance work. As this management style ensures quick decision-making, maintains control, and provides clear guidance to employees, it is best to deal with new or less experienced workers. For authoritative management to be effective, managers must clearly communicate expectations, provide necessary resources and support, and consistently enforce rules and procedures. For example, given a tight deadline, a construction site manager can use an authoritative approach by clearly outlining tasks, setting strict schedules, and closely monitoring progress. Participative Management (Democratic) As the term suggests, participative management encourages employee involvement in decision-making processes. Democratic management style fosters a sense of ownership, collaboration, and shared responsibility among blue collar workers. When managers actively seek input from workers and consider their suggestions, it boosts morale, creativity, and problem-solving skills among blue collar workers. To ensure the success of participative management, managers should regularly seek input from employees, facilitate open discussions, and genuinely consider their suggestions when making decisions. Suppose a manufacturing plant manager notices a decline in productivity and increased employee turnover. Here, an authoritative management style will be hardly effective. Instead, a participative approach, such as holding weekly meetings to hear workers’ ideas for process improvements and discuss challenges they face, will be more effective. Transformational Management Transformational management focuses on inspiring and motivating employees to achieve shared business goals. This management style can also be referred to as leading by example. Transformational managers act as role models, stimulating creativity, innovation, and a strong sense of purpose among blue collar workers. Transformational management builds a strong sense of commitment, which results in loyalty among blue collar workers. This style of managing blue collar workers increases employee engagement and encourages workers to take ownership of their roles. To effectively practice transformational management, managers should recognize individual strengths and contributions and provide opportunities for growth and development. An example of transformational management is when managers use it to handle workers who feel disconnected from the company’s goals and lack motivation. By communicating the organization’s vision and how each team member’s role contributes to its success, supervisors can encourage workers to develop new skills, take on additional responsibilities, and propose innovative solutions. Transactional Management This style of managing blue collar workers relies on rewards and punishments to motivate employees. It most suits short-term goals, emphasizing work exchange for compensation and benefits. Transactional management is helpful when adhering to rules, maintaining consistency, and achieving specific targets, which are more important than long-term inclusivity. For the success of this management style, managers should set clear, measurable goals, provide timely feedback, and consistently apply rewards and consequences. Transportation companies usually use transactional management to ensure compliance with safety regulations and meet delivery targets. They set clear performance metrics, such as on-time delivery rates and safety scores, and offer bonuses for meeting or exceeding these targets. Servant Leadership Servant leadership prioritizes employees’ needs, growth, and well-being over business goals. It is based on supporting, empowering, and developing blue collar workers to help them reach their full potential. Servant leadership can foster a positive, trust-based work environment, increase employee engagement, and promote loyalty among blue collar workers. For effectiveness, servant leaders should lead by example, demonstrating empathy, humility, and a commitment to the success of their team members. For instance, if a maintenance supervisor notices several team members struggle with work-life balance and personal challenges, he can take a servant leadership approach. He can regularly check in with each team member to understand their needs and concerns and provide solutions. Laissez-Faire Management Laissez-faire management, or delegation leadership, involves providing employees significant autonomy in their work. This style of managing blue collar workers requires managers to provide minimal direct supervision. Laissez-faire management is applicable when managers work with highly skilled, experienced, and self-motivated blue collar workers. However, managers must ensure workers have the necessary skills, knowledge, and resources to work independently to apply laissez-faire management. Construction site managers can benefit from this approach when overseeing a team of experienced electricians, plumbers, and carpenters. Recognizing the expertise and self-sufficiency of these workers, the managers can adopt a laissez-faire approach and inform the team about project goals and deadlines. The rest of the team members can determine the best methods and schedules for completing the work. Contingency Theory Contingency theory suggests that there are only so many best management styles. The theory put forward the idea that the most effective way to manage blue collar workers depends on the situation, the characteristics of the employees, and the nature of the work. Contingency theory allows managers to tailor their approach to different situations and individuals’ unique challenges and opportunities. To effectively apply contingency theory, managers should be aware of different management styles and choose the appropriate one after assessing the situation. For example, a construction project manager overseeing multiple teams can employ different blue collar worker management styles depending on the skill levels, experience, and personalities. Key Principles for Successfully Managing Blue collar Workers You understand the management styles, but familiarity with the fundamental principles is essential to implement blue collar management strategies successfully. Let’s find out what these key principles are. Effective Communication Irrespective of your chosen management style, it will only be effective with proper communication. That is why clear communication is essential for managing blue collar workers. There are a few techniques managers can utilize to ensure effective communication. Ensuring regular flow of communication by holding regular meetings to discuss goals, challenges, and updates. Establish and maintain open channels for feedback and questions from workers. Whenever possible, provide written instructions and visual aids to ease understanding. Training and Development As mentioned, blue collar workers often are involved in manual labour, requiring continuous training. A training and development program is crucial to maintain and enhance the skills of these workers. For practical training, managers can take several approaches depending on the nature of the job and the skill level required. On-the-job training with experienced mentors is highly effective when dealing with blue collar workers who need specialized skills. Additionally, employers can arrange and provide access to relevant certifications and workshops to train workers. For a versatile workforce, encouraging cross-training is essential. Safety First Prioritizing safety is essential in blue collar work environments. Most workers are employed in hazardous activities, and ensuring safety is critical for uninterrupted business operations. The strategies for promoting and maintaining a safe workplace include providing proper safety equipment and training to blue collar workers. Furthermore, employers should regularly conduct safety audits and promptly address identified hazards. Companies with the highest safety records usually encourage a safety culture through incentives and recognition. Motivation and Engagement Blue collar workers usually handle repetitive tasks and can burn out quickly if not motivated and engaged. That’s why motivating blue collar workers is critical to maintaining productivity and job satisfaction. How to motivate blue collar workers? Well, there are more than one technique for motivation: The easiest but not necessarily viable approach for all businesses is to offer performance-based incentives and bonuses. To encourage self-motivation and inspire other workers, implementing recognition programs to acknowledge exceptional work is highly effective. Another technique is to foster a positive work environment through team-building activities and open communication. Building Trust and Respect Trust and respect are essential for a productive and harmonious workplace. Successful businesses rely on something other than churning out blue collar workers in batches one after another; instead, they focus on a high retention rate. Building trust and respect is one of the ways to retain blue collar workers. You can build trust and ensure respect by leading by example and demonstrating integrity. When employers treat all employees fairly and consistently, it sends a clear message of trust and respect. Furthermore, managers must acknowledge and address concerns promptly and professionally. Leveraging Technology When your organization highly depends on blue-collar workers, you can only expect to manage them by successfully leveraging technology. Solutions like Truein can streamline workforce management for blue collar employees. For example, attendance tracking systems can monitor and manage the schedules of blue collar workers at multiple sites. Also, employers can leverage mobile communication platforms for real-time updates and coordination. More advanced capabilities include utilizing data analytics technology to identify blue collar management trends and optimize processes. Common Challenges in Managing Blue collar Workers Frequent changing staff & Contractual Workforce Turnover Industries relying on blue collar workers often face high turnover rates due to the physical nature of the work. Another reason is the prevalence of contractual or temporary positions. Offering competitive wages and benefits and providing opportunities for growth and development can reduce turnover. Adhering to Safety Regulations When workers are distributed over sites, ensuring compliance with safety regulations can be challenging in blue collar work environments. Managers can ensure safety in the workplace by regularly updating and communicating safety policies and procedures. Also, providing ongoing safety training and reinforcement is effective. Problems with attendance tracking & shift scheduling Managing attendance and scheduling can be complex, particularly with large or distributed blue collar workforces. Implementing automated attendance tracking systems like Truein can minimize attendance and shift scheduling challenges. Overcoming Communication Challenges As discussed earlier, language barriers, cultural differences, and varying education levels can hinder effective communication when blue collar workers are involved. Large organizations handle this challenge by providing multilingual training materials and resources and encouraging open communication and active listening. Providing Effective Training and Development Ensuring blue collar workers receive adequate training at the workplace can be challenging due to time constraints and production demands. The solution lies in developing structured on-the-job training programs by leveraging online learning platforms for flexible skill development. Managing Attendance and Timeliness Blue collar management is also complex due to the large number of workers, which makes it challenging to ensure timeliness. A cloud-based attendance and time-tracking system can help overcome this challenge. How Truein Can Assist in Improving Workforce Management for Blue collar Employees?

It is no surprise that you are in the cleaning business. However, challenges arise when you have to handle many cleaning staff. Managing cleaning staff is critical to maintaining a clean, hygienic, and well-functioning environment in any setting, whether a commercial office, a residential building, or a public space. The Middle East is known for its high standards of cleanliness and hygiene. It is not just behaviour but an act deeply rooted in the region’s cultural and religious traditions. Managing cleaning staff in the Middle East presents challenges, such as navigating cultural norms, adhering to legal standards, and managing work permits and visas for foreign workers. This article will explore the key strategies and best practices for managing cleaning staff in the Middle East. Table of Contents Adhering to Legal Standards Managing Work Permits and Visas Understanding Local Context and Regulations Communication and Team Building Scheduling and Shift Management Managing Shift Adjustments Considering Cultural Needs Technology and Tools Leveraging Technology for Efficiency Investing in Modern Cleaning Equipment Training and Development Initial Training Requirements Ongoing Skill Development Health and Safety Education Performance Management Defining Performance Expectations Evaluating Staff Performance Addressing Performance Issues Managing Diverse Teams Embracing Cultural Diversity Effective Communication Strategies Building Team Cohesion Employee Well-being and Motivation Ensuring Health and Safety Strategies for Employee Motivation Supporting Work-Life Balance Legal and Ethical Considerations Upholding Fair Labor Practices Handling Employee Complaints How does Truein Help with Workforce Management and Attendance? Conclusion Adhering to Legal Standards The Middle East has specific legal standards and regulations that govern employment practices, including those related to cleaning staff. Management of cleaning staff requires employers to adhere to employment standards, such as minimum wage requirements, working hours limitations, and health and safety regulations. Managing Work Permits and Visas As the majority of the cleaning staff in the Middle East are foreigners, visas and work permits are required. Employers must know how to obtain and renew these documents and ensure all staff members have valid licenses and visas. This involves working closely with Middle Eastern government authorities and staying up-to-date on any changes to immigration policies. Understanding Local Context and Regulations Compared to Western culture, the Middle East proudly maintains its religious and traditional values. Cleaning staff should be well-versed in the region’s cultural norms, including religious practices such as prayer times and holidays. Managers can enhance workplace harmony by understanding and respecting gender roles, adhering to the Middle East’s guidelines on interactions between men and women. Additionally, adjusting work schedules and expectations to align with local norms, such as avoiding disturbances during prayer times, ensures a respectful and cohesive work environment. Embracing these cultural practices fosters mutual respect and smooth operations. Communication and Team Building Clear and effective communication becomes vital when working with a diverse team. In the Middle East, cleaning teams are comprised of staff from different language backgrounds. Communication can be a challenge. Here are some steps to take Effective Communication Techniques Clean staff managers should use simple and direct language. Also, instructions can be shared in multiple formats, such as written and verbal, to ensure understanding. Offering translation services when necessary will encourage open communication among staff members. Building a Cohesive Team A cohesive team shares a sense of unity and purpose among staff members, regardless of their cultural backgrounds or language abilities. While it might seem insignificant, simple activities like regular team-building activities like group meetings and recognition programs can go a long way. Handling Conflicts and Promoting Collaboration Conflicts will happen when your cleaning staff has such a diverse workforce. Conflicts can arise in any workplace, and managing cleaning staff is no exception. It is the responsibility of managers to identify and address conflicts proactively. Some steps they can take include promoting open communication, active listening, and collaborative problem-solving. Scheduling and Shift Management Creating schedules that consider the specific needs of each facility, as well as the preferences and availability of individual staff members, is essential. For this purpose, you can use shift scheduling software like Truein to optimize shifts and ensure adequate coverage. Managing Shift Adjustments Your cleaning staff might be accustomed to the same work schedule yearly due to their nationality. Still, in the Middle East, it is common for work schedules to be adjusted during certain times, such as during Ramadan or other religious holidays. Employers must account for these adjustments and communicate any schedule changes to staff members in advance. Creating flexible working arrangements to accommodate the changing needs of staff members is the ideal solution. Considering Cultural Needs In the Middle East, the demand and expectations for cleaning staff change dramatically during specific periods. For example, during Ramadan, many staff members may prefer to work evening or night shifts to accommodate fasting during daylight hours. Even in the Middle East, the government has norms regarding work hours for Muslim employees during Ramadan. For instance, fasting workers are not allowed outside work from 11 am to 4 pm during Ramadan. It is also essential to provide appropriate break times and prayer spaces for staff members to fulfill their religious obligations. Technology and Tools You can only expect to manage your cleaning staff by leveraging technology in some way or another. There are several segments where technological tools can be helpful. Leveraging Technology for Efficiency One key efficiency area in managing cleaning staff where technology can help is scheduling and attendance tracking. Using cloud-based scheduling tools such as Truein, managers can create and adjust real-time schedules, ensuring that shifts are always adequately staffed. Attendance tracking systems can also help managers monitor staff punctuality and identify any issues with absenteeism or tardiness. Investing in Modern Cleaning Equipment Your cleaning staff will be as efficient and productive as the tools you provide them. You must invest in modern cleaning equipment and tools to manage your cleaning staff and be more productive than your competitors. These tools help your cleaning staff work more effectively and reduce the time and effort required to complete tasks. Training and Development Skills are necessary for any cleaning business to succeed in the Middle East. As mentioned, the region is quite adamant about cleaning standards, so your staff will need training to adapt to the cleaning demands. Initial Training Requirements Providing comprehensive initial training to ensure that all staff members have the knowledge and skills needed to perform their duties effectively is the first step in managing cleaning staff in the Middle East. Typically, the initial training includes teaching proper cleaning techniques, safety protocols, and specific equipment and tools. Ongoing Skill Development To stay afloat in the cleaning business in the Middle East, your staff will need ongoing opportunities for skill development and professional growth. Some staff members will require ongoing training more than others. Also, regular training sessions on new cleaning techniques must be provided as you induct new-age cleaning equipment. Additionally, workshops or seminars on customer service, teamwork, and leadership will improve your clean staff’s skills. Health and Safety Education Given the physical nature of cleaning work, managers must prioritize the health and safety of cleaning staff. Therefore, health and safety education is a must to train employees on proper ergonomics, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the handling of hazardous materials. Performance Management A discussion on managing cleaning staff is only complete with discussing performance management. Managers should communicate work expectations clearly and provide regular feedback to help cleaning staff understand how they perform relative to these goals. Defining Performance Expectations How can you measure your cleaning staff’s performance if you still need to define performance expectations clearly? Specifying performance key performance indicators includes setting specific, measurable goals for each staff member. It outlines the standards of quality and productivity that are expected from them. Evaluating Staff Performance That can be measured and improved. This applies to regular performance evaluations for managing cleaning staff in the Middle East. Such evaluations allow managers to share constructive feedback with the cleaning staff and let them know areas for improvement. These evaluations should be based on objective criteria, such as attendance, punctuality, quality of work, and adherence to safety protocols. Addressing Performance Issues You may have to handle performance issues among the cleaning staff. Such issues must be addressed promptly and directly. You may have to provide additional training or support to help staff members improve their skills. In the worst case, taking disciplinary action in cases of repeated or serious performance problems. Managing Diverse Teams As mentioned, the Middle East cleaning staff is a demographic of diverse nationalities, cultures, and languages. Managing cleaning staff in the country requires a more inclusive approach. Embracing Cultural Diversity The diversity of cultural backgrounds and nationalities represented on most teams is something unique to managing cleaning staff in the Middle East. You can only effectively manage this diversity by embracing and celebrating unique perspectives and experiences. Effective Communication Strategies Effective communication is essential at any step of managing cleaning staff. Managers should use clear, simple language and provide instructions in multiple formats, such as written and visual aids, to ensure that all cleaning staff understand and follow them. Building Team Cohesion It might seem insignificant initially, but building a solid and cohesive team becomes critical for any cleaning operation when the cultural environment is diverse. If you can create a sense of shared purpose and identity among cleaning staff members, regardless of their cultural backgrounds, things will be relatively easy. Employee Well-being and Motivation In the Middle East, concerns over the health and safety of domestic cleaning staff are often in the limelight for all the wrong reasons. You do not want your business to be counted as one where cleaning staff are treated inhumanely. Ensuring Health and Safety The physical demands of cleaning work can affect staff members’ health and well-being over time. That’s why it’s your responsibility to support the cleaning staff’s long-term health and sustainability. This involves providing ergonomic equipment and tools to cleaning staff, enforcing proper safety protocols, and monitoring the work environment for potential hazards or risks. Strategies for Employee Motivation With motivation and engagement, it will be easier to maintain high levels of productivity and quality. Some strategies managers can use to motivate staff include: Providing regular recognition and praise for a job well done. Offering opportunities for career advancement or skill development. Creating a supportive work environment. Supporting Work-Life Balance As for any other line of work, work-life balance is crucial for cleaning staff. The demanding nature of cleaning work requires offering flexible scheduling options, such as part-time or split shifts, to accommodate family or personal obligations. Also, encourage cleaning staff to take regular breaks and prioritize self-care, such as getting enough rest, staying hydrated, and maintaining a healthy diet. Legal and Ethical Considerations Ensuring that all labour practices related to cleaning staff are fair, legal, and ethical is critical for an employer. This may involve conducting thorough investigations, providing mediation or conflict resolution services, and taking corrective action when necessary to prevent future issues. Upholding Fair Labor Practices From abiding by the laws regarding proper compensation for all hours worked, including overtime pay when applicable, to ensuring that cleaning staff receive legally mandated benefits such as sick leave and vacation time, it is mandatory to follow the Middle East employment laws. Managers should also be vigilant in preventing discrimination, harassment, or exploitation in the workplace. Handling Employee Complaints Despite best efforts, employee complaints or grievances may arise from time to time in your cleaning business. It is essential to have a transparent, fair process in place for handling these complaints. Ensure that all employee complaints are addressed promptly and appropriately.

Conclusion Understanding Workforce Management Challenges in Construction Every construction business faces various workforce management challenges that impact their timelines and budgets. The most common challenges hindering workforce productivity are managing remote locations and changing job sites. Most construction businesses operate at multiple sites spread across different locations. Coordinating and tracking the movement of workers and equipment across multiple sites becomes increasingly complex. Another challenge arises from the need for more skilled labor. Like every other industry, skilled labor plays a crucial role in construction. When there is a labor shortage, the existing workforce has to pick up the slack, which leads to high turnover rates, which can disrupt project timelines and increase costs. Scheduling conflicts are common in construction, particularly when businesses need to use a scheduling software tool. With multiple tasks, subcontractors, and sites, things can get out of schedule quickly if not micromanaged. Safety concerns are another major challenge in construction workforce management. Every construction site has a high risk of accidents and injuries. A common challenge for companies is prioritizing safety and ensuring all workers are trained and equipped to work safely. Unpredictable project timelines can also make construction workforce management difficult. In the construction industry, projects are often susceptible to ripple effects. A problem with one schedule can cause propagating delays throughout the project timeline. Effective Strategies for Streamlining Construction Workforce Management The common construction workforce management challenges we discussed can be overcome with little planning and effective strategies. Here are the tested strategies to streamline construction workforce management- Implementing a Centralized Workforce Management System You cannot expect to streamline the process if your workforce management activities and data are spread across locations and devices. You need a centralized workforce management system that can track and manage all aspects of the workforce in a single platform. It facilitates tracking and management of all aspects of the workforce, such as employee data, scheduling, time and attendance, and more. Utilizing Face Scanning Time and Attendance Tracking Time theft and instances of buddy punching leave businesses in the construction industry with heavy losses every year. One important aspect of workforce planning in construction is accurately tracking worker hours and attendance across job sites. With face scanning time and attendance tracking, business owners can ensure that the right person is on the job site at the required time. For instance, using Truein’s face recognition attendance software , many construction businesses in the Middle East are proactively reducing the risk of errors and fraud. It also helps them reduce administrative burdens and ensure that workers are paid accurately for their time on the job. Providing Mobile Access to Workforce Management Tools Leveraging technology has become vital for every industry, not just construction. With remote work sites and a distributed workforce, construction businesses can significantly benefit from providing their staff mobile access to workforce management tools These tools improve communication and collaboration among workers and managers. Workforce management tools like Truein allow workers to view schedules, request time off, and communicate with managers from anywhere, at any time. This can help reduce delays and improve efficiency on job sites. Leveraging Data and Analytics Leveraging data and analytics can help construction companies make more informed decisions about workforce planning and allocation. Data analytics provide insight into critical workforce management aspects such as worker productivity, attendance, and other metrics. It helps management identify areas for improvement and optimize their workforce management processes. Leveraging data and analytics for construction workforce management can help employers identify skills gaps and easily forecast labor needs. Optimizing Scheduling and Resource Allocation Construction projects have high resource requirements and need regular schedule optimization. Businesses can manage both these factors by using construction workforce/labor management software to optimize scheduling and resource allocation. Scheduling software can help companies ensure that the right workers are assigned to the right tasks at the right time. When schedule and resource allocation are optimized, companies can reduce delays, improve productivity, and ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. Ensuring Safety and Compliance Streamlining construction workforce management is not only about tools, resources, and software. It also includes ensuring safety and compliance. Construction sites are some of the most hazardous workplaces, requiring several safety measures. Companies can manage safety and compliance by providing workers with the necessary training, equipment, and support to work safely on construction sites. To complete projects on time and efficiently, companies must prioritize safety and compliance by reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. Implementing Clear Communication Channels Clear communication is how companies can ensure that everyone engaged in a construction project is working towards the same goals. Such communication can only be facilitated by setting up robust communication channels. This can include regular meetings, progress reports, and other forms of communication that keep everyone informed and engaged. Investing in Training and Development Companies can ease the process of construction workforce management by building a more skilled and productive workforce through training and development. By providing workers with ongoing training and development opportunities, construction companies can improve worker retention, reduce turnover, and ensure workers have the skills and knowledge they need to work safely and efficiently on construction sites. Utilizing Technology and Automation for Shift Management Several aspects of workforce management in the construction industry can be streamlined through automation. Shift management is one such segment that can benefit from automation technology. Think about it: how much time do you spend handling scheduling, communicating with workers, and assigning tasks without technology-backed tools? Construction companies can use automation tools like Truein for shift management to ensure that the right workers are assigned to the right tasks at the right time. It can significantly reduce administrative burdens and improve efficiency on job sites. Measuring and Reviewing Workforce Management Effectiveness The last workforce management strategy in the construction industry is measuring and reviewing workforce management effectiveness. Companies must evaluate the outcome of the implemented strategies to verify what needs to be done for ongoing improvement and optimization. By regularly assessing workforce management processes and strategies they use, companies can identify areas for improvement. It also helps make data-driven decisions about workforce planning and allocation. Significance of Streamlining Workforce Management in Construction Streamlining workforce management in the construction industry is essential due to the inherent complexities of projects. From unpredictable timelines to mandatory coordination among multiple teams and remote sites, construction companies have a lot of challenges to overcome. This signifies the importance of streamlining workforce management for the success of construction projects. By implementing effective workforce management strategies and utilizing tools for workforce management, construction companies can overcome these common challenges and achieve better project outcomes. Effective workforce management can help construction companies reduce costs, improve productivity, and ensure timely completion of projects. For instance, KAD Construction and Al Magamsi General Contracting utilized Truein to eliminate traceability and buddy punching challenges their projects faced. It helped the company improve productivity and ensure attendance across 22 sites for over 6,000 staff. Streamlining workforce management can help construction companies build a more skilled and engaged workforce, reduce turnover, and improve worker safety and well-being. Critical Tools for Streamlining Workforce Management Construction site workforce management will require tools for streamlining processes and automating strategies. Leveraging technology for this process is dependent on choosing the right tools. Three essential tools can help construction companies improve workforce management: Workforce Management Software A workforce management software is a tool that offers a centralized platform for managing all aspects of the workforce, including employee data, scheduling, time and attendance, tasks, projects, and more. Companies can choose from various workforce management software tools to streamline their workforce management processes. However, the software must accompany a mobile app. Construction job sites are scattered, and workers can only be expected to use in-house tools at some sites. A mobile app is essential to any workforce management software, allowing workers and managers to access the platform anytime. Project Management Platforms Project management is an integral part of construction workforce management. That’s why companies need project management platforms to streamline construction workforce management. These platforms act as a centralized hub for managing all aspects of a construction project, including scheduling, budgeting, and communication. Project management platforms help companies improve team collaboration and ensure that construction projects are completed on time and within budget. Equipment Management Tool One of the major causes of losses for construction businesses is equipment theft. In some markets, the loss is as high as $1 billion , which calls for strict measures. Construction companies can prevent such losses using equipment management tools. As part of streamlining construction workforce management, these tools help companies track and manage the use of equipment on job sites. Apart from preventing theft, equipment management tools ensure the right equipment is available when and where needed. It helps reduce downtime, improve productivity, and ensure that projects are completed efficiently. Best Practices for Job Scheduling in Construction Nothing affects workforce management in the construction industry as significantly as job scheduling. It involves project timelines, workers’ availability, costs, and workforce management strategy. Here are some best practices for job scheduling in construction: Detailed Job Planning Detailed job planning is simply effective job scheduling in construction. This involves breaking down projects into tasks, each task into smaller, more manageable steps, and identifying the resources needed to complete each step. Use of Scheduling Software Scheduling software, as mentioned before, helps construction companies streamline job scheduling and improve efficiency on job sites. It automates the scheduling process, ensuring that the right workers are assigned to the right tasks at the right time and prevents potential scheduling conflicts. Develop a Realistic Schedule Companies cannot expect productivity by creating schedules that overwork employees. Developing a realistic schedule is essential for effective job scheduling in construction. A realistic schedule considers weather, equipment availability, and worker skills and availability. Monitor, Adjust, and Manage Resources This step of effective job scheduling involves regularly reviewing the schedule and making adjustments based on weather, equipment availability, and worker productivity. By monitoring and adjusting resources, construction companies can ensure that projects are completed efficiently and effectively. Risk Management Risk management is also essential for effective job scheduling in the construction industry. This step involves identifying potential risks that can impact the job schedule and developing strategies to mitigate those risks. By managing risks effectively, companies can reduce the impact of delays and other issues on project timelines and budgets. Documentation and Reporting Keeping accurate records of job progress, worker hours, and other key metrics is essential for workforce management. By documenting and reporting on job progress, construction companies can identify areas for improvement. It also facilitates data-driven decision-making regarding workforce planning and allocation. Continuous Improvement Continuous improvement in job scheduling is the only effective way to optimize schedules and achieve better project outcomes. Such improvement demands regularly reviewing job scheduling processes and making improvements based on data and feedback from workers and managers. Compliance and Safety Companies must ensure that all workers are adequately trained and equipped to work safely on construction sites. Also, workers should be made aware of the safety regulations and standards that are followed. Managers and supervisors must prioritize compliance and safety to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries. Future Trends in Construction Workforce Management Like every other aspect of the construction industry, several emerging technologies significantly impact construction workforce management. These technologies include: Artificial Intelligence (AI) AI technology is making inroads into construction workforce planning and allocation. From analyzing data on worker productivity, attendance, etc., to identifying potential safety hazards, AI is assisting in developing strategies to improve workforce management significantly. Machine Learning Machine learning is another futuristic technology that helps construction companies improve their workforce management processes. ML models can help large construction companies analyze data to identify patterns and trends. For example, machine learning can help companies predict labor needs and optimize schedules based on historical data. Automation Automation of routine tasks, such as time and attendance tracking, scheduling, and reporting, can benefit construction companies significantly. Tools such as Truein are becoming increasingly indispensable for automating these tasks and helping companies streamline administrative processes and improve efficiency. The potential impact of these emerging technologies can be felt across several areas of the construction industry. For instance, AI and ML in site selection and planning can help companies quickly assess soil conditions and transportation accessibility and identify optimal locations for construction projects. These technologies will become significant for optimizing workforce management processes, reducing costs, and improving project outcomes.

Q: Are there penalties for non-compliance with Qatar’s labour laws? Q: Are there any provisions in the new labour laws addressing workplace discrimination and harassment? Q: How do Qatar’s labour laws address issues related to maternity leave and employee parental rights? Understanding Qatar Labour Law The Qatar Labour Law is a comprehensive framework designed to regulate the relationship between employers and employees within the country, which lays the foundation for the legal rights, responsibilities, and constraints that workers, employers, and workers’ committees have. Employers and employees are required to follow the Qatar Labour Law, and both parties should be aware of their rights and obligations. The Qatar Labour Law is governed by Law No. 14 of 2004 , which sets out the rules and regulations for employment in Qatar. The law covers various aspects of employment, including working conditions, wages, leaves, termination of employment, and employee benefits. Now, we will look at the most essential elements of the Qatar Labour Law. Employment Contracts in Qatar Employment contracts in Qatar are legally binding agreements between employers and employees that outline the terms and conditions of employment. All employers must provide their employees with employment contracts or an official letter of employment detailing the terms of work. While employers can draft employment contracts in English, the Qatar Ministry of Labour only recognizes the official version of the Arabic contract. These contracts are crucial as they clarify and prevent disputes by clearly defining both parties’ roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Types of Employment Contracts in Qatar In Qatar, there are primarily three types of employment contracts allowed: Fixed Term Contracts These contracts are for a specific duration, generally up to 5 years. It can include the probation period, after which the termination is based upon mutual agreement. The employer must pay compensation and benefits if the employee disagrees with the termination. Indefinite Term Contracts Employment under indefinite contracts allows employers to hire employees for an indefinite period. These contracts do not have a specified end date and continue until either party terminates the agreement. Any party can terminate the employment without giving any reason. However, if the employee has been working for the employer for less than five years, they must provide a one-month notice, and if they have been working for more than five years, a two-month notice must be given before leaving the job. Job completion Casual work contracts or job completion contracts are the temporary contracts that should not exceed 4 weeks but they can be extended for the same time if both parties agree. This contract is unlike indefinite term contract that does not have any expiration date and can be terminated only by the contracted parties. An Employment Contract Must Include Name of the employer and place of employment Name of employee, qualifications, address, nationality, place of residence and identity proof Contract type Date and place of signing the contract Job description Probation period Starting date of the contract Leave entitlement and benefits Duration in case of a fixed term contract Payment method, salary, payment intervals Key Provisions of the Act Under Qatar labour laws, employees are provided benefits and protection from working conditions that employers must know. For instance, employees can work up to six days a week or more than 10 hours daily. Here are the key provisions of the act: Restrictive Covenants Restrictive covenants are clauses that can be included in employment contracts that restrict an employee’s actions after the term of employment. These clauses prevent ex-employees from competing with their employers for a specified period. Employers can also use restrictive covenants to prohibit employees from using any information about clients or deals gained during employment. While restrictive covenants are similar to a non-compete contract, they can last up to two years. Under the current labour law in Qatar, non-compete agreements cannot last more than one year. Notice Period The notice period is the time frame an employee or employer must provide before terminating an employment contract. Previously, the standard notice period was one month for employees who have worked for the employer for up to 5 years and two months for those who have worked for more than five years. Under the new labour laws, employees working for less than two years must serve one month’s notice, while those working for the same employer for more than two years must serve two months’ notice. Sick Leaves Under the updated Qatar Labour Law, employees are entitled to sick leave if they work for more than three weeks for their employer and can provide a medical certificate by an authorized physician. Employees can take up to 14 days of paid sick leave annually. If the sickness extends beyond 14 days, employers are not entitled to pay for sick leaves. Employee Protection in Qatar Qatar labour rules also provide employee protections under the amended laws. Here are the significant protections offered: Working Hours and Weekends The standard working hours in Qatar are 48 hours per week, with a maximum of ten hours per day. Employees are entitled to one day off per week, usually on Fridays. However, during the holy month of Ramadan, working hours are reduced to six hours per day or 36 hours per week. Employees are entitled to overtime pay for working more than 10 hours daily. The overtime pay rate must be at least 25% more than the regular wage rate for day hours and 50% higher for night hours. Minimum Wage The Ministry of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs (MADLSA) regulates the minimum wage in Qatar. As of 2024, the new minimum wage is QAR 1,000 per month, along with QAR 500 housing allowance and QAD 300 for food. Additional allowances must be provided to foreign workers if the employer does not offer these. Working Hours and Overtime As mentioned, the standard working hours are 48 hours per week. Employers must ensure that working hours are 10 hours a day without overtime pay. Regulations for Overtime Work Employees are entitled to additional compensation for overtime work, calculated at 125% of their regular hourly wage. Employers should provide a day off and compensation at 150% of the regular hourly wage for working on holidays. Rest Periods and Breaks Employees are entitled to rest periods during their working hours. After every five consecutive hours of work, a break of at least one hour must be provided. This break is not included in the calculation of total working hours. Additionally, employees should have a weekly rest day, usually Friday, unless otherwise agreed. Main Rights and Obligations of Workers in Qatar The 2024 updates to the Qatar Labour Law underscore the country’s dedication to ensuring the rights and well-being of its workforce. This section highlights the legal protections and the specific rights afforded to workers. Anti-discrimination Laws There exists no specific law in Qatar addressing discrimination at work. There is mention in the legislation that there should be no discrimination or unfair treatment based on race, gender, religion, nationality, or disability. However, the QFC Employment Regulations 2019 provide more precise protection against workplace discrimination. However, positive discrimination in favour of Qatari nationals is permitted. Health and Safety Regulations Qatar places a high emphasis on health and safety in the workplace. Employers must provide a safe working environment, conduct regular safety training, and ensure all safety equipment is available and in good condition. All employers must offer health insurance coverage, including medical care, hospitalization, and medication. Rights of Foreign Workers Foreign workers make up a significant portion of the workforce in Qatar. The updated labor laws provide better protection for expatriate workers, ensuring they receive the same rights and benefits as Qatari nationals. This includes the right to change jobs without requiring a no-objection certificate from their current employer, a significant step towards improving labor mobility and reducing dependency on employers. Annual Leave and Holidays Employees in Qatar are entitled to paid annual leave, with the duration depending on their length of service. After one year of continuous service, employees are entitled to three weeks of paid annual leave. If they work more than five years for the same employer, they can take up to 4 weeks of paid leave annually. Additionally, there are eight public holidays for which employees are entitled to 3 leaves for Eid El-Fitr, three for Eid Al-Adha, one for Independence Day, and one for National Sports Day. Social Security and Health Insurance The 2024 amendments to the Qatar Labour Law introduce mandatory health insurance for all employees. Employers must register their workers with the General Retirement and Social Insurance Authority (GRSIA) and contribute to their social security. Additionally, they must provide health insurance coverage, ensuring access to medical care for all workers. Termination of Employment Termination of employment is a critical aspect of Qatar labour law. Understanding regulations regarding ending the working relationship between an employer and an employee is essential. Termination of Definite Term Contracts Definite-term contracts can be terminated upon the expiry of the contract term or by mutual agreement between the employer and employee. If either party wishes to terminate the contract before its expiry, they must provide a valid reason and adhere to the notice period requirements. An employer must offer additional benefits and compensation if the employee disagrees with termination. Termination of Indefinite Term Contracts Either party can terminate indefinite-term contracts without giving any reason. Employees must serve a one-month notice period if they work for the employer for less than five years. Otherwise, they must serve a two-month notice period. Disciplinary Termination Employers have the right to terminate an employee for disciplinary reasons, such as misconduct or violation of company policies. The disciplinary termination must follow a fair and transparent process, allowing the employees to defend themselves before deciding. Termination Due to Force Majeure Termination due to force majeure, such as natural disasters or other extraordinary events, is permissible under the Qatar Labour Law. The event must be “beyond the control of the parties, have been unforeseeable at the time the agreement was entered into” for force majeure. As Qatari law doesn’t stipulate what constitutes force majeure, employers must specify in the contracts which events will be considered force majeure for termination. End of Service Benefits and Entitlements Employees in Qatar are entitled to end-of-service benefits upon the termination of their employment. The Qatar labour law for gratuity requires employers to pay three weeks’ wages each year as gratuity if the employee has worked for less than five years. For more than five years, the employee must receive a gratuity of one month’s wage for each year worked. Additional entitlements include: Payment of all outstanding benefits and wages Compensation for wrongful dismissal, if proven Issuance of experience certificate Payment of accrued but unused paid leaves Provision of a return ticket if the employee is a foreigner and not able to obtain a new work visa within 90 days of the termination date How can Truein help businesses?

The country is, however, diversifying its economy to move away from its reliance on oil reserves. In doing so, Oman is introducing amendments to its long-standing employment law to attract workforce from other countries. The Oman Labour Law (Royal Decree No. 35/2003) and its subsequent amendments govern Oman’s employment law. This guide explores the legal framework for employer-employee relationships in the Sultanate. We will also establish how the new labour law in Oman affects various aspects, including employment contracts, working hours, leave entitlements, termination procedures, and the rights and obligations of both employers and employees. Understanding Oman Labour Law is crucial for employers to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Given the diverse workforce available in Oman, fostering a positive employment environment and avoiding potential legal disputes will require knowledge of updates in 2024 for maintaining lawful and effective business operations.

Conclusion FAQs Q: What are the standard working hours in Oman? Q: What are the rules regarding overtime pay in Oman? Q: What are the provisions for maternity leave in Oman? Q: What should the employment contract include? Q: What are the regulations regarding discrimination in the workplace? Labour Laws in Oman Oman employment law sets out the general principles and regulations governing employment in the country. Every employer, irrespective of the state of their business license, must adhere to these labour laws. They cover various issues, including recruitment, employment contracts, working conditions, and termination. The key provisions of the new labour law in Oman include regulating working hours, wage payment, and employee benefits. The law aims to protect workers’ rights. It includes significant amendments to reduce work hours, paternal leave, leave carry-over, bereavement leave for non-Omani women, and collective labour agreements. The Labour Law stated new provisions which regulate the process for termination, aimed at making sure that there is an equitable process for employee and employer both. Also, the New Labour Law has increased the duration of some categories for leaves and even added new categories. Annual leave- 30 days per year Sick leave- 182 days per year Paternity leave- 7 days Maternity leave- 98 days Marriage- 3 days Death of family member- depending on the relation Hajj leave- 10-15 days Examination leave- 15 days Unpaid leave for childcare for women- 1 year Omanization Policy The Omanization policy is a national initiative aimed at increasing the employment of Omani nationals in the private sector. Under this policy, which took effect on April 1, 2024, all Omani companies owned by foreign investors must employ at least one Omani citizen within one year of their formation. Additionally, if companies fail to comply with the policy within a year, they will be provided a 30-day grace period, beyond which they will be subjected to fines. This policy is designed to reduce reliance on expatriate labour and promote the development of local talent. Strategies for Localising Workforce – The employer must share with the Ministry of Labour the annual strategies for localising the workforce. The data which includes specifics like count of Omani workers, gender diversity, job positions, and wage must be accessible within the workplace. Training and Leadership – The New Law states that every company must create a plan for choosing and training the Omani employees for the leadership positions and ensure that the plan is well implemented. Omanisation Promotion – The New Law also permits termination of non Omani employees when the termination reason is to replace them with some Omani national. Employment of Expatriates Oman has a high number of foreign workers. Currently, expatriates make up 42.26% of the total population , so employers must know the labour law in Oman for expatriates. Visa and Work Permits Before expats can be hired, employers must ensure they have the necessary visas and work permits from the Sultanate before they can commence employment. The visa and work permits have a thorough application process, including medical examinations and security clearances. Labour Laws for Expatriates Of all the emirates in the Middle East, Oman has the most straightforward labour laws for expats, as they are subject to the same labour laws as Omani nationals. However, additional regulations concerning their recruitment, employment contracts, and termination include visas, work permits, and medical history. The Labour Law 53/2023 ensures safety of expats through various articles. The employees are entitled to annual leaves with comprehensive pay of not less than 30 days, which he or she can take as per their requirements and they may not take leave before expiry of 6 months from date of joining with the employer.  Further, the employer may pay basic wage for days of annual leave that the worker did not take if he/she agrees in writing. The expats are also covered by Oman labour law for salary increments. It is good to see that the law appreciates the contribution of expat workers and ensures fair treatment. Expatriate Taxation Oman does not impose personal income tax on expatriates. Additionally, expats are exempted from social insurance contributions. However, they must pay Job Security Fund contributions. Recruiting Expatriate Talent Employers must ensure that the recruitment of expatriates aligns with the Omanization policy and obtain necessary clearances from the Ministry of Labour. The expat must have professional competence or technical skills or qualifications required by the Sultanate. Also, the employer has the permit to hire the expatriate and the latter must have entered the country in a legal manner. Expat must also satisfy the conditions set out in Foreign Residence Law i.e. valid passport, sponsorship, valid visa etc. Further, the expat employee is required to be medically free and fit of all chronic and contagious diseases mentioned by the Ministry of Health. Onboarding Expatriates Effective onboarding includes cultural orientation, ensuring legal compliance, and providing necessary training to integrate expatriates into the workforce smoothly. Cultural Integration Cultural integration programs help expatriates adapt to the local culture and workplace environment, fostering a harmonious working relationship. Employment Contracts for Expatriates The same rules of employment contracts apply to expatriates as for Omanis. They can have finite and infinite employment contracts that clearly outline the terms of employment, including job duties, salary, benefits, and termination conditions, and must comply with Omani labour laws. Social Insurance Law Effective January 1, 2024, the Omani government introduced a new social insurance law through royal decree No. 52/2023. As per the new law, employers must contribute towards insurance for: Old Age, Disability, and Death- The employee share is 7.5% and the employer share is 11% Work Injuries and Occupational Disease- there is only the employer share of 1% with maximum salary (OMR) of 3000 Employment Security- the employee and the employer have 0.5% both, making it a total of 1% Maternity Leaves (effective July 2024)- here the employer share is 1% Sick and Other Leaves (effective July 2025)- here too there is the employer share of 1% All these monthly contributions are calculated based on the number of working days in each month. Laws on Labour Unions Labour unions in Oman are permitted if the employer policies allow them. Employers and employees can participate in collective bargaining, dispute resolution, and worker rights advocacy. However, the law provides a framework for establishing and operating labour unions to protect and promote employees’ interests. Working Hours Previously, the standard working hours in Oman were 8.5 hours a day. Under the new amendments, this time is trimmed to 8 hours a day or 40 hours per week. During Ramadan, Muslim employees are entitled to reduced working hours of six hours per day or 30 hours per week. The Oman Labour Law 2003 says that the minimum employment age is 15 years while the minors from 15-18 years of age are not allowed to work between 6 pm to 6 am. New Rights for Employers The new Oman employment law provides some new rights to employers for improved management of a multicultural workforce. Here are new rights every employer in Oman must know: Recognition of Non-compete Clauses (Article 69) Article 69 recognizes the validity of non-compete clauses in employment contracts where the nature of an employee’s role puts him in a position to compete with the employer. However, the clauses must be reasonable in scope, duration, and geographic area and necessary to protect the employer’s legitimate business interests. Termination due to Redundancy (Article 43(4)) Employers can terminate employees due to redundancy, provided genuine business needs justify it. It can be due to a change of business operations, the closing of an establishment, or the need for a reduced number of staff. Reduction of Staff due to Economic Cause (Article 44) Economic conditions that necessitate a reduction in workforce upon approval by the Ministry of Labour can make ground for the reduction of staff. It is applicable if an employer suffers economic losses for no less than two consecutive years. Termination of Underperforming Staff (Article 43(3)) Employers can terminate employees for underperformance but must first provide a grace period of six months. The employer can terminate employment if the performance is not improved within the grace period. Definite Period Contracts (Article 34) The renewed contracts will remain definite period contracts if they do not exceed five years. Employers must specify the duration and conditions under which they can be renewed or terminated. Employer Obligations and Responsibilities As an employer, there are certain obligations that you are expected to fulfill under the revised Oman employment law: Work Permits and Fair Job Offers Employers ensure all employees have valid work permits and offer fair employment terms that comply with Omani labor laws. Employers must secure the appropriate work permits and visas for expatriate employees before they can legally work in Oman. Expatriate employees must undergo a medical examination to ensure they meet the health requirements set by the Omani authorities. Additional Employers must also provide fair and transparent job offers, ensuring that the offer clearly outlines the job role, responsibilities, and expectations. The offer should specify the salary, allowances, benefits, and other compensatory elements. Health and Safety Employers must provide a safe working environment, conduct regular safety training, and adhere to occupational health and safety regulations. Regular health inspections are conducted to identify and mitigate potential hazards. Non-Discrimination Discrimination based on gender, nationality, religion, or any other prohibited ground is strictly forbidden. Employers must promote equality and inclusivity in the workplace. Also, they must establish procedures to address and prevent harassment and bullying in the workplace. Social Security Employers must contribute to the social insurance schemes as discussed above. Ensuring employees are registered and covered under the social security system is also essential. Payment of Wages Wages must be paid on time and in full per the employment contract. According to Article 51 of the Oman Labour Law, monthly salaried employees must be paid regularly once a month. In case of piecemeal, weekly, or period exceeding two weeks: Payment for the first week of work must be made within one week of completion Payment of the remaining balance within one week of the job’s completion Deductions from Wages Deductions from wages are only permissible if mentioned in the employment contracts outlined by the Labour Law, such as for social insurance contributions or disciplinary fines. No deductions can be made without the consent of the employee. Penalties for Employers' Non-Compliance Non-compliance with labour laws can result in significant penalties, including fines, business license suspension, and legal action. In serious non-compliance, authorities can issue the suspension of services until the issues are resolved and full compliance is established. Confidentiality and Non-Compete Clauses Omani labour laws allow confidentiality and non-compete clauses in the employment contracts. Confidentiality clauses can be included to protect sensitive business information such as trade secrets and client information. Confidentiality Clause a. Clarity of clauses: Clearly define what constitutes confidential information. b. Reasonable Scope: Ensure the scope is reasonable in terms of duration and breadth because confidentiality clauses cannot restrict public knowledge. Non-Compete Clauses Non-compete clauses prevent employees from joining competitors or starting a competing business for a specified period. In Oman, non-compete clauses are more strictly implemented than confidentiality clauses. Employers can include non-compete clauses only if they demonstrate the need for a non-compete clause. Royal Decree on the Protection of Workers' Rights The Royal Decree on the Protection of Workers’ Rights enhances employee protections, including provisions for fair treatment, dispute resolution, and enforcement of labour rights. It underscores the government’s commitment to safeguarding worker welfare. Rest Period & Leave Policies Under the new labour law in Oman, the rest period and leaves are further improved. Here are the benefits offered: Annual Leave: Employees are entitled to at least 30 days of paid annual leave after six months of service. Bereavement Leave: Employees are granted bereavement leave for the death of close family members, typically ranging from 3 to 7 days. Al-Hajj Pilgrimage Leave: All Muslim employees are entitled to special leave for performing the Al-Hajj pilgrimage for up to 15 days once in their employment period. Study Leave: 15 days for Omani employees to pursue further education. Public Holidays: It depends on the annual holiday calendar issued by the authorities. However, employees are entitled to paid leave on public holidays recognized in Oman, which include Islamic and national holidays. Sick Leave: The new labour law in Oman entitles employees to up to 182 days per year of sick leave with the following payment structure: Day 1 to Day 21 on full payment Day 22 to Day 35 on 75 percent payment Day 36 to Day 70 on 50 percent payment Day 71 to Day 182 on 35 percent payment Special Leave: Special leave provisions exist for events such as marriage, childbirth, and emergencies, as specified in the employment contract or company policy. Marriage Leave: Employees may be granted three days’ leave for their marriage. This is the 3 day paid marriage leave with a gross salary. This leave is granted only once through the entire service period. Employment Contracts & Agreements In Oman’s labour market, several types of employment contracts are allowed.

Q: What types of leaves are employees entitled to under Saudi labour laws? Q: How is overtime pay calculated in Saudi Arabia? Understanding Saudi Arabia's Employment Laws Saudi Arabia’s employment law provides a legal framework to regulate the relationship between employers and employees, ensuring that both parties know their rights and obligations. While employees must be familiar with rights, employers must also know their obligations and rights. The provisions in the Saudi labour law include employment contracts, working hours, wages, leave entitlements, and termination of employment. What are Saudi Arabia Employment Laws? The Saudi Arabia Employment Laws are primarily governed by the Saudi Labour Law issued by Royal Decree No. M/51 of 23 Sha’ban 1426 (September 27, 2005) . It sets the legal framework for employment in the Kingdom. However, the Kingdom made some significant amendments to the existing labour laws under Resolution No. 51848/1442 that took effect in March 2021. These updates address new challenges and improve worker protections. Let’s delve deeper into Saudi Arabia labour laws employers must know in 2024. Recent Labour Law Reform The amendments brought in by Resolution No. 51848/1442 make it a lot easier for employees to look for, change, and leave their jobs. Before these reforms, foreign workers had to seek permission from their employers to change jobs or perform any other administrative tasks. The essential changes outlined in the resolution are: Employees can leave their jobs without their employer’s consent when their contract ends. Employees can leave their jobs during the contract period if they have been in the country for a year and serve 90 days’ notice. Now, employees can change their employment within the first year under certain conditions. Use the electronic portal to look for jobs, notify employers, and input transfer requests. These reforms are part of a broader effort to modernize the labour market, reduce unemployment, and ensure fair treatment of all workers in Saudi Arabia. As for the employers, the latest labour law reform states: Employers can terminate employees on indefinite contracts if they have cause like employee misconduct The notice period is 60 days for employees that get a monthly salary and 30 days otherwise. Still the work contract may stipulate longer notice period and the employer can offer pay in lieu of the notice. Also, employers can even terminate fixed term contracts with a just cause. But the assumption is that the employers will not renew the fixed term contract after the end date. As per KSA labour law, both the parties should agree on notice period in their contract. If the contract doesn’t say any notice period, then it is 60 days. Saudi Arabia Laws Regarding Employment The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has strict employment laws that apply to all employees regardless of nationality. Saudi Arabia has a minimum age requirement. Male employees must be 21 or older to be legally employed. For females, the minimum age requirement for employment is 22 years. Any person under 18 and 15 or older is recognized as a minor. Minors cannot be employed in any hazardous work or a role that may endanger their health, safety, or morals. Any person below the age of 15 cannot be employed or allowed to enter a place of work. All employees should undergo a medical examination from an accredited authority to prove their fitness for the position. All female workers must adhere to specific dress codes in the workplace. This means that as a woman, you must wear a long sleeved top or dress, high neckline and should be loose fitted. On the bottom, one must wear full length and loose skirts or bottoms. These regulations are designed to create a safe and equitable work environment for all employees, regardless of age or gender. Labour Regulations for Saudi Nationals/ Saudisation To support the nationals and economy, Saudi Arabia has introduced the policy of Saudi Nationalisation, popularly known as the Saudisation policy or Nitaqat, in local terms. The Saudisation regulation requires businesses operating in Saudi Arabia to fulfill a quota for hiring Saudi Arabians. Note that Saudisation requirements depend on three factors: Classification of a business Size of the business Percentage of current Sau di employees in the workforce The 2024 updates to the Saudi Labour Law reinforced this policy with several key measures: Companies with five or fewer employees must have at least 1 Saudi employee. For international companies, a Saudi national must hold the role next to the General Manager. Businesses with more than 100 employees must have 30% Saudisation. Companies must meet specific Saudisation quotas based on which they are given Premium, Green, and Red status. Premium and Green-status companies can apply for block visas, while red-status businesses can only obtain visas for expatriate employees through a transfer of sponsorship. This means that Red status businesses can only hire foreign workers if they are already in the country and have requisite work authorizations from their current employers. Distinct Labour Regulations for Expatriate Employees Expatriate employees form a significant portion of the workforce in Saudi Arabia. 66% of the total workforce in Saudi Arabia is made of expatriates. Therefore, there are distinct labour regulations to regulate foreign worker employment and ensure their rights are protected. Regulations for Expatriate Employees The 2024 updates to the Saudi Labour Law introduce several significant changes for expatriate workers: Employers must have the approval of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development to hire expatriates. Expatriate employees must have valid work permits and residency visas (Iqama). Employers are responsible for obtaining and renewing these permits. New labour law in Saudi Arabia requires non-Saudi workers to have a written work contract with a fixed term. An employer cannot employ non-Saudis for a role other than specified in their work permit. Foreigners cannot change their profession without taking the necessary legal measures. Employers must follow stipulated rules and procedures before allowing foreign workers to work for others. Iqama Visa The Iqama visa is a residency permit that allows expatriates to live and work in Saudi Arabia for the long term. It is an essential document for expatriate employees and must be obtained and renewed regularly. To obtain an Iqama visa, expatriates must comply with all these regulations: Have sponsorship from an employer. Sponsorship must be from a Saudi company or a business licensed to conduct business in Saudi Arabia. Take medical examinations for a residential permit Foreign workers must apply for Iqama within 90 days of arrival in Saudi Arabia. What are the Time Management Laws in Saudi Arabia? Time management laws in Saudi Arabia regulate working hours, rest periods, and overtime to ensure a fair balance between work and personal life. Key provisions include Standard Working Hours: The standard working hours are eight hours per day and 48 hours per week. However, during Ramadan, the working hours are reduced to six hours per day or 36 hours per week. Rest Periods: Employees are entitled to a break of at least 30 minutes for rest, prayer, or meals after five consecutive work hours. Overtime: Employees who work beyond the standard hours are entitled to overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular hourly wage. Alternatively, employers and employees can also agree to compensatory time off instead of overtime pay. Weekly Rest: Friday is the official weekly off for employees in Saudi Arabia. Businesses can change the weekly off day, but all workers are entitled to at least one full day of rest per week. Public Holidays: Employers must provide paid leave for officially recognized public holidays in Saudi Arabia. There are 5 public holidays in Saudi Arabia- Saudi Founding Day, Eid-al-Fitr, Arafat Day, Eid-al-Adha and Saudi National Day. These regulations ensure that employees have adequate rest and are compensated fairly for extra work. Additional Rights and Obligations of Employers in Saudi Arabia Employers must know several additional rights and obligations under the labour law, such as anti-discrimination laws, health and safety regulations, leave entitlements, and social security provisions. Anti-discrimination Laws The new amendments to the Saudi Labour Law include specific anti-discrimination provisions to protect employees from unfair treatment based on race, gender, nationality, religion, or disability. Employers must ensure a workplace free from discrimination and promote equality and diversity. Health and Safety Regulations The health and safety regulations require employers to provide regular safety training sessions for employees to ensure they are aware of potential hazards and how to avoid them. All necessary safety equipment must be installed and must be in good condition. Also, there must be clear emergency procedures, including fire drills and evacuation plans. Annual Leave and Holidays Employees in Saudi Arabia are entitled to annual leave and public holidays, including: 21 days of paid annual leave after 1-5 years of service, which increases to 30 days after five years of service. Employees are entitled to public holidays, usually 10-12 days, including Eid Al-Fitr, Eid Al-Adha, and National Day. Social Security and Health Insurance Employers must provide social security and health insurance benefits to their employees. The General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) provides social security benefits, including pensions and disability benefits. Employers must register their employees by the GOSI. Additionally, employers must provide health insurance coverage for their employees, ensuring access to medical care. Leave Entitlements Employees in Saudi Arabia are entitled to various types of leave, including: Sick Leave: Employees are entitled to up to 30 days of paid sick leave annually, with a medical certificate. The next 60 days may go from one third to three quarter. Maternity Leave: All female employees are entitled to 10 weeks of paid maternity leave. Paternity Leave: Fathers are entitled to three days of paid paternity leave. Bereavement Leave: Employees are entitled to five days of leave in case of the death of a spouse, relative, or close family member. Hajj Leave: Muslim employees who have completed two years of service are entitled to 10 days to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. This is 10-15 days of paid religious leave. Working Hours and Overtime The Saudi Labour Law mandates employers to fix regular work hours to 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week, reduced to six hours per day during Ramadan. Any additional hours must be considered overtime and compensated at 150% of the regular hourly wage. Public Holidays Employees are entitled to public holidays, including Eid Al-Fitr, four days; Eid Al-Adha, four days; and National Day, one day. Payroll Rules in Saudi Arabia Compensation regulations are essential for compliance in Saudi Arabia. Key provisions are designed to ensure employees are paid fairly and on time. Minimum Wage & Payment of Wages There is no universal minimum wage mandate in the private sector in Saudi Arabia. However, the public sector has a monthly minimum salary requirement of SAR 3,000. Employers must pay wages at least once a month and ensure that payments are made on time. Wages must be paid in Saudi Riyals unless otherwise agreed. Deductions from Wages Employers are allowed to make deductions from an employee’s wages. Deductions for taxes and social security contributions are allowed. Deductions for fines imposed for violations of company policies, provided they are documented and communicated to the employee. Any deduction without the employees’ consent or those reducing the wages below the minimum threshold is prohibited. What is an Employment Contract under the Saudi Arabia Labour Law? An employment contract in Saudi Arabia is a legally binding agreement between an employer and an employee that outlines the terms and conditions of employment. The employment contract is necessary and must comply with the provisions of Saudi Labour Law and clearly define both parties’ rights and obligations. Types of Employment Contracts in Saudi Arabia In Saudi Arabia, two broad types of employment contracts are allowed to ensure compliance with labour laws. Definite Term Contracts: These contracts are for a specified duration and automatically terminate upon the expiry of the contract term. They are commonly used for temporary or project-based employment. Indefinite Term Contracts: These are open contracts without any specified end date and continue until either party terminates the agreement. Saudi Labour Law Requirements for Employment Contracts For a valid employment contract, the following specifications must be included in the contract: Compensation and Benefits Employment contracts must clearly outline the compensation and benefits the employee is entitled to, including salary, allowances, bonuses, and other financial benefits. Probation Period The employment contract must specify the probation period and cannot exceed 90 days. During this period, either party can terminate the contract without notice. Additionally, the probation terms must be included in the contract. Termination Conditions An employment contract must have specified conditions under which it can be terminated, including notice periods and grounds for termination. Employee Rights Employee’s rights, such as leave entitlements, working hours, and other statutory benefits, must be included in the contract. Working Hours and Days Off The contract must specify the working hours and days off in compliance with the labour law’s requirements. Written Contract Saudi Arabia labour law requires that all employment contracts be in writing and signed by both parties. Verbal agreements are not legally binding. Duration and Renewal The duration and conditions for renewal must be clearly specified for definite-term contracts. Guidelines for Creating an Employment Contract under Saudi Labour Laws Two articles outline the essentials of an employment contract under the new labour law in Saudi Arabia. These are: Article 51 Article 51 of the Saudi Labour Law stipulates that employment contracts must include specific information, such as the employee’s name, job title, salary, and work location. It also requires that contracts be in Arabic and signed by both parties. Article 52 Article 52 further specifies the elements that must be included in an employment contract, such as the date of commencement, probation period, and conditions for termination. It ensures that both parties clearly understand their obligations and rights. Termination of Service in Saudi Arabia The termination process in Saudi Arabia depends on the employment setup, the type of employment contract, and the reason for termination. But the general workflow of termination of services is as follows: Termination Procedures and Notice Periods Termination procedures in Saudi Arabia must be lawful. Employers must provide a valid reason for termination and adhere to the required notice periods. Employees with definite term contracts can be terminated upon the expiry of the term or by mutual agreement. Those on indefinite contracts require a notice period of 30 days if terminated by the employer and 15 days if terminated by the employee. Calculation and Payment of End-of-Service Employees are entitled to end-of-service benefits based on their length of service. The benefits are calculated as follows: First Five Years: Half a month’s salary for each year of service. Subsequent Years: One month’s salary for each additional year of service. Resignation and Termination Obligations of Employers Employers must provide employees with a service certificate upon termination, outlining the duration of employment and the nature of the job performed. Employers must also settle all dues, including unpaid wages and end-of-service benefits. Penalties for Improper Termination In case of improper termination, such as without a valid reason or adherence to the notice period, the Ministry can levy legal penalties. Employees may be entitled to compensation for unfair dismissal. Severance Pay Employees are entitled to severance pay under certain conditions, including termination without cause or upon the expiry of a definite term contract. The severance pay is calculated based on the employee’s length of service and final salary. How can Truein Help Businesses?

While the country’s hardworking workforce has over 3.29 million foreigners from over 100 countries, Kuwait’s employment laws form the backbone of the country’s labour market regulations. As of 2024, these laws continue to evolve, reflecting the changing dynamics of the global workforce and Kuwait’s unique socio-economic landscape. Employers must understand Kuwait employment law. Compliance with these regulations is essential to avoid legal complications and maintain a harmonious work environment. In this article, we explore Kuwait’s labour laws in detail. Table of Contents Labour Law in Kuwait Minimum Wages Bonuses Overtime Labour Disputes Break Time Important clauses for employers to know Working Hours and Rest Days Kuwait Taxation Laws Laws towards Minors and Female Employees Payment & deductions from wages Employment Laws Concerning Expatriates Visa and Work Permits Labour Laws for Expatriates Expatriate Taxation Laws on Trade Unions Laws on Discrimination and Harassment Health Insurance in Kuwait Data Protection and Employee Privacy Occupational Health and Safety Penalties for Employers' Non-Compliance Rest Period & Leave Policies in Kuwait Employment Contracts & Agreements Types of Contracts What Should a Contract Include? Termination of Employment Permissible grounds for termination include: Procedures to follow Termination Indemnity How Truein Can Enhance Employee Management with Time Tracking? Conclusion FAQs 1. What are the requirements for drafting an employment contract in Kuwait? 2. What are the regulations regarding employee termination and severance pay in Kuwait? Labour Law in Kuwait Kuwait Labour Laws, included in Law No. 6 of 2010 and its subsequent amendments, is the primary law that deals with employment relationships in the private sector. Here are the critical aspects of this law: Minimum Wages As of 2024, according to the Kuwait employment law, the minimum wage is 75 Kuwaiti Dinars (KWD) per month for private sector employees. This applies to both Kuwaiti nationals and expatriate workers. However, workers seldom earn this low; on average, employees’ monthly wages are much higher. All full-time employees in the private sector are eligible for minimum wages. Bonuses Bonuses are not mandated by law in Kuwait. However, most private-sector employers offer performance bonuses. The bonuses become mandatory under Kuwait’s employment laws when included in employment contracts or company policies. The eligibility for bonuses depends on company policies. Typically, eligibility depends on individual performance and company profitability. Overtime Overtime work in Kuwait is regulated under Article 66 of the Labour Law . Unlike Western countries, the standard workweek is 48-hour or 8-hour workday. Friday is the official weekend. Any hours over 48 hours a week are counted as overtime. Workers must be paid 125% of the regular wage rate for working overtime during the day on regular work days. 150% of the regular wage rate must be paid for overtime at night, holidays, or weekends. Labour Disputes The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour handles all labour disputes in Kuwait. Both employers and employees have the right to file complaints and seek resolution through official channels for labour disputes. Break Time Article 64 of the Labour Law mandates a one-hour break after every five consecutive work hours. This break must be one hour long, including time for prayers, meals, etc. All private and public sector employees are eligible for these breaks, which are considered part of the working hours and must be paid. Important clauses for employers to know Article 46 of the Kuwait Labour Law prohibits employment of minors under 15 years of age. Article 28 of the labour law mandates that employment contracts be in writing and Arabic. Only the Arabic version of the employment contract is valid in a court of law. Working Hours and Rest Days The standard working in Kuwait is 48 hours. This is typically spread over six days, from Saturday to Sunday. Friday is the official weekly rest day. Daily working hours should be at most 8 hours, excluding break times without overtime pay. During Ramadan, the working hours are reduced to 36 hours per week for Muslim employees. For non-Muslim employees, there is no reduction in work hours, and they are required to work regular hours. Additionally, working outside is prohibited from 11 am to 4 pm during the summer period, from June to August. The exception to this rule is oil and gas workers Kuwait Taxation Laws Kuwait is one of the most prosperous countries, and there is no personal income tax on employees, whether Kuwaiti nationals or expatriates. However, employers must contribute to the social security of their Kuwaiti employees. Both the employer and employee must make contributions to the social security. As of 2024, there have been discussions about introducing a value-added tax (VAT) system, but concrete implementation has yet to occur. Laws towards Minors and Female Employees The Kuwait labour law prohibits the employment of minors under 15. Furthermore, juveniles between the ages of 15 and 18 can be employed only after approval from the Ministry . Furthermore, such underage employees can work under specific conditions. The restrictions include only 6-hour shifts, and they must be made to work at most 4 hours continuously. Also, they cannot be employed in any hazardous activity that could harm their health. Female employees in Kuwait are granted equal rights in the workplace. They are entitled to 70 days of paid maternity leave and additional unpaid leave if needed. The only restriction women have is working during the night shifts from 10 pm to 7 am. Only if female employees are employed in a hotel, clinic, pharmacy, or establishment approved by the Ministry can they work late shifts. Payment & deductions from wages Wages must be paid on time and in Kuwaiti Dinars through bank transfers. The schedule of payment depends on the type of employment. It can be monthly, project-based, or hourly. There are deductions required from expat salaries. However, deductions from Kuwaiti employees’ salaries can be made under specific conditions, such as social security deductions, housing allowances, loans provided by the employer, or court-ordered deductions. Employment Laws Concerning Expatriates If hiring expatriates, you must be aware of various labour laws in Kuwait regarding the same. Expatriates form a significant portion of Kuwait’s workforce, and the country has specific rules and regulations governing their employment. Visa and Work Permits Expatriates can only work in Kuwait with a valid visa and work permit. The visa and work permit can only be obtained by the employer, an organization, or the government. However, expats residing in Kuwait can sponsor visas for their immediate family members, such as parents, spouses, and children. Labour Laws for Expatriates With a few exceptions, expatriates are generally subject to the same labour laws as Kuwaiti nationals. One notable difference is the Kafala or sponsorship system that mandates a Kuwaiti sponsor to work in the country. Also, the transfer of sponsorship, such as in the case of changing employers, is regulated and requires approval from the current sponsor. Approval from both current and prospective employers is mandatory for sponsorship transfer. Expatriate Taxation As mentioned, Kuwait’s expatriates are not subject to personal income tax. However, they may be liable for taxes in their home countries depending on bilateral agreements between Kuwait and their country of origin. Laws on Trade Unions Trade unions are legal under Kuwait’s constitution. However, only Kuwaiti employees have the right to form trade unions. Additionally, Kuwait employment law only approves one union per establishment, and only one federation of unions is permitted at the national level. Laws on Discrimination and Harassment Kuwait labour laws prohibit employee discrimination based on gender, origin, language, or religion. Every employee must be given equal opportunities based on merit and equal pay for equal work. As far as sexual harassment goes, it is illegal. However, there are no particular laws addressing the issues of harassment at work, and as of 2024, there’s growing pressure for more comprehensive anti-harassment legislation. Health Insurance in Kuwait Employers who employ Kuwaiti nationals are entitled to free health care. While healthcare facilities are accessible to all Kuwaiti employees, foreign employees must contribute to the national health insurance scheme for similar benefits, or they can buy insurance from a private insurance provider. Data Protection and Employee Privacy As of 2024, the newly implemented Decision No. 42 of 2021 on Data Privacy Protection Regulation DPPR is the law that ensures data protection and employee privacy. All employers in Kuwait must adhere to the guidelines of the new amendments that require entities “who collect, process, or store personal data, in whole or in part,” must have provisions in place to protect general privacy and specific employee data. Occupational Health and Safety Employers are solely responsible for maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. Under Kuwait labour law, routine checks are performed for all necessary safety equipment and training, and they adhere to industry-specific safety standards. Penalties for Employers' Non-Compliance Non-compliance with labour laws in Kuwait can result in fines, imprisonment, or both, depending on the severity of the violation. Employers’ Repeated offences may lead to the closure of the business. Fines typically range from 100 to 1000 Kuwaiti Dinars (KWD) per violation under the labour laws. Repeated violations can lead to penalties of up to 5000 KWD per violation. Rest Period & Leave Policies in Kuwait Rest Period & Leave Policies in Kuwait Employers should provide the mandated rest period to all eligible employees without failing. Here is the general leave period for each type: Annual Leave: All eligible employees are entitled to 30 days of paid annual leave after completing one year of service. Public Holidays: Kuwait observes approximately 9 public holidays annually, including religious and national holidays. These include: New Year’s Day National Day Liberation Day The Prophet’s Birthday Islamic New Year The Prophet’s Ascension Eid al-Fitr Al-Wuquf Fi Arafa Eid al-Adha Sick Leave: All employees are eligible for up to 45 days of paid sick leave within a year, provided they can produce a valid medical certificate for leave.

Maternity Leave: Kuwait has a robust maternity leave program offering female workers 70 days with full pay as maternity leave. Female employees who have completed at least one year of service are eligible for maternity leave. 30 days of paid maternity leave can be taken before and 40 days after delivery. Hajj leave: Muslim employees who have worked for the employer for at least two years and have not previously performed Hajj are eligible for Hajj leave. It includes 21 days of unpaid leave, once during the entire service period. Bereavement leave: All employees are eligible for 3 days of paid bereavement leave for the death of a first-degree relative and 4 days of paid leave for a spouse. Educational Leave: Kuwaiti employees may be granted paid leave for educational purposes, subject to approval by the employer. Contingency Leave: Employees may be granted leave for urgent personal matters, typically up to six days per year. Employment Contracts & Agreements Employment contracts form the basis of the employer-employee relationship. Kuwait Labour Law only recognizes employment contracts in Arabic. Additionally, these are the specific legal requirements: Types of Contracts 1. Permanent (Indefinite) contracts: These are open-ended agreements for long-term employment. There is no specific end date mentioned. The termination requires notice as per labour law, and any of the parties can initiate it. It is the most common type of employment contract. 2. Temporary (Fixed-term) contracts: These are for a specific duration, usually up to 5 years for expatriates. Such a contract automatically terminates at the end of the specified period but can be renewed by mutual agreement between employer and employee. 3. Part-time contracts: A part-time contract specifying working hours and a compensation structure is mandatory for employees working less than full-time hours. Also, the benefits given to part-time employees are pro-rata. 4. Freelance contracts: Such contracts are utilized by employers to hire independent contractors. Standard labour law protections do not cover such freelancers. 5. Probationary contracts: Employers can use probationary contracts for the initial trial period of a maximum of 100 days. Either party can terminate these contracts without notice during this period. What Should a Contract Include?

In Kuwait, employees receive 15 days’ salary for each year of the first 5 years as a gratuity, followed by 1 month’s salary for each year beyond 5 years. Termination of Employment Under the Kuwait labour law for termination, there are clear guidelines on what is considered a fair termination. Permissible grounds for termination include: Mutual agreement Expiry of fixed-term contract Employee’s resignation Employer’s decision (with notice) Gross misconduct Prolonged illness Business closure or downsizing Employee’s death or total disability An employer must adhere to the abovementioned notice period for termination to be valid. There is no provision for a separate severance pay. Typically, the end-of-service gratuity serves as severance pay unless specified otherwise in the contract. Pension: All Kuwaiti nationals are covered under the social security system. Expatriates are not eligible for pension benefits in Kuwait. Procedures to follow For termination to be fair, employers must: Provide written notice Settle all outstanding payments Issue end-of-service certificate Cancel work permit and residency (for expatriates) Termination Indemnity In unfair dismissal, employees may be entitled to compensation determined by the labour court.

Are there any changes in probation periods or notice periods for the termination in the new labor law? 4. Are there exceptions or special provisions for certain industries or types of employment? Understanding the New Labour Law in UAE 2024 The UAE labor law is established in Federal Law No. 8 , governing the labor relations in the UAE. It is a set of rules and regulations governing an employer and employee relationship. It underlines the regulations of all private sector employers regarding wages, kind of employment contracts, and how disputes between employers and employees are handled. The new labor law UAE 2024 is designed to create a more balanced and fair working environment. The changes also encourage employers to embrace a competitive and flexible labor market that supports economic growth while protecting workers’ rights. Changes in the New Labour Law of UAE The latest UAE labor law introduced several significant changes designed to empower employees and give employers more flexibility regarding working arrangements. Here’s an in-depth look at the critical changes in the new labor law: Salary Continuation During Disputes The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) has included salary continuation during employment disputes to employ the labor force and give employees more power. This amendment can require employers to continue to give salaries to employees for up to 2 months while any disputes are being resolved. This change is significant as it provides financial stability to employees during potentially lengthy dispute resolutions and reinforces the commitment to fair treatment in the workplace. Furthermore, if the parties involved in a dispute don’t settle within 14 days, MOHRE can refer the dispute to a competent court. Probation Period Notice The new labor law amendments in the UAE for 2024 introduce some significant changes in the guidelines regarding the probation period notice. The notice period can be three to six months and will remain the same in 2024. However, now employers must provide a minimum notice period of 14 days before terminating an employee during their probation period. Employees should provide 14 days’ notice if they leave the UAE within their notice period. They should provide one month’s notice if they go to join another company while serving a probationary period. If an employee leaves for another employer during probation, the previous employer can claim recruitment costs from the new employer. Part-Time and Flexible Working Arrangements Previously, only full-time employment was allowed in the UAE. Part-time employment was introduced in 2019, but the 2024 reforms make new work models possible. Now, employers can hire employees for temporary, flexible, remote working, and job-sharing roles. These changes allow employees to negotiate work hours and provide all job roles with the same entitlements. Claim Value Limit for Labour Disputes The new labor law also revises the claim value limits for labor disputes. If the dispute claim does not exceed Dh 50,000, then MOHRE will make the binding decisions. This adjustment is intended to streamline the dispute resolution process by categorizing disputes based on their monetary value. If the dispute amount is higher, then MOHRE can continue to act as a mediator and refer the matter to a competent court if a settlement is not reached. Legally Enforceable MOHRE Decisions New Labor Law UAE 2024 now recognizes the decisions made by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation as legally enforceable. This change strengthens the authority of the MOHRE and ensures that its decisions are ”writ of execution.” The ”writ of execution” serves as a court order giving more authority to MOHRE’s judgments without requiring lengthy legal processes. Statute of Limitation for Labour Claims The statute of limitation for labor claims has been clearly defined as one year in the 2024 amendments. Employees who do not file a dispute within this period lose their right to sue regardless of the claim’s merits. Labour Laws in UAE 2022 vs. 2024 The labor laws in the UAE have undergone significant changes from 2022 to 2024. Here are highlights of the progress and evolution in employment regulations. 2022 2024 Salary Continuation During Disputes No specific provisions ensuring salary continuation 2024 amendments introduced the requirement for salary continuation during disputes for up to 2 months Probation Period Notice No guidelines for employers to provide notice to employees for termination during probation Employers must now provide 14 days notice period during probation period, ensuring that employees have adequate time to seek alternative employment. Part-Time and Flexible Working Arrangements Only full-time employment allowed Flexible working arrangements such as remote work, reduced hours, and job sharing are now allowed Claim Value Limit for Labour Disputes Labor laws did not specify claim value limits for labor disputes 2024 amendments introduce revised claim value limits for labour disputes Maternity Leave Female employees could only have 45 days as Maternity Leave But in the latest law, they can enjoy 60 days maternity leave Emiratisation The private companies with 20-49 employees should hire at least 1 Emirati. This will increase to 2 in 2025. How the New Legislation Impacts Business Practices? The UAE labor law amendments have significant implications for business operations. Companies must adapt to these changes to remain compliant and foster a working environment that respects employee rights. Compliance Requirements Regardless of their employee strength or size, businesses must comply with the new salary continuation provisions, probation period notice requirements, and flexible working arrangements. It requires employers to update employment contracts, HR policies, and administrative procedures. Financial Impact Companies will have to consider the financial obligation while hiring employees on probation with their current employer, as the new amendments give employers the right to seek compensation for the cost of hiring employees who leave during the probation period. Businesses with a large workforce may need to allocate additional resources to cover these potential costs. Operational Adjustments Adopting part-time and flexible working arrangements requires operational adjustments. Employers must develop policies and systems to manage diverse work schedules and ensure high productivity. Potential Liability to Employers The new labor laws also introduce more defined potential liabilities employers can face if they don’t provide workers with certain protections. It is important to know about these liabilities too. These include fines, discrimination, harassment etc. Discrimination The previous Anti-Hate Legislation provided limited protection against discrimination for employees. The new labor law emphasizes non-discrimination and equal treatment of all employees. It protects employees against discrimination based on race, sex, religion, social origin, disability, and national origin. However, any positive discrimination in favor of Emiratis is an exempted category. Fines Non-compliance with the new labor law now can result in hefty fines. Fine ranges introduced in new amendments include: AED 20,000-100,000 for furnishing false information to recruit an expatriate employee AED 50,000-200,000 for illegal employment or recruiting an employee without having any work to provide AED 5,000-1,000,000 for any violation of the UAE Labour Law Harassment While the old labor laws had no anti-harassment provisions, the new amendments underscore the importance of a harassment-free workplace. Employees are protected by sexual harassment, physical or psychological violence, and bullying. According to Article 14(2) of Employment Law and Article 413 of UAE Penal Law, the individuals who are found guilty of sexual harassment may have to face serious penalties like minimum jail sentence of a year, fine of Dh 10,000 etc. Non-Compete Restrictions on Employers The latest UAE labor law includes specific guidelines on non-compete clauses. These clauses must only go as necessary and be reasonable in scope, duration, and geographic area. They should not unduly restrict an employee’s ability to find new employment. The new law also makes the non-compete restrictions unenforceable if the employer terminates the employment in breach of its legal obligations due to the employee. Other ways to avoid non-compete limits include: The Parties' Written Agreement Restrictive covenants can be set aside if both the employer and the employee mutually agree in writing to nullify the restrictions. The written agreement can effectively release the employee from the constraints of the covenant, provided both parties must consent to the agreement for it to be valid. There must be no ambiguity about the intentions of both parties regarding the covenant. Also, the agreement must be documented in writing. Compensation Payment by New Employer or Employee Restrictive covenants can also be set aside if the new employer or the employee compensates the old employer. This compensation typically includes up to three months’ salary to cover the cost of hiring the employee by the previous employer. Termination During the Probationary Period If the employee is terminated during their probationary period, the restrictive covenants cannot apply. The probationary period is typically a trial phase, and employment terms, including post-termination restrictions, may not fully apply if the employment ends prematurely. Termination of Employment Changes Under the New Law The 2024 amendments introduce changes to the termination of employment procedures. Dismissal on Notice Legitimate Reasons for Dismissal Under the new labor law, employees can be dismissed for any ‘legitimate reason.’ This encompasses a broad range of valid grounds for termination, ensuring that employers have the flexibility to manage their workforce effectively. The expiration of a fixed-term contract is explicitly stated as a legitimate reason for dismissal, providing clarity for both employers and employees. Fixed-Term Contract Dismissal Employees on fixed-term contracts can now be dismissed on notice, similar to those on unlimited-term contracts. This change means employers do not need to provide additional compensation beyond the notice period for dismissing employees on fixed-term contracts. This standardization simplifies the termination process and aligns the treatment of different types of employment contracts. Unlawful Victimization The new law explicitly states that victimization, where an employee is dismissed for filing a complaint against the employer, is unlawful. This provision protects employees’ rights to raise concerns and complaints without fear of retaliation, fostering a more transparent and fair workplace environment. Summary Dismissal Expanded Grounds for Summary Dismissal The exhaustive list of reasons for summary dismissal under the old labor law has been retained, with two additional grounds introduced: Abusing Position for Personal Gains: Employees who abuse their position to obtain personal gains and profits can now be summarily dismissed. This addition aims to maintain integrity and ethical conduct within organizations. Unauthorized Employment: Employees who join another establishment without complying with existing controls and procedures can be summarily dismissed. This provision helps prevent conflicts of interest and ensures employees adhere to contractual obligations. Procedural Safeguards Further limitations have been placed on summary dismissal for failure to carry out basic duties. Employers must conduct an investigation and issue written warnings before proceeding with summary dismissal. This procedural safeguard ensures that employees are given fair warning and an opportunity to rectify their performance issues before termination. Entitlement to End-of-Service Gratuity While summarily dismissed employees lose their entitlement to their notice period, they now retain their right to an end-of-service gratuity payment. This change provides a degree of financial security for employees who are dismissed summarily, acknowledging their service tenure despite the summary dismissal. How Employers Can Adhere to the New Labour Law? Adhering to the latest UAE labor law amendments requires a proactive approach from employers. Employers can ensure compliance by understanding the changes, updating internal policies, and ensuring compliance through training and technology. Here are key strategies that employers can implement to adhere to the new labor law: Update Employment Contracts Employers must review their existing contracts and company policies and update them to reflect the new provisions of the 2024 labor law. Clauses for salary continuation, probation periods, and flexible working arrangements must be included in every employee contract. Develop Clear Policies Employers need to develop clear policies that align with the new law to remove any ambiguity or confusion. This includes anti-discrimination, harassment prevention, and non-compete policies. Training and Communication Training HR personnel and managers on the new labor law is crucial. Clear communication with employees about their amended rights and any changes to company policies under the new labor law UAE 2024 is also essential. Leverage Technology Utilize technology to manage compliance with the new labor law. Workforce management software, like Truein, can help streamline processes, ensure accurate record-keeping, and facilitate flexible working arrangements. Benefits of UAE Labour Law to Employers The new labor law focuses on making the UAE compete in the employment market and helping employers attract and retain top talent. A positive and fair work environment enhances the company’s reputation. It makes it more appealing to potential employees. Here are some significant benefits of UAE labor laws for employers: Employers now have the option to terminate fixed contracts without paying additional compensation.

What are the primary goals of the 2024 amendments to the UAE's labor laws? The primary goals of the 2024 amendments to the UAE’s labor laws are to enhance employment rights and increase the UAE’s competitiveness as a prime location for living and working. These changes aim to attract and retain world-class talent by offering improved employee protections, greater flexibility in work arrangements, fair treatment in the workplace, and streamlined dispute resolution processes, fostering a more dynamic and attractive labor market. 2. How will the new labor law amendments impact working hours and overtime regulations? The new labor law amendments promote flexibility and fairness in working hours and overtime regulations. The amendments encourage employers to offer flexible working hours, part-time positions, and remote work options, enabling work-life balance and overall job satisfaction. While the amendments support flexible work arrangements, they maintain the same guidelines for overtime. Employees who work beyond the standard working hours are entitled to overtime pay, calculated based on their regular wages and accurate working hours and overtime records. 3. Are there any changes in probation periods or notice periods for the termination in the new labor law? Yes, the new labor law introduces specific changes and guidelines for probation and termination notice periods. The minimum notice period of 30 days continues; however, new rules are introduced. 4. Are there exceptions or special provisions for certain industries or types of employment? Notably, the law does not apply to employees of federal and local government entities, members of the armed forces, police and security services, and domestic employees. Federal and local government entities’ employees are excluded from the new labor law’s provisions. This exclusion acknowledges the distinct nature of public sector employment, which operates under its own set of rules and regulations. Members of the armed forces, police, and security services are also excluded from the general labor law. Given the critical and sensitive nature of their duties, these personnel are governed by specialized regulations that ensure they meet the high standards of discipline, readiness, and security required in their fields. Domestic workers, including housemaids, nannies, and personal drivers, are excluded from the standard labor law and covered under separate legal provisions. The new labor law also allows for the possibility of future ministerial decisions or decrees that may carve out exceptions or extend certain provisions to these excluded categories.

What is a Labor Management System, and Why Does Your Business Need One? October 7, 2024 Businesses rely on their labor force for company growth and operations. In fast-paced economies like the Middle East, efficient workforce management becomes critical to determine success. It would help to streamline labor management processes as your business grows to ensure that the company’s scaling does not compromise the workforce’s integrity. This is where a labor management system comes into play. A labor management system (LMS) is a robust tool that enables businesses to optimize their workforce, improve productivity, and ensure compliance with labor regulations. With the evolution of the work environment, these systems have become increasingly sophisticated, offering a range of features beyond simple time tracking and scheduling. In particular, companies, establishments, and organizations in the Middle East can benefit from labor management software. With the rapid economic growth in the region in recent years, there has been a tremendous change in workforce management. Even the labor laws are being amended to match the requirements of the modern workforce. As a result, there is an increased demand for more organized workforce management solutions. As your business expands and diversifies, you will need labor management software to maintain competitiveness and efficiency in a global market. This guide discusses LMS and its applications in the modern economy in detail. Table of Contents What is a Labor Management System (LMS)? Essential Components and Features of Labor Management Systems Time and Attendance Tracking Employee Scheduling Performance Monitoring and Real-Time Data Analytics Payroll Integration Compliance and Regulatory Management Mobile Access and Distributed Workforce Management Reporting and Data Insights Employee Self-Service Portals Why Does Your Business Need a Labor Management System?

How does Truein help with labor management and attendance tracking? Conclusion What is a Labor Management System (LMS)? A labor management system is a software solution that streamlines the process through automation and technology. Modern-day LMS softwares are highly robust and covers various aspects of workforce management, including time and attendance tracking, scheduling, performance monitoring, and compliance management. These systems centralize these processes, creating a hub for optimizing labor resources, reducing costs, and enhancing overall operational efficiency. An LMS can be a powerful tool for any organization in the Middle East. Essential Components and Features of Labor Management Systems Traditionally, labor management software focused on workforce time and attendance management; however, today, such systems also encompass various aspects of workforce management beyond just time and attendance. Today, an LMS has several vital components that offer the full set of features to provide a holistic solution for businesses of all sizes and industries. Here are the key features that a robust labor management system offers: Time and Attendance Tracking The core time and attendance tracking feature is available with any LMS. However, the feature’s accuracy, scalability, and integrity have come a long way. Today, these systems leverage cloud technology to accurately record clock-in and clock-out times, regardless of geographical limitations. The advanced algorithms can monitor breaks and overtime. An LMS can help employers identify patterns in attendance and punctuality. They also generate accurate timesheets for payroll processing. Time and labor software like Truein offers advanced capabilities such as face recognition, mobile clock-in options, and integration with existing payroll and HR systems to ensure accurate and tamper-proof time tracking. Employee Scheduling LMS also acts as a labor scheduling software to help businesses maintain optimal staffing levels and control labor costs. This features automatic shift assignments based on employee availability and skills, proactive conflict detection and resolution, and the ability to manage multiple locations and departments. LMS systems can streamline the scheduling process, ensuring businesses have the correct number of employees with the right skills and time. Performance Monitoring and Real-Time Data Analytics Real-time productivity tracking gives managers a more transparent insight into key performance indicator (KPI) monitoring. Simply put, the labor management system goes beyond essential time and attendance tracking to provide insights into employee performance. Payroll Integration System isolation is one way poorly designed systems result in operational and management deficiencies. That’s why modern time and labor management systems offer seamless integration with payroll systems. This enables HR to automatically transfer time data to payroll systems, facilitating accurate calculation of regular hours, overtime, and special pay rates. It eliminates manual data entry errors and saves resources by streamlining payroll processing. Compliance and Regulatory Management Managing labor laws to ensure compliance in the Middle East can be complex for any business, given the diversity of the labor force, markets, and industries. A robust labor management system helps by enforcing compliance with local labor laws based on preset rules. It ensures that workers are meeting the work hour limits and break requirements. This can be particularly useful for businesses operating across multiple jurisdictions. Mobile Access and Distributed Workforce Management With the rise of alternative work arrangements such as distributed workforce, tracking and managing workers has become even more challenging. An LMS overcomes this challenge by offering mobile apps for clock-in/out and schedule viewing. These systems also have GPS and geofencing capabilities to ensure employees are onsite when clocking in. They empower workers by giving them remote access to schedules, time-off requests, and performance data. Mobile access ensures that employers can effectively manage their workforce regardless of location. It also facilitates real-time communication tools for managers and employees. Reporting and Data Insights Comprehensive reporting capabilities are a hallmark of advanced labor tracking systems. Adopting any modern LMS provides you with functions such as customizable report templates, real-time dashboards, and predictive analytics for workforce planning. Such insights are essential for businesses to make data-driven decisions. Employee Self-Service Portals Employee self-service portals are becoming increasingly essential to empower employees to become independent. Features like self-service allow workers to view and manage their schedules, request time off or shift swaps, update personal information, and access their performance metrics. This is a great way to reduce administrative overhead and improve employee satisfaction. Why Does Your Business Need a Labor Management System? If you are unsure if your business can benefit from a labor management system, you still aren’t entirely aware of its numerous benefits. Irrespective of your business size and industry, here are some compelling reasons why it needs an LMS: Enhanced Productivity and Workforce Efficiency The primary goal of a labor-management system is to optimize various workforce management processes for improved productivity and efficiency. Think about it: if your manufacturing unit has data about the workers based on their skills and availability accessible through a central dashboard, how fast and reliable scheduling becomes. LMS provides tools to optimize workforce allocation, ensuring that companies always assign tasks to skillful and available workers. Better utilization of employee skills results in improved overall productivity, reduced idle time, and increased efficiency. Accurate Time Tracking and Optimized Scheduling Labor tracking software boosts accuracy by precisely recording employee work hours, breaks, and overtime. When you combine this accuracy with advanced scheduling capabilities, you get: Reduced time theft activities such as buddy punching Optimized staff scheduling based on demand forecasts Decreased overstaffing and understaffing incidents These outcomes save businesses significant costs and improve operational efficiency. Addressing Growing Complexity and Employee Performance The flexibility and scalability of modern LMS systems support growing businesses and accommodate the increasing complexity of their operations. For instance, a labor-management system warehouse solution helps logistic companies with tools to monitor their distributed facilities and improve employee performance. Warehouse managers can better communicate with their employees using a centralized platform for managing workforce operations. Cost Savings through Overtime Control and Payroll Accuracy Giving better control over workers’ attendance and schedule, a time labor management system helps companies reduce unplanned overtime. Organizations can minimize payroll errors and associated costs by automating time-consuming administrative tasks. These cost savings can be substantial, especially for larger organizations or those with complex workforce structures. For example, if overtime pay is 1.5 times the regular wage on average. Poorly managed overtime can lead to substantial labor costs. Compliance with Local Labor Laws and Regulations One of the crucial benefits of an LMS is it helps stay compliant with labor laws. Through their inbuilt compliance enforcement procedures, labor management systems automatically ensure compliance. It includes automatically enforcing work hour limits and breaking requirements to avoid penalties and maintain a good reputation. It also facilitates maintaining detailed records for audit purposes and remaining compliant with changing regulations. This is a handy feature in the Middle East due to varying labor laws between countries. Real-Time Data Insights for Informed Decision-Making Data-driven decisions eliminate guesswork from workforce management. Modern labor tracking systems provide real-time data and analytics, which allow managers to identify trends and patterns in labor utilization. Real-time data insights help forecast future labor needs more accurately, assisting proactive management and strategic planning. Boosted Employee Engagement and Performance Monitoring An LMS boosts employee engagement by providing transparent performance metrics and ensuring fair and accurate scheduling, both of which help employees feel valued and supported, and enabling open communication between employees and management. As a result, workers are more productive and have higher job satisfaction, leading to lower turnover rates. Industries in the Middle East That Benefit from an LMS Adopting a labor management system can benefit any business, regardless of industry, but some businesses are rapidly implementing such systems in the Middle East. This includes: Oil and Gas The oil and gas industry is the cornerstone of economic growth in the Middle East. A labor management system software helps companies in this sector by: Offering comprehensive solutions for managing complex shift patterns for onsite and offshore workers Ensuring local and international compliance Adherence to strict safety regulations Track specialized workforce skills and certifications Accurate labor management in the oil and gas industry is crucial for both safety and efficiency. Construction Construction labor management software is now a core tool of operations for the booming construction sector in the Middle East. The industry heavily relies on a large labor force, which introduces several challenges. An LMS assists in: Managing large, diverse workforces across multiple project sites Tracking overtime and resource allocation Ensuring compliance with construction safety regulations Enforce local labor laws for the international labor force Optimized labor management is crucial to project success, mainly when construction projects operate on tight deadlines. Manufacturing Manufacturing businesses leverage labor management system warehouse solutions to optimize several aspects of their business. This includes: Optimizing production line staffing Monitor productivity of onsite and off-site workers in real-time Manage complex shift patterns Improve employee satisfaction with accurate attendance and pay As the manufacturing sector in the region continues to diversify, efficient labor management becomes increasingly essential for maintaining competitiveness. Logistics and Transportation Middle Eastern countries need robust infrastructure like other economies to support their growth. This makes logistics and transportation key industries in the industry. LMS systems help logistics companies: Manage warehouse staff efficiently Optimize delivery schedules Track driver hours Ensure compliance with transportation regulations With the rise of online logistics services, there is an increased demand for efficient supply chains, and labor management systems are becoming indispensable in this sector. Tackling Challenges in Deploying Labor Management Systems Implementing a labor-management system offers benefits, but the deployment process demands overcoming some challenges. Here are some of the common hurdles you can face: Understanding System Requirements and Integration Needs LMS systems are robust and have significant infrastructure demands. Before implementing an LMS, you must assess your current workforce management processes to create objectives for the new system. Also, integration requirements with existing systems (e.g., payroll, ERP) must be identified. Working with experienced vendors or consultants can help ensure that the chosen system meets your specific needs. Managing Change Resistance and Providing Training Adoption of any new system can be a source of anxiety and confusion for workers. This is to ensure that employees are not resistant to communicating the new system’s benefits. To avoid alienating workers, comprehensive training should be provided to both administrators and end-users. A phased rollout can ease the transition. Addressing Data Privacy and Compliance Ensure that the chosen system complies with local data protection laws. Also, strong security measures should be implemented to protect employee data by establishing clear policies on data access and usage. As the Middle East has strict data protection regulations, it is essential. Customizing Solutions to Fit Business Needs An existing LMS might have some of the features your business may require. Therefore, look for systems that offer customization options. Work closely with vendors to tailor the solution to your specific processes. Choose a system that doesn’t require over-customizing, as it can complicate future upgrades. Budget Management and Cost Constraints Implementing an LMS can be a significant investment. Consider choosing a solution that offers features tailored to your specific requirements and helps address the problem you’re trying to solve. Do a comprehensive evaluation of features to ensure the system’s potential ROI can justify the investment. Ensuring System Scalability and Ongoing Maintenance Your business will grow, and its needs will become diverse. Choose an LMS that can scale with your company. Only pick a vendor who guarantees regular updates and support to ensure the system will serve your current and future needs. How Does a Labor Management System (LMS) Help With Employee and Labor Relations? A labor management system impacts employee and labor relations in several ways. Successfully implementing an LMS initiates: Transparency: Introducing a system of clear, accessible information about schedules, time worked, and performance metrics reduces misunderstandings and disputes. Fair Treatment: Accurate scheduling and time tracking ensures that company policies are consistently applied for all employees. Communication: Communicating with management improves interactions between managers and workers. It builds confidence, satisfaction, and productivity.

Its development is the result of decades of investment in banking and tourism. A large workforce is needed to support the growing Bahraini economy. The robust and comprehensive Bahrain employment law framework exists to ensure equal rights for all workers. As the economy develops, labour laws also evolve.

Conclusion FAQs 1. What are the standard working hours in Bahrain? 2. What rights, including rights to pay and benefits, does a woman have during maternity leave? 3. What are the rules regarding overtime pay in Bahrain? 4. What rights do trade unions have? Labour Law in Bahrain Bahrain labour law is called the Labour Law for the Private Sector (Law No. 36 of 2012) . It is the primary legislation that all private-sector employers must adhere to as it governs employment relationships in the country. The law sets out the rights and obligations of both employers and employees, covering various aspects of employment, including: Minimum Wages As of 2024, there is no minimum wage requirement for private-sector employers in Bahrain. However, the minimum for Bahraini nationals employed by the government is set to be BHD 300 per month. In addition, the National Employment and Training Scheme sets the minimum wage for public employees depending on their education qualifications. The set minimum wage requirement based on educational qualification is: High School Diploma: BD 300 per month Diploma: BD 380 per month University Degree: BD 450 per month Bonuses No Bahrain labour laws legally oblige employers to provide bonuses to their employees. However, many private-sector employers offer performance-based or annual bonuses as part of their compensation packages. These bonuses can incentivize employees to perform well and contribute to the company’s success. However, at the time of employment, the terms and conditions of any bonus schemes offered should be clearly outlined in the employment contract. Overtime Employers can ask employees to work on a rest day or holiday. Employees in Bahrain are entitled to overtime pay for hours on regular work days and holidays. The overtime pay rate is 125% of the employee’s regular hourly wage for working overtime during the day on regular work days. For hours worked on the weekly rest day (typically Friday) or on public holidays and at night on any day, the overtime pay rate increases to 150% of the regular hourly wage. Leaves and Break Time Under lmra Bahrain labour law, employees are entitled to several leaves. As an employer, you must offer entitled leave depending on your business. Moreover, all employees must be provided a break of at least an hour for prayer intervals, meal breaks, etc. Employees can only be made to work up to six consecutive hours with a break. Working Hours The standard workweek in Bahrain is 48 hours, typically distributed over six days (Sunday to Thursday). Friday and Saturday are considered the weekend, with Friday being the designated weekly rest day. During Ramadan, working hours are reduced to 36 hours per week to accommodate fasting employees. Employment Laws Concerning Migrants/Expatriates Since 79% of the Bahrain workforce comprises expats , employers must know the Bahrain labour law for expatriates. Here are essential labour laws regarding expats to know: Visa and work permits Expatriates must obtain a valid work visa and work permit to be legally employed in Bahrain. The employer is responsible for sponsoring the employee’s work visa. Labour laws for expatriates Unless immigrants work as domestic workers, civil servants, or in public legal entities subject to the Civil or Military Service Regulations, they are protected by the same labour laws as Bahraini nationals. In addition, their expatriate workers, regardless of profession, are not covered by any minimum wage regulations under Bahrain labour law. Expatriate Taxation Bahrain does not impose personal income tax on expatriates or Bahraini nationals. Non-residents’ capital gains or income are not subject to tax or social insurance in the country. Recruiting expatriate talent Employers are mandated to obtain permission from the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) when recruiting expatriate workers. Every expat employee must be registered with LMRA. Additionally, employers must obtain work permits for every expatriate employee separately before finalizing their recruitment. Onboarding Expatriates For the successful onboarding of expats, employers must ensure that expatriate employees have valid work visas, work permits, and health insurance coverage. Flexi Permit The Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) introduced the Flexi Permit in 2017. It is a unique work permit category that allows expatriates to work for multiple employers without being tied to a single sponsor. This permit provides greater flexibility and mobility for hiring expatriates, even illegal workers in Bahrain . Pre-Hire Checks & Criminal Background Checks Employers must obtain approval from the Bahrain Ministry of Interior and the labour Market Regulatory Authority before hiring anyone on local employee contracts. The level of background checks required for employees will depend on the nationality and position of the individual. As such, employers in Bahrain are permitted to conduct pre-hire and criminal background checks on potential employees. However, Bahrain employment law requires employers to obtain the necessary information with the candidate’s consent. In addition, employers must comply with data protection laws when handling the personal information of potential employees. Laws on Labour Unions Bahrain recognizes the right of workers to form and join trade unions. Trade Unions are permissible under the Bahrain labour laws.  The Trade Union Law of 2002 governs the formation, operation, and dissolution of trade unions. Employers must consult with the labour union if they are retraining employees to work in a different role than they were hired for. Also, employees can strike under the protection of labour unions in defence of their interests. Laws on Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Bahrain has strictly prohibited any discrimination or harassment under the labour law. No employee can be discriminated against based on gender, race, language, belief, religion, or disability. The law also prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace and requires employers to take steps to prevent and address such incidents. Furthermore, dismissals based on gender, race, social status, pregnancy, childbirth, or social status will be automatically deemed unfair. Data Protection and Employee Privacy Bahrain has stringent protection laws to protect the data and privacy of employees. Data and privacy of the employees are protected under Law No. 30 of 2018 concerning Personal Data Protection (PDPL). Employers’ collection, processing, and storage of personal data must be only after written employee consent. They must also implement appropriate security measures to protect this data. Employer Obligations and Responsibilities Employers in Bahrain have several obligations and responsibilities towards their employees. Labour Laws such as the Private Sector (Law No. 36 of 2012) and other relevant regulations ensure employees’ rights are protected and they are provided a fair working environment. Work permits and fair job offers Employers must obtain work permits for their expatriate employees and provide fair and accurate job offers that comply with labour laws. All permissions must be obtained from the Labour Market Regulatory Authority. The job offers extended to employees must include: Employer’s name, address, and trade register number Job nature, type, and duration Wage, mode, and schedule of payments Worker’s name, nationality, occupation, qualifications, address, and other relevant personal information Health and Safety Employers are responsible for ensuring their employees a safe and healthy work environment. All employers must ensure their employees’ safety and follow laws laid down under the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) standards set by the Ministry of Labour and Social Development. Social Security Employers must register their Bahraini employees with the Social Insurance Organization (SIO) without failing. Also, employers must make monthly contributions to the SIO for their Bahraini employees. Payment of wages Employers must pay their employees’ wages depending on the schedule mentioned in their contract or type of employment. A detailed payslip must also be provided with pay. Payment of wages can be monthly, project-based, or hourly. Deductions from wages While there are no mandatory deductions from the wages of expats, employers can make deductions from a Bahraini employee’s wages by the law, such as for social security contributions, income tax (for Bahraini nationals), or court-ordered payments. Penalties for Employers' Non-Compliance Employers who violate Bahrain’s labour laws may face penalties, including fines, suspension of work permits, and, in severe cases, imprisonment. The amount or severity of the penalty depends on the nature and extent of the violation. Private sector employers can face fines ranging from BHD 100 to BHD 500 for each employee affected due to violating Bahrain Labour Laws. For occupational Health and Safety Violations, penalties can range from BHD 200 to BHD 500. Court Practice & Procedures A dedicated Labour Case Court handles all employment disputes in Bahrain. Typically, disputes between employers and employees are remedied through a three-stage process: Filing of the complaint Mediation Adjudication The parties are given a chance to settle the dispute during mediation. If no settlement is reached, the case proceeds to adjudication, where a judge issues a binding decision. Confidentiality and Non-Compete Clauses Confidentiality clauses in employment contracts are enforceable under the Bahrain employment law. However, the clauses must be reasonable in scope and duration. Non-compete clauses in Bahrain are also permissible, but they must be limited in time, geographic scope, and the nature of the restricted activities to be considered valid. Rest Period & Leave Policies Employers must maintain compliance with the regulations regarding rest periods and leave policies as laid under the Bahrain labour laws. Here are the entitled rest and leave periods. Public holidays: Bahrain has ten public holidays per year: Eid-al-Fitr Arafat Day Eid-al-Adha Islamic New Year Ashoora Prophet’s Birthday National Day Sports Day Labour Day Little Feast Annual leave: Employees who have completed one year of service are entitled to 30 calendar days of paid annual leave. This leave allowance is in addition to public holidays and weekly rest days. Sick leave: Employees who have worked for at least three consecutive months for an employer can receive 15 days with full pay, 20 days with half pay, and 20 days without pay. An employer can avail of up to 55 sick leaves annually. Maternity leave: Female employees are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave, to be taken before and after delivery. Employees must present a medical certificate issued by a government health center or clinic recognized by the employer. In addition to mandatory paid maternity leave, female workers can obtain an additional 15 days of unpaid maternity leave. Hajj leave: Muslim employees who have completed five years of service with the employer are entitled to 14 days of paid leave for performing the Hajj pilgrimage once during their employment. Bereavement leave: Employees are entitled to 3 days of paid bereavement leave in the event of the death of a close family member, such as a spouse, parent, child, sibling, or relative of a spouse. Educational leave: Employees may be granted paid educational leave for pursuing job-related studies or training, subject to the employer’s approval, provided they provide a 30-day notice to the employer for the same. Contingency leave: Employers must provide employees paid contingency leave for situations such as appearing in court as a witness or performing national service. Employment Contracts & Agreements Under Bahrain’s employment law, the employer-employee relationship is described by employment contracts and agreements. They set out the terms and conditions of employment, including the rights and obligations of both parties. Types of Contracts Permanent contracts Permanent contracts, also known as indefinite-term contracts, are open-ended agreements that do not have a specified end date. It is the most commonly used type of employment contract in Bahrain. A permanent contract provides employees with all the benefits and protections under Bahrain labour law, such as annual leave, sick leave, and end-of-service gratuity. Fixed-term contracts These are the employment contracts with a specified start and end date. Usually, a fixed-term contract can be at most five years. Fixed-term contracts are commonly used for project-based work or for filling temporary vacancies. Termination is automatic after the expiry of the contract unless both parties agree to an extension. Part-time contracts Part-time contracts are agreements where the employee works fewer hours than a full-time employee in a similar role defined by the Labour Law. Such employees are entitled to the same benefits as full-time employees, but on a pro-rata basis, depending on their working hours. For example, if a part-time employee works for 50% of the hours of a full-time employee, they would be entitled to 50% of the annual leave. Special contracts Special contracts, or independent contractor agreements, are used for self-employed individuals who provide services to a company without being an employee. The terms of such a contract clearly outline the scope of work, deliverables, and payment terms. Probationary period According to Bahrain employment law, employment contracts may include a probationary period of up to six months. During this period, either party can terminate the contract with one day’s notice. Notice Period The notice period for terminating an employment contract in Bahrain depends on the employee’s length of service. The notice period is one month for employees who have been employed for less than three months. The notice period is two months for those employed between three months and one year. The notice period is three months for employees with more than one year of service. Gratuity End-of-service gratuity, also known as severance pay, is a lump-sum payment made to employees upon the termination of their employment contract. Gratuity is calculated based on the length of service and final basic salary. For the first three years, it is 4.2% of the employee’s monthly salary, increasing to 8.4%foreach additional years beyond three years. Termination of Employment Grounds for Termination An employment contract can be terminated for various reasons, including: Expiration of a fixed-term contract Mutual agreement between the employer and employee Employee resignation with proper notice Employer termination with valid reason and proper notice Summary dismissal for serious misconduct Notice period The notice period is one month for employees who have been employed for less than three months. Workers are employed for three months and one year; the notice period is two months. The notice period is three months for employees with more than one year of service. Severance pay Employees who are terminated without valid reason are entitled to severance pay in addition to their end-of-service gratuity under Bahrain labour law. The amount of severance pay depends on employment agreement or company policy. Procedures to follow Employers must follow proper procedures when terminating an employee: Provide written notice to the concerned employee Settle the dues owed to employee Notify the relevant authorities about the termination of employment.

Conclusion Importance of Efficient Scheduling Efficient staff scheduling is essential as it can directly impact patient outcomes and operational costs in healthcare. For a long time, hospitals have relied on traditional manual scheduling methods, but these scheduling systems often need to be improved for modern healthcare facilities. Today, staff scheduling software for healthcare must be comprehensive enough to meet the needs of modern healthcare facilities to prevent inefficiencies, errors, and staff dissatisfaction. In this guide, we explore how staff scheduling software for healthcare can overhaul workforce management in healthcare institutions. Staffing Challenges faced in the Healthcare Industry To understand the role of scheduling software in streamlining healthcare staff management, it is essential to know the challenges the industry faces that potentially impact patient care and operational efficiency: Inadequate Staffing The increasing demand for healthcare in the Middle East demands more staff, but moreover, it requires optimizing the existing workforce to maintain staff levels. Another challenge is that inadequate staffing leads to burnout and compromised patient care while overstaffing results in unnecessary costs. Suboptimal Staff Placement Another challenge of medical staff scheduling is matching the staff skills with their shifts. However, matching staff skills with patient needs is complex, especially in extensive facilities with diverse departments. Communication Failures The Middle East healthcare sector has many expats who work as staff in healthcare facilities. With such a diverse workforce, maintaining proper communication becomes a challenge. Poor communication regarding scheduling can lead to missed shifts, confusion about responsibilities, and gaps in patient care. Scheduling Errors and Discrepancies Healthcare facilities face labor cost issues, scheduling conflicts, and management discontentment due to errors caused by manual scheduling. Another challenge is avoiding mistakes that lead to understaffed shifts or double-booking staff. Lack of Scheduling Flexibility Healthcare sector work schedules can be too demanding to ensure 24/7 coverage. Lack of scheduling flexibility can cause work-life disbalance. Maintaining shift schedules that provide work-life balance can be challenging to accommodate manually. Limited Adaptability Healthcare demands can change rapidly, requiring quick adjustments to staffing levels that manual systems struggle to handle. With advanced scheduling software, managing the frequent shift changes will be easier. Mismatch of Skills and Job Roles Ensuring that each shift has the right mix of skills and experience is crucial but easier to manage with advanced tools. The Role of Scheduling Software in Healthcare Healthcare staff scheduling software is a digital solution with features to automate and optimize the creation and management of staff schedules. Unlike manual scheduling tools, scheduling software uses optimized and efficient shift scheduling algorithms. When creating schedules, the algorithms input factors such as staff availability, skills, certifications, and labour laws. This is why scheduling software is robust and highly autonomous. While every industry has applications for scheduling solutions, scheduling software plays a crucial role in managing mobile caregivers in home healthcare. Staff scheduling software for hospitals has become a vital component of the modern healthcare infrastructure by optimizing routes and ensuring consistent care delivery across different patient locations. Key Features of Scheduling Software for Healthcare In the industry, several variations of staff scheduling software for healthcare exist. However, irrespective of the size of your healthcare facility, there are certain critical features that a scheduling software must offer. Here are the key features to look for: Customizable Scheduling Healthcare facilities have fluctuating scheduling requirements. Any scheduling software should allow managers to create schedules based on specific department needs, staff preferences, and facility requirements. Such scheduling flexibility is required to ensure that schedules align with the unique demands of different healthcare settings. Automated Shift Management Automatic shift management reduces the time spent on manual scheduling. Any software you consider should use advanced algorithms that automatically generate optimized schedules, considering factors like staff availability, skills, certifications, and labor laws. Integration Capabilities Extensibility is another feature of quality and robust medical shift scheduling software. Modern solutions can integrate with other systems, such as HR, payroll, and electronic health records (EHR). Such capabilities ensure data consistency across all platforms and streamline administrative processes. Mobile Accessibility Modern scheduling software often has companion mobile apps allowing staff to view schedules, request time off, and swap shifts from their smartphones. A mobile-accessible solution is needed for flexibility and to improve staff satisfaction. Real-Time Updates The software provides real-time updates on schedule changes, shifts, and employee availability, ensuring all staff members have the most current information. Employee Self-Service Portal Due to access through their smartphones, staff can view their schedules, request time off, and even swap shifts with colleagues, reducing the administrative burden on managers. Reporting and Analytics Modern scheduling solutions for healthcare have advanced reporting tools that provide actionable insights. This includes data on staffing patterns, overtime usage, and other key metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making. Compliance Management As the Middle East has significantly varying compliance and labor laws, such software helps ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations by tracking work hours, overtime, and required rest periods. Emergency Shift Replacement In case of last-minute absences, the software can automatically identify and notify qualified staff members available to cover the shift. Such automation ensures that critical medical care is always available. Multi-location Support Staff scheduling software for healthcare, such as Truein, has cloud-based infrastructure, allowing healthcare providers with multiple facilities to manage schedules across different locations, ensuring optimal staff distribution. Benefits of Scheduling Software for Healthcare Staff Any healthcare facility in the Middle East can benefit from Implementing medical staff scheduling software. If you pick a compelling software and implement it successfully within your facility, here are the benefits you can expect: Streamlined Scheduling With so many factors to account for, scheduling in the healthcare sector requires a system that recognizes all the inputs. Any manual scheduling method will fail, but modern medical staff scheduling software simplifies shift planning by automating matching available staff with open shifts. It can quickly generate schedules that meet all requirements, saving managers work hours. Optimized Resource Allocation In healthcare, resources are precious assets as they directly impact the quality of care and treatment patients can avail themselves of. Modern hospital staff scheduling software ensures efficient management of staff availability and assignments. It can identify gaps in coverage and suggest optimal staff allocations based on skills and patient needs. Enhanced Communication Healthcare staff scheduling software facilitates better communication between staff and management. They have built-in features for cohesive communication among teams, departments, and employees. They can automatically notify staff of their schedules, shift changes, or open shifts that need coverage. Reduced Administrative Burden By automating the scheduling process, software solutions help managers save significant time and reduce the risk of errors associated with manual scheduling. By automating scheduling, healthcare facilities can save up to 5 to 10 hours per week. Improved Staff Satisfaction Modern scheduling software can accommodate staff preferences and ensure fair distribution of shifts. This leads to higher job satisfaction and reduced turnover. These systems have features like self-scheduling and shift swapping, giving healthcare workers more control over their work-life balance. Increased Efficiency Automated scheduling is faster and more accurate than manual methods. It allows managers to create and adjust schedules quickly. A health care staff scheduling software can generate optimized schedules in minutes, which could take hours or even days when done manually. Enhanced Shift Coverage Due to their capability to identify potential gaps in coverage, these systems ensure optimal staffing levels at all times. This is particularly helpful in healthcare settings where understaffing can directly impact patient care. As advanced scheduling tools can also predict staffing needs based on historical data and anticipated patient volumes, they help proactively cover shifts. Streamlined Communication Automated notifications and a centralized platform for scheduling information improve communication between staff and management. Most medical shift scheduling software has features to automatically notify staff of new schedules, shift changes, or open shifts that need coverage, reducing the risk of miscommunication. Reduced Scheduling Conflicts Scheduling software can automatically detect and prevent scheduling conflicts, such as double-booking or scheduling staff for back-to-back shifts. This helps prevent conflicts and ensure compliance with labor laws. It also helps prevent staff burnout. Data-Driven Decision Making Advanced scheduling software for the healthcare sector provides detailed analytics and reporting features. Managers can learn about staffing patterns, overtime usage, and other vital metrics. This data can inform strategic hiring, training, and resource allocation decisions. Choosing the Right Scheduling Software for Healthcare: Factors to Consider There are a myriad of healthcare staff scheduling software solutions available. The choice should be based on decisive factors that include: User-Friendliness Advanced systems don’t have to be hard to use. Choose a scheduling app software that offers intuitive and easy-to-use features for staff and administrators to ensure easy adoption. Cost Depending on your requirements, consider both the initial investment and ongoing costs before choosing. The usual scheduling software selection costs include licensing fees, maintenance, and potential hardware requirements. Support and Training Look for vendors that offer comprehensive support and training to ensure smooth implementation and ongoing use. Truein offers extensive hands-on training to all stakeholders using our software, including HRs, admins, and supervisors of the employees. Customization Options Robust scheduling software for healthcare should be adaptable to a facility’s specific needs and workflows. Mobile Access Premise-based scheduling solutions are limited in access. In today’s mobile-first world, robust mobile capabilities are essential for effective staff management in healthcare. Integration Capabilities When choosing software, ensure it is compatible with the existing HR and payroll systems. This feature is necessary to enhance efficiency and data consistency. Reporting and Analytics Advanced reporting tools such as Truein have robust capabilities to provide valuable insights for strategic workforce planning. It includes staffing, overtime, leave management, and more. Steps for Implementation of the Employee Scheduling Software To ensure the successful implementation of hospital staff scheduling software, healthcare providers must follow these steps: Assess Needs and Requirements While healthcare providers’ underlying infrastructure and operational requirements are similar, there are still varying needs. Identify your specific scheduling challenges and requirements to guide your software selection. Select Suitable Software Once you have a clear idea of your requirements and needs, choose a solution that best meets your needs and budget. It would help if you went for customizable scheduling solutions for healthcare like Truein to accommodate your needs. Develop an Implementation Plan This step will require the involvement of IT experts and other stakeholders to create a detailed plan outlining timelines, responsibilities, and milestones. It will ensure that all parties are aware of their responsibilities towards implementation. Customize the Software If the available software does not meet your requirements, work with a reliable software vendor to customize the software according to its features and your specific needs. Integrate with Existing Systems There is no fiscal benefit to implementing a healthcare scheduling solution that doesn’t integrate with existing systems such as HR and payroll. Before finalizing any solution, ensure it is compatible with all other relevant systems. Export Data Ask the vendor to configure the software to allow data to be exported. For instance, we have a data export feature in Truein that enables healthcare providers to export attendance and timing data for payroll calculations and other purposes. Train Staff To fully utilize the features and maximize the benefits of scheduling software for your facility, provide comprehensive training to HR staff, administrators, and supervisors. Launch the Software Do not implement the system facility-wide; instead, roll out the new system with a pilot program in one department. Monitor Performance Closely monitor the system’s performance and promptly address any issues during the initial implementation phase to decide on expansion. Collect Feedback and Make Adjustments Even after complete implementation, you must regularly solicit user feedback and make necessary adjustments to optimize the system’s effectiveness. Future Trends in Scheduling Software for Healthcare The healthcare industry is witnessing transformation under the influence of advancing technologies. The future of medical staff scheduling software will likely be shaped by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning. These technologies enable more sophisticated scheduling algorithms that can self-learn from past data to predict staffing needs and optimize schedules. Also, advanced analytics will help healthcare providers anticipate staffing needs based on factors like seasonal disease outbreaks. IoT devices could provide real-time data on patient flow and staff movements, enabling more responsive scheduling.

New HR Trends for 2025: What Middle East Businesses Need to Know? November 5, 2024 As we approach 2025, the Middle East remains one of the fastest-growing economies but with rapidly changing workforce management trends. Especially in the sectors heavily dependent on blue-collar workers, keeping up with the evolving HR trends is a requirement to remain competitive and efficient. This article explores the new human resources trends businesses in the Middle East should be familiar with. Given the unique economic and cultural landscape, construction, manufacturing, and logistics sectors rely on a diverse workforce comprising expatriates and locals. Staying ahead of these new HR trends will help them have a competitive advantage in talent acquisition and retention. It will also improve operational efficiency through modernized HR practices. Table of Contents New HR Trends of 2025 The Shift to Data-Driven HR Decisions Benefits for Middle Eastern Businesses Overcoming Challenges Flexible Work Arrangements for On-Site Workers Prioritizing Worker Health and Safety Upskilling and Certification Programs Automation of Repetitive Tasks Automation of Administrative Tasks like Timekeeping Focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Evolving Labor Laws and Need to Remain Compliant with Laws Changing Workforce Demographics Strategies to Attract and Retain Younger Workers in the Middle East Challenges and Opportunities for Middle East Businesses Key challenges in adopting HR trends Opportunities for businesses to gain a competitive edge The role of HR professionals in leading these transformations How Has Human Resources Management Changed Over the Years? Evolution of HR from personnel management to human capital management The transition from reactive to proactive employee relations Growth of continuous learning and development programs Expansion of HR’s role in compliance and regulatory adherence Integration of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into HR Practices How does Truein help with employee time tracking and scheduling, with HR and payroll system integration? Conclusion New HR Trends of 2025 Human resource management is one of the core functions of workforce management, which will continue to be the driving force behind the growth of sectors dependent on blue-collar workers. However, this growth can be accelerated by following these trends. The Shift to Data-Driven HR Decisions Flexible Work Arrangements for On-Site Workers Prioritizing Worker Health and Safety Upskilling and Certification Programs Automation of Repetitive Tasks Focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Digital Transformation of HR Functions Changing Workforce Demographics The Shift to Data-Driven HR Decisions One of the most significant new trends in human resource management is the shift toward data-driven decision-making. Data-driven HR uses analytics and metrics to guide human resources strategies and decisions. Industries, particularly those employing blue-collar employees, have long relied on manual methods to make decisions. However, today, leveraging HR technology to gather, analyze, and interpret workforce data enables them to make informed and strategic HR decisions. Today, HR analytical tools can help HR departments predict future workforce trends, such as turnover rates or skill gaps. Additionally, they offer sentiment analysis that can help gauge employee morale and engagement in real-time. Benefits for Middle Eastern Businesses The adoption of data-driven HR tactics can benefit Middle Eastern companies in several ways: It can improve the hiring processes by identifying the most successful sourcing channels and candidate profiles. Help frame retention framework that maximizes worker satisfaction through predictive turnover models. Can enhance workforce planning strategies by effectively bringing data to unpredictable aspects, particularly for projects requiring large numbers of contract workers Overcoming Challenges Implementing data-driven HR will come with some challenges, too. Before adopting technology, you must develop the necessary digital infrastructure. This can add an initial cost to the modernization of legacy systems. Another challenge will be overcoming cultural resistance to data-based decision-making. At the same time, you have to ensure data privacy and compliance with local regulations while handling other difficulties. Flexible Work Arrangements for On-Site Workers In industries such as construction, where on-site blue-collar workers are mandatory, this new HR trend is particularly relevant for Middle Eastern businesses with large on-site workforces. Concepts such as staggered shifts can help balance workload demands while providing workers with more options. This can ensure high retention in industries with fluctuating workloads or 24/7 operations. If your business requires 24/7 operations, then you can implement rotational schedules. Allowing workers to alternate between shifts can provide a better work-life balance. For industries with seasonal fluctuations, offering flexible hours during peak and off-peak seasons can help manage costs while providing workers with more stability. Sectors such as construction and oil and gas should consider offering part-time or short-term contract options to attract more workers. It also provides such companies more flexibility in managing their workforce. Prioritizing Worker Health and Safety This is not a trend but a requirement; your focus on worker health and safety should remain intensified in 2025 as well. Implement robust safety protocols, particularly in high-risk industries like construction and manufacturing. This includes regular safety audits, stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements, and technology for safety monitoring. Another HR trend expected to take centre stage is recognizing the importance of mental health of blue-collar workers, with more companies implementing support programs. Continuous safety training is mandatory to ensure that workers are not prone to risks during their work. This includes both job-specific safety training and general workplace safety awareness programs. It would help if you also had health-focused company policies because, in 2025, the Middle East labor laws will place greater emphasis on worker health and safety. Upskilling and Certification Programs Often an overlooked aspect of blue-collar workforce management, upskilling, and certification programs can help companies in rapidly evolving job markets like the Middle East. Offering trade-specific certifications can help workers enhance their skills and increase their organizational value. It is essential in technical fields like electrical work, plumbing, or specialized manufacturing roles. Building and maintaining an upskilling department within your company may only sometimes be feasible. Partnerships with vocational institutions can provide your workers with accessible upskilling opportunities. It presents opportunities to offer structured on-the-job training programs for continuous learning and skill development. Blue-collar workers who may not have the time or resources for formal education can significantly benefit from such upskilling programs. In 2025, companies across sectors should reap the benefits of the initiatives by Middle Eastern governments to support workforce development. Businesses can leverage these programs to offer subsidized courses to their employees, enhancing their skill sets while managing costs. Automation of Repetitive Tasks Automation is a key HR tech trend in 2025, and it will play a crucial role in transforming how businesses operate across all industries. Companies can save costs by implementing automation for routine tasks. For instance, automation in routine tasks in manufacturing, warehousing, and logistics sectors can significantly increase efficiency and reduce the physical strain on workers. HR digitalization is another automation tool that makes hiring and onboarding processes highly efficient. There are several automation tools available for HR digitalization, including: Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for streamlined recruitment Onboarding Software for efficient new employee integration Payroll Automation Tools for accurate and timely wage processing, particularly helpful for large workforce Performance Management Software for objective evaluations and data-driven decision-making Employee Self-Service Portal for easy access to HR services Time and Attendance Tracking Tools for accurate workforce management Automation of Administrative Tasks like Timekeeping One crucial aspect that all companies in the Middle East should focus on automating in 2025 is the administrative tasks. Highly efficient tools are available to automate routine administrative tasks such as timekeeping. You can adopt reliable time attendance software for accurate timekeeping and significantly reducing errors. Also, labor management systems are becoming increasingly popular for industries with large blue-collar workforces. Focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) In the Middle East, the majority of the workforce is made up of expats. DEI initiatives are gaining traction in the region and reshaping workplace cultures and policies. It is essential that while companies adopt the global best practices, they tailor the DEI initiatives to align with local cultural norms and legal frameworks. This might involve focusing on different aspects of diversity that are most relevant to the region. Some of the ways to build a diverse and inclusive workplace that Middle Eastern organizations are adopting include: Creating and implementing bias-free recruitment processes throughout the company Offering cultural sensitivity training, especially to employees in decision-making capacities like managers and supervisors Creating mentorship programs for underrepresented groups and encouraging their participation in policy framing and implementation Ensuring equal opportunities for career advancement for all workers irrespective of their race, nationality, or gender Companies in the Middle East should be particular about creating inclusive policies for multinational workforces. As the region has significant foreign workers, developing inclusive policies that respect different cultural backgrounds is crucial. It also showcases their progressive hiring and employment conduct. Evolving Labor Laws and Need to Remain Compliant with Laws Staying compliant with evolving labor laws is a critical challenge for HR departments. Due to varying labor laws among countries in the Middle East, it is necessary to maintain a robust compliance framework that can accommodate the evolving laws. These laws in 2025 will focus on worker protection, nationalization efforts, and modernizing employment practices. HR departments must stay informed about the changes in local labor laws in the wake of global incidents and understand their implications. We know that it can be challenging to keep up with evolving regulations. Here are the steps you can take to ensure compliance: Conduct regular legal audits of HR policies and practices to ensure they are in line with the current labor laws Collaborate with legal experts specializing in Middle Eastern labor laws Implement flexible HR systems that can quickly adapt to regulatory changes In this approach, technology can significantly assist in maintaining labor law compliance. Some HR technology trends that will be playing a crucial role in maintaining compliance in 2025 include: Labor tracking systems are specially designed for Middle Eastern industries to monitor accurate work hours. Time and labor management system for comprehensive workforce management, including permanent, contractual, and temporary/seasonal workers Compliance monitoring software for real-time adherence to labor laws Changing Workforce Demographics The workforce demographics in the Middle East are shifting, presenting challenges and opportunities for HR management. The younger generations entering the workforce bring new expectations and work styles. HR strategies must evolve to attract, retain, and engage these younger workers. Strategies to Attract and Retain Younger Workers in the Middle East Hiring younger talent will require some customization to your existing hiring policies. Offering career development opportunities with the roles can make your company a lucrative employer for the new-age workforce that wants skill development at the workplace. Implementing modern workplace technologies will ensure that workers don’t have to deal with redundant systems and get a faster response from the management. Providing flexible work arrangements where possible using shift scheduling software is another way to attract younger talent that prioritizes work-life balance. Emphasizing corporate social responsibility initiatives will present you as a responsible employer who is not a capitalist but instead invested in the development of society. Also, while the focus is often on younger workers, it’s crucial to recognize the aging workforce. Effective succession planning ensures knowledge transfer and smooth transitions as older workers retire. Challenges and Opportunities for Middle East Businesses The Middle East is a dynamic economy with a unique work culture that presents business challenges and opportunities. In 2025, we expect the following HRM challenges and opportunities to require addressing: Key challenges in adopting HR trends Regulatory hurdles: The Middle East is proliferating, and the countries in the region are continuously evolving their labor laws to adapt to such development. For HR teams, navigating complex and rapidly changing labor laws will remain challenging. Cultural resistance: Overcoming traditional management styles and embracing new HR practices is another challenge. A diverse workforce means you must face resistance against HR policies as different cultures deem work culture differently. Technological infrastructure: Investing in and implementing new HR technologies is significant. It requires a substantial financial commitment and, in most cases, an extended period. Skill gaps: Another challenge is training HR professionals in data analytics and new technologies to handle the trends. Opportunities for businesses to gain a competitive edge While the challenges are there, there are also opportunities for growth by embracing the new human resources trends. It includes: Enhanced efficiency through HR digitalization and automation. When companies improve their technological infrastructure, they embrace a global trend crucial for survival and relevancy. Improved employee satisfaction and retention from modern HR practices give companies a competitive edge. In dynamic economies like the Middle East, finding success and reducing turnover can be crucial. Modern HR trend adoption allows for the better alignment of workforce capabilities with business needs through data-driven decisions. Increased ability to attract top talent by offering progressive HR policies is another opportunity to build a reliable workforce and drive growth. The role of HR professionals in leading these transformations HR professionals are not administrative professionals anymore; they are fast becoming strategic business partners in the Middle East. Their role remains crucial in driving the transformation of businesses based on human resources trends. This involves: Developing data analysis skills to drive evidence-based decisions Becoming proficient in new HR technologies to ensure they are making impactful decisions faster and based on accurate data Enhancing change management capabilities to lead digital transformations based on predictive and analytical models Staying informed about global HR trends and adapting them to local contexts to remain relevant How Has Human Resources Management Changed Over the Years? The human resource management domain in the Middle East has transformed over time. The process has been subtle, however transformative across several segments. Let’s take a look at these transformations: Evolution of HR from personnel management to human capital management HR management is no longer about personnel management only; it has transformed dramatically into a strategic function. Today, for organizations in the Middle East, HR is a human capital management avenue that manages workers as a key organizational asset. The transition from reactive to proactive employee relations Modern HR practices focus on proactively addressing employee needs and concerns based on data and real-time digitalization tools. Managers no longer merely react to issues as they arise. Growth of continuous learning and development programs There’s an increased emphasis on ongoing employee development. Unlike before, employers recognize that continuous learning is crucial for individual and organizational success. Expansion of HR’s role in compliance and regulatory adherence HR is not seen as a separate function from compliance. Now, it is part of HR’s duties to ensure organizational compliance with an ever-growing body of employment laws and regulations. Integration of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into HR Practices HR is increasingly involved in developing and implementing CSR initiatives. With the growth of responsible hiring and management, CSR is now recognized as an impactful aspect of employee engagement and company reputation.

It is concerned with the rights and responsibilities of both employers and employees. Companies exploring the UAE industries must understand the intricacies of these contracts. This article will provide a comprehensive overview of a labour contract in the UAE and the essential aspects of drawing a Dubai labour contract. As the UAE progresses towards becoming a more global economy, significant reforms have been made in the country’s labour laws. These changes affect how labour contracts in the UAE are structured and implemented. For employers, a labour contract is essential as it is not only for defining the terms of employment across the Emirates but also for establishing a legal framework for managing their workforce, ensuring compliance with local laws, and protecting their business interests. Table of Contents Types of Labour Contracts in the UAE Limited (Fixed-Term) Contracts: Unlimited (Flexible) Contracts: Part-Time Contracts: Full-Time Contracts: Temporary Contracts: Special Employment Contracts: Job-Sharing Contracts: Limited vs. Unlimited Contracts Part-Time vs. Full-Time Contracts What Constitutes a Labour Contract in the UAE? Key Elements of a Labour Contract Employer and Employee Information Job Role and Responsibilities Salary and Benefits Working Hours and Days Off Currency Arrangements Probation Period Clauses End-of-Service Gratuity Leave Benefits Non-Compete Clauses Legal Rights and Obligations Employee Rights Employer Obligations- Exceptions to Labour Contract Laws in UAE Amendments and Termination of Labour Contracts Amendments to Labour Contracts Termination Procedures Notice Period Requirements: Legal Grounds for Termination Without Notice: End-of-Service Benefits: Labour Contract Disputes and Resolution Common reasons for disputes Resolution Process: What is MOHRE? Recent Updates in UAE Labour Laws Penalties for Non-Compliance Best practices for compliance include: How does Truein Help with UAE labour law compliance? Conclusion Types of Labour Contracts in the UAE In the UAE, several types of labour contracts are recognized, and for compliance assurance, employers must use the correct type of contract depending on the employment scenarios. Limited (Fixed-Term) Contracts: These are the labour contracts that have a specific start and end date. While the duration of limited contracts can vary between UAE States, but it must be between one to three years. Such agreements are commonly used for project-based work or when employers want to limit long-term commitments. Unlimited (Flexible) Contracts: These work contracts are highly flexible as there is no specified end date. However, hiring based on unlimited contracts requires employers to provide a comprehensive contract that correctly outlines the guidelines for either party’s termination. Flexible labour contracts in the UAE are suitable for long-term employment relationships. Part-Time Contracts: Employing workers for hours less than full-time can be done through part-time contracts. These contracts specify reduced working hours and proportional benefits for part-time workers. Companies in the region use part-time contracts to hire atypical workers such as students, parents, or those seeking work-life balance. Full-Time Contracts: Standard employment agreements for total working hours are termed full-time contracts. These labour contracts are typically used to hire workers for 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week. It is the most common type of employment contract in the UAE. Temporary Contracts: Often confused with part-time contracts, temporary contracts are short-term agreements created for a specific task or period. These contracts have clear start and end dates similar to fixed-term contracts but usually have shorter durations. Employers hiring seasonal workers, temporary replacements, or workers for short-term projects can use temporary contracts. Special Employment Contracts: Under the UAE labour laws , employers can use tailored agreements for specific industries or roles, known as special employment contracts. These contracts are often used to hire an employee with distinctive experience at a high post within the company. Usually, this contract is used by government officeholders for appointments. The remuneration and other contract terms are decided by the Ministry of Finance and approved by the Cabinet. Job-Sharing Contracts: It is an arrangement allowing two part-time employees to share the responsibilities of one full-time position. Job-sharing contracts outline how duties and hours are divided among employees. This type of contract is famous for roles that can benefit from diverse skill sets or flexible arrangements. Limited vs. Unlimited Contracts Choosing between limited and unlimited contracts is a common conundrum that UAE employers face. Limited contracts are ideal where the employment period can be anticipated, providing clarity on the duration of the commitment. They are commonly preferred for project-based work or when testing new roles. On the contrary, unlimited contracts have no predefined end date, offering employees more flexibility and job stability. These contracts continue until either party terminates the agreement, following proper notice procedures. While limited contracts can help employers hire skilled workers for a specific period, they need more long-term stability than full-time employees look for. Unlimited contracts offer job stability; however, if employers are not sure of the project timeline or the validity of the role, such a contract can lead to increased labour costs. Another key difference is that limited contracts typically have more stringent termination rules than unlimited contracts, which offer more flexibility but may require more extended notice periods. Part-Time vs. Full-Time Contracts The primary distinction between part-time and full-time contracts in the UAE is based on working hours. Full-time contracts, standard across UAE industries, require employees to work 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week. Any additional hours are counted as overtime. These contracts offer full benefits as stipulated by UAE labour law. On the other hand, part-time contracts, relatively new in the UAE labour market, typically involve less than 8 hours of work per day or less than 48 hours per week. The benefits offered under part-time contracts are often prorated based on the hours worked. The choice between part-time and full-time contracts affects not only the working hours but also the salary structure, leave entitlements, and other benefits. What Constitutes a Labour Contract in the UAE? A labour contract in UAE is legally referred to as an agreement between an employer and an employee that outlines the terms and conditions of employment. Labour contracts are mandatory for offering any employment. They are used to protect the rights of both parties and ensure clarity in the employment relationship. A labour contract is a compliance requirement and a reference point for both employer and employee. Clearly defining roles, responsibilities, compensation, and other key aspects of the job minimizes the risk of disputes and acts as the primary document for resolving issues. UAE labour laws are continuously amended to remain relevant and aligned with global labour policies. The Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021, which came into effect on February 2, 2022, brought significant changes to the UAE labour law. It replaced Federal Law No. 8 of 1980, modernizing the labour regulations, introducing more flexible working arrangements, and enhancing employee protections. Key Elements of a Labour Contract For a labour contract to be valid under the UAE laws, it must have some key elements. Here is the information that should be part of a comprehensive labour contract: Employer and Employee Information Foremost, any valid labour contract must have complete employer and employee information. It must include: Full legal names and addresses of both parties Employee’s nationality and qualifications Employer’s trade license details Job Role and Responsibilities Contracts must have detailed descriptions of the position an employer is hired for, clearly outlining the main duties and tasks expected of them. Additionally, any special requirements or skills needed for the role should be explicitly mentioned. Salary and Benefits The labour contract should include complete information regarding basic salary and any additional allowances. It should also outline the payment frequency and method along with any details of any performance-based bonuses or incentives. Working Hours and Days Off While companies can create their policies around working hours and days off (except the federally designated holidays), employees should be informed about their regular working hours and days in their employment contracts. Terms regarding overtime policies and rates, including weekly rest day(s) and public holiday entitlements, should be mentioned. Currency Arrangements As the UAE has many foreign employees, labour contracts must specify the currency in which salary will be paid to the employee. If a company uses any currency conversion for compensation, it should be mentioned in the agreement. Probation Period Clauses Termination and probation are crucial parts of the employment contract, which is why probation period clauses must be detailed in the agreement. The length of the probation period is an essential piece of information to include in contracts. Typically, UAE allows up to six months of probation, but it can vary depending on company policies. All terms for termination during probation should be outlined, as well as the confirmation process after successfully completing probation. End-of-Service Gratuity Gratuity is a one-time payment employers make to employees to recognize their service. It is a legal requirement under UAE labour laws. Employment contracts should include information about end-of-service gratuities, such as calculation methods and conditions for eligibility and payment. Leave Benefits A labour contract needs to be completed, including details regarding leave benefits. Employers must include the leave benefits offered to the employees, which should include: Annual leave entitlement Sick leave policy Maternity/paternity leave provisions Any other special leave arrangements Non-Compete Clauses For some roles, employers can put a non-compete clause in the agreement. If applied, labour contracts should outline the restrictions on working for competitors after employment ends. Also, the duration and geographical scope of non-compete agreements should be clearly outlined. Legal Rights and Obligations Whether it’s a Dubai labour contract or any other UAE labour contract, understanding the rights and obligations benefits employers and employees. Here are the essential rights and obligations: Employee Rights Minimum Wage: While, unlike the West, there is no universal minimum wage regulation in the UAE, still the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has established minimum salary guidelines for certain categories of employees. It serves as the standard for employers across sectors. Annual Leave: Full-time employees in any sector in the UAE are entitled to 30 calendar days of paid annual leave after completing one year of service. Overtime: For full-time roles, any hours worked outside the regular hours must be compensated at a premium rate, typically 125% of the average wage. Also, night shifts should pay 1.5 times the regular wage rate. Health Insurance: Employers must provide health insurance coverage for their employees. While this rule is only mandatory for employers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, but under the updated laws, all private sector employees and domestic workers in UAE must be paid health insurance from January 2025 . End-of-Service Benefits: As part of their end-of-service benefits, employees are entitled to gratuity pay based on their length of service. Employer Obligations- Providing a safe work environment: Employers ensure workplace safety and provide necessary protective equipment. It also includes providing essential safety training to employees during their onboarding process. Timely salary payments: All employees must be paid on time per the labour contract agreements. Employers must adhere to the Wage Protection System (WPS) . Respecting work hours: There should not be exploitation of local or foreign workers, and employers must adhere to the maximum work hours stipulated by law. Non-discrimination: It is mandatory to ensure all employees are treated equally regardless of gender, race, language, or nationality. Non-Compete Clauses and Confidentiality: UAE labour contracts have scope for non-compete clauses. However, the terms of the non-compete and confidentiality clauses must be reasonable regarding duration, geographical scope, and nature of the restriction. Employers can enforce the confidentiality clauses that employees must adhere to if their roles or responsibilities include handling the employer’s trade secrets and proprietary information. Exceptions to Labour Contract Laws in UAE Labour contract UAE laws are comprehensive. However, there are certain exceptions to special scenarios. This includes: Free Zone Employees: Some free zones in the UAE, such as free trade zones in Dubai, have employment regulations that may differ from those of federal law. Domestic Workers: Most labour contract policies and regulations do not apply to domestic workers governed by a separate law with specific provisions for household employees. Government Employees: Federal and local government employees often have different employment terms from private sector employees. Amendments and Termination of Labour Contracts Amendments to Labour Contracts Labour contracts in the UAE can be amended under certain conditions. It includes mutually agreed upon changes and complies with federal labour laws. Also, any significant amendments in the labour contracts at the company-wide level must seek Ministry Approval from MOHRE. Termination Procedures The termination procedure depends on who initiated the process: Termination by employer: For full-time employees, employers must provide notice as per contract terms (typically 30-90 days). By employee: Similar notice requirements apply as termination by employer. Termination during probation: Employers have the option to terminate any employee under probation without any notice. Similarly, employees can resign with shorter notice periods during probation. Notice Period Requirements: Under the UAE labour law, the notice period is usually 30 to 90 days, but the accurate period depends on the type of contract, the role, and the reason for termination. Legal Grounds for Termination Without Notice: Employers have the freedom to terminate any employee without notice if their activities fall under these categories: Gross misconduct Fraudulent behaviour Breach of confidentiality Extended unauthorised absence End-of-Service Benefits: If the contract mentions end-of-service benefits, employees must be given agreed-upon benefits based on length of service and type of contract. Typically, gratuity is the end-of-service benefit, which ranges from 7 to 30 days’ salary for each year of service. Labour Contract Disputes and Resolution If any labour contract dispute or resolution arises, employers should be able to address them within the law framework. Common reasons for disputes While there can be several reasons for labour contract disputes, the most common ones include: Unfair employment termination Non-payment of wages or delayed payments Breach of contract terms, including non-disclosure agreements Discrimination or harassment at the workplace Depending on the cause of the dispute, managers can take one of the following paths to resolve the issues. Resolution Process: Arrange an internal negotiation between the employer and employee to address the cause of the dispute. If a significant dispute arises, either party can seek mediation through MOHRE. Employees can file a formal complaint with MOHRE if there is no response from their employers. Legal proceedings in labour courts if the issue remains unresolved UAE offers a comprehensive legal proceeding framework for employers and employees. Both have the right to seek legal representation and appeal decisions through the appropriate channels. What is MOHRE?

What are the current scheduling bottlenecks and communication gaps causing resource allocation issues or customer service pain points? Figuring out these issues will help select software with the required features. It should have all the essential functionality requirements for administrative inefficiencies, integration needs, and scalability requirements. Choose the Right Software Make an informed decision based on comprehensive research. With so many options, you should compare available options for features, pricing, customer support, etc. Read user reviews and testimonials to understand regional availability and support. Consider your business size and look for scalability options, pricing tiers, user limits, and customisation capabilities. Set Up the Software Also, look into the device compatibility and system requirements. Cloud-based handyperson business apps like Truein have minimal network infrastructure requirements and better security protocols. Explore employee onboarding features to evaluate how easy creating a user account, access level assignment, and other tools is. Train Your Team Implementing scheduling software will only positively impact your business if your employees can utilise its features thoroughly. Training your employees about the core functionality and operations is a must. Create a common scenario walkthrough and teach them to troubleshoot the most common challenges. Plan update training as needed to ensure they are skilled to handle the software. Import Existing Data If your business already uses any scheduling system, check the data import capabilities of the new system. Ensure data migration does not compromise customer data and employee information. Invest in scheduling software that supports data migration and system integration. Customise for Your Business Customisation might be needed to accommodate the unique needs of your business. Assess and then design workflow configuration for process automation setup for notification customisation, template creation, and report customisation. It may also be needed for system optimisation, such as upgrading existing IT infrastructure and devices. Test the System Start with trial operation before implementing the system company-wide. Core function testing, integration verification, and user experience assessment are the steps that must be followed for performance evaluation of the newly implemented system. Also, gather user input regarding system response and any issues. Launch and Monitor Once the system is thoroughly tested and fine-tuned for your business, you can proceed with business-wide deployment. What’s left is enabling performance tracking and issue resolution protocol to facilitate continuous improvement. Regular reviews should be performed, and the system should be updated for efficiency improvement.

With a first-in and last-out system? Well, that’s perfect for most employees, not all employees. There are times when you want to calculate the actual time spent at work. Not sure what that means? Let’s look at these examples. Table of Contents Scenario One: How can Truein help? Scenario Two: How can Truein help? Diverse system for your diverse needs Scenario One: Imagine your employee comes to work at 9 a.m. and realises he needs to head back home for an emergency. He attends to his emergency chores and comes back at 2:00 p.m. He finishes his work day at 6:00 p.m. and punches out on the attendance system. With the first-in and last-out system, you would see full-day attendance, even when he wasn’t in for half-day. That’s not what you want. How can Truein help? Truein face attendance can track every in and every out in the system and can be configured to calculate time between them. For example, when the employee comes in at 9:00 a.m. and leaves at 9:15 a.m., only 15 minutes get counted. When he is back at 2:00 p.m., the time count starts again. What’s more? An Admin in the Truein portal can override the system calculations if the manager decides to allow a paid time-off . And the logs of the ins and outs stay in the system, always. So if you need an audit trail, you are covered. Scenario Two: Imagine a sales representative moving from one area to another to complete his sales calls. He may mark his attendance at the office in the morning, but end his day with a punch at the distributor’s office in another location. Will the system be able to reconcile his attendance marks at different locations? If not, he may be marked absent and will lose his day’s pay. The situation gets even more complicated if he marks attendance from the Mumbai office for half a month and remaining time from the Chennai office. How can Truein help? Truein can be configured to create multiple site points – one at head office and another at distributor’s office. Attendance at any location will be counted and used for the purpose of compiling work hours. Truein in one-system with the flexibility to have multiple site points with their own rules. If there are site points across regions – Mumbai and Chennai for instance, each site can have their own set of holidays, sick leave rules or overtime policy . The admin does not have to do any manual reconciliation. The system tracks all site points and compiles reports. Diverse system for your diverse needs Configure the Truein face attendance system to match the unique needs of your organization. Customise the system for every branch, every region, every department based on what your system or employees needs are. You don’t have to have one rule – First in, last out for everyone. And you don’t have to do manual tallies across regions. Let Truein intelligently handle it for you! Enjoy the power of attendance automation .

Companies need such labor for flexibility and to aid full-time workers, especially when the project demands too much workforce. In a dynamic economy like the Middle East, you need temp construction labor to scale the workforce up or down based on project requirements. This approach offers numerous benefits, including cost-effectiveness and the ability to access specialized skills for specific tasks. While temporary construction labor offers several benefits, it still needs challenges. From ensuring consistent quality of work to maintaining safety standards and complying with local labor laws, construction companies must know how to manage temporary construction staff effectively.  That’s what this article is about; we will explore the challenges faced when managing a temporary workforce in construction and provide best practices for enhancing efficiency. Table of Contents What Is Seasonal Employment? Challenges in Managing Seasonal/Temporary Construction Workers Demand fluctuations High turnover and inconsistent skill levels Complexities in scheduling and coordination Compliance with labor laws and regulations Ensuring safety and training for short-term hires Budgetary constraints Best Practices for Efficiently Managing Temporary and Seasonal Employees Plan Ahead for Peak Seasons Streamline Recruitment and Onboarding Managing Schedules and Time Off Define Job Expectations Implement Flexible Workforce Scheduling Prioritize Training and Safety Use Technology to Track Attendance and Performance Ensure Clear Communication and Coordination Offer Constructive Criticism Compliance with Labor Laws and Regulations The Benefits of Efficient Temporary Worker Management Improved productivity and project completion times Cost savings by reducing administrative overhead Building a pool of skilled temporary workers for future projects How does Truein help with time & attendance tracking and shift scheduling? Conclusion What Is Seasonal Employment? In the construction industry, seasonal employment refers to hiring labor for specific periods, typically during peak construction seasons or for particular projects. In the Middle East, construction companies must choose their working hours wisely due to the brutal heat and adverse weather conditions. Therefore, in the Middle East, the increased project demands align with periods of more favorable weather conditions. This leads to seasonal employment trends, which results in demand for temporary construction labor around specific periods. Seasonal workers are distinct from permanent employees, who are hired for a predetermined duration. Such workers know their employment will end once the season or project concludes. Challenges in Managing Seasonal/Temporary Construction Workers For construction companies, managing seasonal/temporary construction labor requires anticipating challenges that can arise and proactively addressing them. Here are the most common challenges construction companies can face: Demand fluctuations Construction projects are notorious for varying demands throughout different phases. You require different types and numbers of workers depending on the project phase. For instance, the foundation phase might need more general laborers, while later stages could require specialized technicians. Similarly, seasonal fluctuations in construction activity, market volatility, and project overlaps can cause demand fluctuations. High turnover and inconsistent skill levels The transient nature of temporary work presents another challenge. This presents hiring challenges due to frequent workforce changes and varying levels of expertise among workers. One batch of temp laborers might not be as skilled as the others. Complexities in scheduling and coordination Balancing the schedules of temporary workers with project timelines can be logistically challenging. Temporary construction workers often commit to more than one project, which makes it difficult to have any flexibility in their schedules. This also makes it challenging to coordinate the availability of specialized temporary construction staff with specific project phases. Compliance with labor laws and regulations Ensuring adherence to local labor laws, particularly in the Middle East, is difficult. Labor laws can vary significantly between different Middle Eastern countries. It requires construction companies to be well-versed in multiple regulatory environments, as regulations for temporary workers can be strict. Ensuring safety and training for short-term hires Construction work is a high-risk avenue, which is why workers should be trained about safety protocols. However, maintaining high safety standards and providing adequate training for workers who may only be on-site for a short period is not economically feasible. The challenge is to ensure safety and training for short-term hires within budget constraints. Budgetary constraints Managing labor costs effectively while working with temporary construction labor presents unforeseen variables. Due to the high turnover, demand fluctuations, and skill inconsistencies, ensuring project quality and timelines are met within budget becomes complex. Best Practices for Efficiently Managing Temporary and Seasonal Employees Now that we know the challenges associated with temp construction labor, let’s explore how some of the largest construction companies manage these challenges. Plan Ahead for Peak Seasons You cannot be proactive enough with seasonal workers. As mentioned, construction activities in the Middle East face a unique seasonal fluctuation, but it is easy to anticipate. For effective management of temporary construction staff, construction companies should analyze historical data to predict labor needs for upcoming seasons. Then, based on project timeline and budget, they can contact reliable sources of temporary construction labor to ensure quick access to qualified workers when needed. Streamline Recruitment and Onboarding With efficient recruitment and onboarding processes, you can quickly address any challenges integrating temporary construction labor into ongoing projects. To achieve this, software tools such as HR and payroll can streamline recruitment, allowing for quick identification and hiring of suitable candidates. To minimize the onboarding time, tailor the process for temporary workers. For instance, onboarding can cover essential company policies, safety procedures, and project-specific information and skip through the payment or overtime regulations that concern permanent employees. Managing Schedules and Time Off Seasonal labor in the construction industry poses challenges that require effective schedule management. To overcome the challenges of a fluctuating workforce, implement a clear policy for requesting time off, ensuring it aligns with project needs. This has to be customized for each project. You can use scheduling software to manage shifts efficiently, accounting for worker availability and project requirements. Define Job Expectations There is no scope for confusion; the temporary construction labor must know their role and job duties to maximize efficiency. Have detailed job descriptions outlining tasks, performance expectations, and project timelines. Managers should conduct brief orientation sessions to familiarize temporary workers with their roles and responsibilities within the larger project scope. Implement Flexible Workforce Scheduling Flexibility, as well as the fluctuation in season workforce scheduling, can be minimized by utilizing technology. Scheduling software can significantly enhance efficiency by allocating labor based on project timelines and skill requirements. Such systems allow for easy adjustments to schedules as project needs evolve. Choose a scheduling system that can integrate with other time-tracking tools for seamless management of hours worked and payroll processing. Prioritize Training and Safety The safety of the temporary construction staff is closely associated with the safety of the permanent workers and the entire project. Therefore, maintaining high safety standards and ensuring adequate training for temporary workers is paramount. However, you cannot offer seasonal/temporary construction workers a full-scale training program. You should develop short but focused safety and skill training programs tailored for new hires based on their job-specific skills. Use Technology to Track Attendance and Performance Tracking time and attendance of temp construction labor is crucial for managing the workforce and keeping labor costs in check. Adopt time-tracking tools and attendance software to record work hours and ensure compliance with labor regulations accurately. Modern time and attendance systems like Truein have GPS geofencing features and central management capabilities. It allows managers to record, track, and monitor the time and attendance of construction workers across several sites from a central dashboard. These tools feature robust analytics capabilities too. Features like mobile apps take worker communication and task management to the next level, allowing for real-time updates and efficient coordination. Additionally, utilizing HR and workforce management software can ease handling seasonal hires infinitely.  These systems automate the onboarding process, including document collection and verification. Managing payroll and benefits administration for temporary workers becomes much easier due to the high automation of processes. Furthermore, they facilitate compliance with labor laws by maintaining accurate work hours, breaks, and overtime records. Ensure Clear Communication and Coordination Effective communication is critical to managing temporary construction staff. There must be clear lines of communication between managers, supervisors, and temporary workers. Construction companies should implement mobile apps or platforms that allow real-time updates on project changes, safety alerts, or task assignments. Establish protocols for conducting regular briefings or toolbox talks to keep all workers informed of project progress and upcoming tasks. Offer Constructive Criticism Temporary workers may not perform up to the mark initially. To bring them up to speed and improve performance, conduct regular performance reviews, even for short-term workers. Based on the feedback, offer constructive feedback promptly, focusing on specific behaviours or skills that can be improved. Ensuring Legal Compliance Regardless of what tools you utilize or protocols you implement, ensure that all your activities adhere to legal requirements. This is crucial when managing temporary construction labor. Stay informed about local labor laws and regulations regarding temporary workers in the Middle East. It includes ensuring all contracts and payment structures comply with legal requirements and maintain accurate work hours records. Compliance with Labor Laws and Regulations Compliance with labor laws and regulations regarding temporary construction labor in the Middle East can be much more challenging. The region is formed by several countries, each with its own set of labor laws. Contracts and Payments : Ensure all employment contracts for temporary workers meet local labor law requirements. Arabic is the only legal and acceptable language for contracts in the Middle East. You can provide workers with a translated contract copy, but only Arabic copies are permissible in court. Also, contracts must have clear stipulations such as duration, working hours, overtime rates, and termination conditions. Visas and Permits: The visa and work permit requirements for temporary workers vary depending on the regions of the Middle East. Each country has specific regulations, for instance: UAE: Temporary work permits have a maximum validity of six months. Saudi Arabia: Short-term work visas are available in the country, which allows holders to work up to 90 days. Qatar: Temporary work visas can be issued for up to 90 days. The documentation requirement for visas and permits will vary depending on the type of skill and employment. Health and Safety Regulations: Construction companies must adhere to health and safety regulations in the Middle East. This includes: Provide mandatory safety training to all temporary workers before they start working for the company. Providing proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and ensuring workers wear them while working. Conduct regular safety inspections and address any safety hazards or issues promptly. The Benefits of Efficient Temporary Worker Management Construction companies can benefit by implementing the best practices for managing temporary construction staff. Improved productivity and project completion times Companies can efficiently allocate labor resources based on project needs with effective temp construction labor management. This boosts productivity and reduces downtime due to better scheduling and task management. Furthermore, you can quickly scale the workforce up or down as project demands change. Cost savings by reducing administrative overhead Construction companies can optimize workforce management processes by utilizing time and attendance management tools and HR software. It results in a reduction in administrative overhead through streamlined processes. It optimizes the labor cost by matching the workforce to actual project needs. Building a pool of skilled temporary workers for future projects When tracking productivity and monitoring project requirements, you can always identify and retain high-performing temporary workers for future projects. You do not have to depend on an external source. You can create a database of skilled workers with specific expertise for quick deployment.

They are tracked through manual registers and their documents lie with the contractor agency. Sounds familiar? You don’t have to row in the same boat. There are solutions to ensure that even contract staff is onboarded efficiently. Every step in the process can be transparent and easily backtracked. Let’s jump straight in and uncover some secrets. Table of Contents Tip 1: Let the contract workers self-onboard themselves Tip 2: Register the contractor agency in your attendance system Tip 3: Onboard just once Tip 4: Manage their shifts automatically Tip 5: Contract staff rules and compliances can be complicated. Make it easy for them. Tip 6: Let them mark attendance on day one even remotely Single source of truth Tip 1: Let the contract workers self-onboard themselves When it comes to contract staff, you don’t really know how long they will stick around. You may want to avoid time spent on creating ID cards. Afterall, you might see a new face tomorrow at your construction site or retail store. How can you make the onboarding hassle-free? Simply ask the new staff to register their selfie on your face detection attendance system . Their face is their ID. Tip 2: Register the contractor agency in your attendance system It is a big process to get documents from the new contract staff, scan them and store them in the system. Companies outsource this to agencies but they lose transparency and efficiency. The documents are stored in an inefficient physical or digital folder system. It is not easy to pull the documents out when you need them. Are you running a risk? You sure are. You don’t know who turns up at your office everyday for work. There can be legal hassle eventually. You can have all documents handy right in your attendance system. Simply share access to your attendance admin portal with your contractor agency. You can check if the agency is using any contractor time-tracking apps . Maintain just one system of truth. Tip 3: Onboard just once A contract worker working with you a year back may come today. Do you onboard him again? No. Save yourself and the worker this hassle. Your attendance system can have an easy deactivation – activation feature which lets you accept old employees back in the system. And guess what? It has his past attendance records so you know his track record. Besides, his documents and every other detail is handy already. You can welcome old employees back within a day. Be agile with efficient attendance systems Tip 4: Manage their shifts automatically Don’t let your contractor workers struggle with information on their ever-changing shifts. Nor should you suffer trying to allocate shifts to them. Try to bring in an attendance system that allows you to automatically assign shifts based on punch-in times or based on admin configurations. They can see their allocated shift in the system too. If payments are based on shifts, an automatic calculation based on records in a face attendance system can be a blessing. Tip 5: Contract staff rules and compliances can be complicated. Make it easy for them. You can set your face attendance system to include all the rules you want according to the company overtime policy . For example, mark half day after 1 p.m., pay overtime after 9 hours, mark late after 9 a.m., give public holiday on 26th January and so on. The attendance system can do all the tracking and provide full reports. You don’t have to ask the contract worker to manually track all of it and your admin does not have to reconcile everything manually. Onboarding a contract staff has never been so easy. They just show up everyday to work – the rest is taken care of by advanced face attendance systems. Tip 6: Let them mark attendance on day one even remotely You don’t have to ask contractor workers to report to head office on their first day if their actual site is somewhere in the field. They can mark selfie attendance from app based attendance systems . They just need their own smartphone or a simple tablet at the site office. It is especially true in case of advanced face attendance systems like Truein. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Single source of truth Most companies have a very clear onboarding process for new employees but they don’t apply the same rigour to contract staff onboarding . The agencies they outsource to do not have advanced systems either. Face attendance systems like Truein bring transparency, automation and compliance to the process and it can be shared with staffing agencies. One system of truth for everything from onboarding to attendance and reporting makes the entire system efficient. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

Table of Contents What is a Facial Recognition Time Clock System? How Facial Recognition Works? 8 Advantages Of Using Face Recognition Time Clock System 1. Automated Time Tracking System 2. Cost-Effective 3. Touchless Sign In System: A Post Pandemic Requirement 4. Facial Recognition With Ageing Changes and Accessories 5. More Accurate and Better Worker Attendance 6. The Ubiquity Of Cameras On Mobile Devices 7. Easy To Manage 8. Smart Integration Applications of Face Recognition Time Clock System Conclusion What is a Facial Recognition Time Clock System? Simply put, a face recognition time clock makes use of facial recognition technology to identify and verify a person and mark attendance automatically. Fingerprint scanning systems are almost the standard for attendance systems but the recent struggle with the pandemic has brought forth the issue with systems that require physical contact. A facial recognition time clocking system is a contactless technology that provides freedom from any physical interaction between the man and the machine. It is much easier to understand how a time clock system with face recognition can make the clock-in and clock-out easier if we know how the technology works. How Facial Recognition Works? A facial recognition software captures and compares patterns on a person’s face and analyses the details to identify and verify the individual. While the underlying system is complex, the whole technology can be broken down into three steps: Face Detection: An essential step is locating human faces in real-time Transform Data: Once captured, the analogue facial information is transformed into a set of data or vectors based on a person’s facial features Face Match: The system matches the data above with the one in the database for verification Almost every big tech company including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Cisco is leading the effort to make face recognition more mainstream. There are many reasons to adopt the technology. 8 Advantages Of Using Face Recognition Time Clock System Apart from being efficient, self-managed, and highly scalable, these systems offer unmatched advantages. 1. Automated Time Tracking System Entry and exit time monitoring done manually or with other biometric systems can be fully automated with a facial recognition time clock system. There is no need for human intervention or physical validation as the system’s advanced algorithms can locate and identify faces autonomously. It is effortless to track the working time, clock in and clock out for employees with facial recognition. 2. Cost-Effective A facial recognition time clock system can save business resources by automatic employee time tracking. A solution like Truein can be used on mobile devices making it more affordable for small-scale and medium businesses. Irrespective of the business size, such a time clock system can: Increase employee productivity by 10% Cut administrative costs by 5-10% Save 15% supervision time, helping supervisors with attendance control The cost savings are even higher as data received from the face recognition-based time clock system is in real-time and valid. 3. Touchless Sign In System: A Post Pandemic Requirement Pandemics like Covid 19 can be better managed by minimizing physical contact in public places and work environments. Post pandemic there has been a significant increase in demand and adoption of contactless technologies. The industry has recognized the benefits of facial recognition and the adoption of a time clock system like Truein. Workplaces and multi-tenant environments can greatly reduce the frequency of contact between individuals, thus minimizing the risk of virus transmission. 4. Facial Recognition With Ageing Changes and Accessories Face recognition time clock systems are not dependent on a few facial features but they are highly robust and identify a face on several data points. Therefore, these systems can screen for face masks and identify people without removing the mask or any change of facial attributes like beard, specs etc. It is a major advantage over any other biometric system as employees don’t have to take off their masks. Modern-day time clock systems use highly accurate face recognition algorithms that can also track changes in facial attributes like glasses, beards, hats, etc. 5. More Accurate and Better Worker Attendance Industrial floor time frauds are common worldwide and one of the most common work ethics violations. While a vast majority of workers are honest, but the nuisance of buddy punching cannot be ruled out. Teaming up with staff members or security personnel, some workers skip work and still get paid. Such time fraud is not only detrimental to companies but is also unfair towards honest contributing workers. With a face recognition time clock system, the entire environment is automated. You won’t just take the attendance but also automatically record the entry-exit time of the employees. It also adds to the security of the workplace as the system can recognize who left the designated area and when accurately. 6. The Ubiquity Of Cameras On Mobile Devices Systems like Truein make use of mobile devices for time and attendance using facial recognition . Nearly all smartphones, tablets, and laptops have built-in front-facing cameras. This implies there is no need for any additional hardware to implement a facial recognition time clock system. This is cost-effective and convenient as compared to other biometric systems like fingerprint scanners. As every employee is already accustomed to the use of the front-facing camera on their mobile device, there is no need for any training or orientation for work-from-home employees. These systems have intuitive UI, easy for anyone to use. 7. Easy To Manage As compared to manual attendance systems, AI-based time clock systems are highly automated. These systems store and update day-to-day records in real-time. From maintaining daily check-in and check-out time to preparing high-accurate timesheets for individual employees, facial recognition time clock systems are programmed to handle it all on a very large scale. Imagine handling a large crowd of 10,000 people without any fuss and recording the attendance in an organized manner. Such is the efficiency of the AI facial recognition time clock system. 8. Smart Integration Integrating a face recognition time clock system with any other HRMS or Payroll system is quite easy. As these systems are modular and highly customizable, the time-in time-out and date formats can be customized to be compatible with other systems implemented in an organization. It makes organizing data a lot easier. Also, the time zone settings can be easily changed as per geo-location that making it possible to use software worldwide without any additional requirement. A company with geographically distributed offices can implement a GPS-based attendance system for attendance monitoring in all the offices. Applications of Face Recognition Time Clock System Attendance and Leave Management : The most obvious application of these systems is for attendance recording and leave management . As these systems work on face identification, they are immune to malpractices like buddy punching and timesheet manipulation. Access Control : Face recognition time clock systems can also be used for access control applications, such as office access and computer login.

What Is Buddy Punching and How To Prevent It? June 25, 2024 Like most businesses, you also want your employees to be cordial and look out for one another. What to do when some employees start exploiting this relationship and start punching each other in and out at work? This is known as buddy punching or buddy clocking where some employees may illegally punch in for other employees. As a business owner, It isn’t a pleasant experience to realize your employees are committing time theft, it creates a culture of dishonesty, and you can end up paying for work that was never done. In the United States alone, it is estimated that time theft is costing businesses $50 billion annually. Table of Contents What is buddy punching? Negative Effects of Buddy Punching: More than just extra business cost Rise in buddy punching culture Low morale for high performing staff How to prevent buddy punching at work 1. Have a strict zero-tolerance policy 2. Install CCTV 3. Update legacy attendance systems with modern attendance systems 4. GPS Tracking 5. Geofencing 6. Try Truein Solutions Conclusion Frequently Asked Questions Is Buddy Punching Illegal? How should you tackle/deal with employees who have been caught buddy punching? What industries can most benefit from the prevention of buddy punching? What is buddy punching? Simply put, buddy punching is when one employee clocks in for another employee and does attendance punching on their behalf. This is a common occurrence in instances like when an employee is running late and asks a colleague to clock in for them to avoid notice or detection by the floor manager or supervisor. According to a 2017 Pollfish survey involving 1,000 employees, 16% admitted to buddy punching. Furthermore, the study also found that the most common mistake committed while submitting timesheets is employees adding an extra 15 minutes to their clock time. This might not seem like a challenge, but when you put things into perspective you realize the deeper consequence this can have on the annual payroll bill. The latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicates that there are more than 78 million hourly workers currently. If we assume that 16% of them participated in buddy punching and added 15 minutes to a co-worker’s timesheet, this will end up adding more than $373 million to the employers’ annual payroll bill. In some extreme cases, some employees use buddy punching to take entire days off work without getting caught or accrue extra overtime. This not only tricks employers into paying for large chunks of time employees have not worked for, but is also detrimental to the morale of an honest workforce. Whether you are a large enterprise or a small business with tight margins, buddy punching is time theft and dishonesty that must be dealt with. Negative Effects of Buddy Punching: More than just extra business cost The cost implication is not only the negative impact buddy punching has in the workplace, there are many more. If you are not able to prevent buddy punching it can correlate with the following problems in your workplace. Rise in buddy punching culture When new team members witness seasoned employees participating in time theft, they think of it as a norm. Especially, if there is no feedback around buddy punching, employees will feel it acceptable to continue to do so. This will also result in slacking on their responsibilities. Low morale for high performing staff Employee absenteeism due to buddy punching puts pressure on the rest of the workforce as they need to pick up the slack and do extra work. This is outright unfair for honest employees who exhibit strong performance. They are compensated the same amount for all the extra work. Lack of equal treatment and fairness is one of the major reasons for employee turnover in the workplace. How to prevent buddy punching at work 1. Have a strict zero-tolerance policy The most effective way to eliminate buddy punching is to address it head-on without showing any leniency. Putting a formal buddy punching policy in place will ensure your employees are aware of the consequences they can face. Having a clear zero-tolerance policy will also let the new employees know of the stance the company has against time theft. If you do not have a zero-tolerance policy already in place, work on one, print it out and put it where all staff can see it. A formal buddy punching policy also gives grounds for termination. 2. Install CCTV A seemingly simple solution to prevent budding punching is to record who is clocking in. Installing CCTV cameras at the right places, you can verify whether the employee was present at the time and place when they were clocked in or clocked out. While this solution seems simple, it has its shortfalls. Primarily monitoring CCTV footage is a time-consuming task. It is a full-time task to figure out who is where and at what time. Also, the cameras and other equipment require frequent maintenance. As all the components are serialized, even if one breaks down everything can stop working. 3. Update legacy attendance systems with modern attendance systems While card punching systems are a norm, they do leave a lot of scope for time theft. Biometric attendance systems offer an excellent improvement. As it requires thumbprints, face recognition or retinal scans to clock in an employee, it is a failsafe mechanism to ensure that the right employee is clocking in. With biometric clocks employees were able to limit time theft to only 3% of the employees of the total who were buddy punching previously. Face recognition attendance systems make time theft virtually impossible and can keep employees from abusing the timekeeping system. To better adapt to the needs of a contact-free work environment in the post-pandemic era there are touchless face recognition based employee attendance systems available like the one offered by Truein. 4. GPS Tracking In workplaces where employees roam over a larger area, preventing buddy punching can be challenging as managers need more resources to track employees. An easy solution is to use timekeeping software and mobile GPS. Such systems can track an employee’s location as well as their hours. Timekeeping solutions with inbuilt GPS tracking and/or geofencing are available, which allow an employee to clock in only when they are within a certain radius of the business. GPS tracking employees for timekeeping is not expensive as GPS can be activated on their smartphones. 5. Geofencing A more restricted and arguably the most effective way to manage employees and avoid buddy punching is geofencing. As geofencing relies on GPS, WiFi and cellular data, it can create an invisible barrier within which a person can clock in. You can decide at what distance you want your employees to be able to clock in, be in the parking lot or the front door. Once this digital barrier is set, employees can mark attendance only when they are inside. You can enable automatic punching for employees when they are within a certain distance or allow manual clock in through an app. With geofencing, employees cannot clock in when they are away from work, or can’t be buddy punched by any other employee. 6. Try Truein Solutions A company focused on providing seamless staff attendance, Truein leverages the advancements in Artificial Intelligence technologies to prevent the menace of buddy punching. Their touchless face recognition based employee attendance system enables employees to clock in using their phones or tablets. There is no complicated hardware needed to implement their attendance system. Truein’s attendance system also offers selfie-based geofencing, leave management and automated reports.

You must take a closer look at your attendance policy to ensure that it is fair towards employees and not too constrictive. Still, buddy punching can be the Achilles’ heel for any business and must be prevented. Having an effective attendance solution that relies on modern technologies like AI, facial recognition and geofencing are recommended to prevent negative impacts on productivity and costs. Frequently Asked Questions Is Buddy Punching Illegal? The legal policies governing how companies handle buddy punching vary by state and country. However, in most cases, time theft through buddy punching does constitute fraud and can be ample grounds for termination without warning. How should you tackle/deal with employees who have been caught buddy punching? Most employees practising buddy punching are found to have a sense of entitlement. Rather than terminating their employment, you must issue a warning notice. Also, establish clear communication feedback where managers can explain the consequences of buddy punching to their teams. What industries can most benefit from the prevention of buddy punching? Retail, construction , hospitality and information technology witness buddy punching more than any other industry.

Indeed, it is if you have only a few employees. As more people join your team, leave management gets painstaking and ultimately deviously complicated when more people join in. This is why a leave management system is a worthwhile addition to your business tool to manage risks and avoid costs. In this article, we will cover all aspects of an employee leave management system so you can benefit your business as well. Table of Contents What is an employee leave management system? Why leave management is important? 6 Advantages Of Using A Leave Management System 1. Significantly less paperwork 2. Auto-update leave balance 3. Real-time information and updates 4. Save the time of administration 5. Transparent and accurate 6. Easily Manage Holidays Truein: An Attendance System With Leave Management Solution What is an employee leave management system? Leave management is more than just keeping the count of days an employee has taken leave of absence. An online leave management system is a tool to keep track of types of leaves -stipulated, medical, casual. Some leaves are planned, some are unplanned but monitoring leaves for all employees is needed for the proper functioning of the organization. A leave management system is a comprehensive system that can entirely automate the HR task of tracking leaves consumed by employees. Employees can easily put in an application for leave along with supporting documents. Furthermore, a leave management system can be made an integral part of the whole HR Management System such that complete employee management can be done from a single dashboard including payroll, attendance, rosters, etc. There are two types of leave management system – A manual leave management system where a physical log book is maintained and employees sign in & sign out at the start and end of day. This is tallied manually at the end of the month to calculate the number of leaves that an employee has taken. The process is cumbersome and far more prone to errors. The second is an automated leave management system where a biometric such as fingerprint or face recognition is utilized and the employee in and out times are automatically logged in & stored on the cloud. Leave reports can be automatically generated at the end of each day/month and given its efficiency, accuracy & ease of use, increasingly organizations are replacing manual leave management systems with automated leave management system . Why leave management is important? Employee leave management system is important to enforce a leave policy at the workplace. It helps with record-keeping to allow organizations to effectively offer benefits like paid leaves. Modern-day face recognition based attendance system like Truein can keep employee leave stats so they are aware of leave balance and entitlements right on their mobile screens. Such systems also help companies stay compliant and get a holistic view of the trends in leaves and attendance through reporting and analytics. Essentially, a leave management system can help you take corrective or preventive measures when needed. Furthermore, the leave management system helps stop revenue leaks. Without a maintained and updated leave record, companies can end up paying for the absences. It also helps avoid confrontations between employees and the employer benefiting the brand image. For smooth business functioning, it is important to ensure that the employees taking leaves do not become a reason for business losses. The best way to achieve this is to check the rooster to approve or reject a leave after evaluating the impact on the work. 6 Advantages Of Using A Leave Management System 1. Significantly less paperwork One of the benefits of using software tools is the reduction of dull and repetitive tasks. An online leave management system offers integration and automation that significantly reduces the amount of paperwork. A paper trail of leave management is cumbersome as well as a deterrent to the environment. Printing and filling forms is a headache for employees and record keeping of such files is painstaking for employers. With a few clicks, the entire process of leave application till approval is completed when you have an employee leave management system at work. 2. Auto-update leave balance There is no point in buying an HR management software if HR staff has to compute and update leave data manually. With the right attendance management system like Truein, the entire process of tracking leave history and accessibility to the managers and employees is automated. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 3. Real-time information and updates When approving leaves or applying for leaves it is important to have information if it is the right time to approve or apply for a leave. Unless there is a leave management system that provides information in real-time, it is going to be difficult. Also, outdated information can result in conflicts between the managers and employees because it can cause rejection of applications of employees who need a vacation. Real-time updates are also important to avoid situations where too many permissions are granted resulting in understaffing. 4. Save the time of administration The benefits of a leave management system for administration are equally important. The total elimination of repetitive tasks makes leave management a lot faster and more convenient. Modern leave management systems can easily be integrated with other office tools. Such a level of automation saves a lot of time for administration and offers a more comprehensive ecosystem for employee management. 5. Transparent and accurate The online leave management system provides a comprehensive view of all leaves, either planned or unplanned in a single dashboard. For employers, it provides a tool to have accurate data on employees abusing leave policies or underusing their vacations. This transparency helps spot productivity leaks and tackle problems related to absenteeism. 6. Easily Manage Holidays An automated leave management system can help employers to manage the holiday and vacations of their employees more efficiently. With the help of the leave management system, your employees will be able to mark any leave of absence like holidays, sick leave , etc. Moreover, your employees will have access to their holiday leave at any moment.

June 25, 2024 A successful business is built on many pillars, but most important of all is a reliable workforce. If you can trust your employees with respecting the rules at the workplace, it becomes easier to focus on other aspects of business growth. However, time theft can be a real nuisance if not dealt with. According to several studies, time theft is one of the biggest reasons for the loss in business. A study estimates that most U.S. companies lose 20% of every dollar earned because of employee time theft . The most widely implemented scrutiny method to prevent employees from stealing business property is installing CCTV cameras on the premises. However, this doesn’t work when employees are doctoring timesheets or punching in for a colleague . You will be surprised to know that 30% of business failures are caused by some sort of employee theft or embezzlement. While one may argue that time theft is not the same as the removal of physical property, it nonetheless results in losses as it escalates labour costs and also wastes financial resources. If you are struggling with the same issue and want to put an end to employee time theft, it is recommended that you start by recognizing how time theft can take place. Table of Contents 4 Different Types of Time Theft 1. Buddy Punching 2. Extended Breaks 3. Time Clock Theft 4. Excessive personal time How to prevent time theft 1. Revise or Establish Time Theft Policies 2. Use tech to enhance accountability 3. Develop employee morale 4. Be realistic with expectations of your staff 5. Employ software to prevent employee time theft FAQs About Employee Time Theft Is employee time theft illegal? Is time theft common? 4 Different Types of Time Theft Simply put, time theft is when employees are not working for the hours they are paid for. Although, once in a while it is acceptable, if it is a regular practice, it amounts to time theft. According to a study, an average employee steals 4.5 hours a week from their employer , that’s a total of 6 work weeks every year. The most common ways in which employees do time theft are: 1. Buddy Punching Buddy punching is when an employee punches into the time clock for a colleague if they are running late or leave early. It is the easiest way to trick the attendance system into thinking that the employee worked for the full day. As per an American Payroll Association study, more than 75% of companies lose money due to the practice of buddy punching. 2. Extended Breaks Arguably, most innocent-looking time theft is when employees take too long breaks. While it is known that taking regular breaks keeps the productivity high in employees, but it must be closely monitored. Turning a 60-minute lunch break into a 75-minute break or extending 15-minute breaks by adding 5 minutes extra might not seem too drastic but when done consistently, the minutes add up pretty quickly. To avoid this issue you should implement a lunch break policy in your organization. For instance, smoke breaks have proved to be costly for companies. A study found that an average smoker takes roughly 6 days of smoke breaks a year, and this is only an average figure. For some industries, it adds up to 20 days a year. 3. Time Clock Theft Time clock theft is when an employee manipulates or lies about the time they work for. Often, employees do not do it with the wrong intention and round up their hours to make it easier for payroll to calculate the work hours, however a few minutes every day start to add up over weeks or a month. But some employees purposefully commit time theft. They can do it by simply asking their work buddy to clock in for them regularly. Others might intentionally not clock in and then lie about it later on. Another tricky practice is to clock in before they start working on the floor. Employees might enter the building, but they aren’t working when they should be. 4. Excessive personal time Working hours are more productive when employees do not feel bound or restrictive. This is why it is a positive perk to allow employees to take a personal call or reply to a personal email when emergencies happen. However, when an employee starts to abuse the system and consistently takes excessive personal time it moves into the time theft category. The most common instance of excessive personal time is when an employee runs their own business while at work. It can be anything, replying to customer emails or reaching out to them on social media platforms. How to prevent time theft Now that you are aware of how time theft is usually committed by employees and how disastrous it can be for your business, it is time to nip the evil in the bud. 1. Revise or Establish Time Theft Policies Do you have clear time theft policies in place? If you do, when was the last time you reviewed the policies? The time theft policies must be strategically framed such that your employees do not feel any unnecessary compulsion. Be aware of what you are asking of your employees. Make sure the policies are relevant and understandable. It is also important to adhere to employment standards in time theft policies. Time theft policies that are too restrictive will make your employees feel unfair and ultimately result in a low rate of compliance. Implementing time theft policies that are employee-friendly can make a huge difference in your company’s morale. 2. Use tech to enhance accountability Punch clocks and manual attendance registers are not going to make an impact and resolve the issue of time theft. You need to upgrade to more reliable attendance solutions like biometric systems. The fingerprint attendance system is the most commonly used biometric system that has replaced card swiping methods. However, in recent years, the pandemic has highlighted the need for systems that minimize human contact. Facial recognition attendance systems provide a solution to this issue. Attendance systems like Truein work on AI algorithms that allow employees to use their smartphones to clock in with face recognition. 3. Develop employee morale When you increase employee morale their engagement and productivity increase simultaneously. It also makes employees more loyal to the organization. Often employee productivity decreases when workers see other employees getting away with time theft. Implementing time theft policies and using advanced attendance systems will curb such getaways, but what about those who are honest with their work hours? Rewarding and recognizing such employees will encourage employee morale. Furthermore, you must try to create an environment of transparency, honesty, and trust. This will prevent time theft. 4. Be realistic with expectations of your staff There lies a big difference between encouraging your workers to boost productivity and overworking them. Ensure that you are setting up realistic goals to be achieved by employees including managers. If you set up unrealistic expectations that lead to break time getting cut or over time, your employees will start looking for ways to compensate for lost time. This is something you will not want. Be open about your expectations with your employees and communicate what is permitted during work hours and whatnot. 5. Employ software to prevent employee time theft No employee wants to manually put in work time or manage attendance sheets. You should work on making attendance systems less tedious. Smart attendance systems like Truein streamline the overall process and also reduce the cost incurred in hiring the human resource to manage attendance records. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account FAQs About Employee Time Theft Is employee time theft illegal?

How Biometric Attendance System Can Benefit Retail Stores? June 25, 2024 The retail industry is one of the most dynamic sectors employing a large number of people. From customer representatives to order fulfilment executives, retail stores require employees to be distributed over a large area. This requirement poses challenges such as attendance maintenance of all employees & several other compliance issues . Most retail brands have their store’s distributed over a large geographical network, employing a varying number of people. While the traditional attendance system like card punching machines offer a solution that is not efficient at protecting against problems like buddy punching . To overcome these challenges, the retail market is embracing modern-day biometric attendance systems . As these attendance systems allow for faster, secure and efficient business operations, they can benefit any retail store. If you still haven’t adopted a biometric attendance system for retail, you must have your questions and doubts about their effectiveness. In the ear of technological sophistication, you don’t have to settle for less efficient and legacy systems. This article is all about explaining the advantages of biometric attendance system for retail stores. Table of Contents Biometric Attendance System For Retail Industry Why your retail business needs a biometric attendance system? 1. Higher level of accuracy 2. Higher Productivity 3. Track Employees Easily 4. Manage flexible work schedules easily 5. Happy employees 6. Truein biometric attendance system can help Why use Truein Touchless Face Recognition Attendance System? 1. No additional hardware requirement 2. User-friendly interface 3. Cloud-based attendance system 4. GPS and Geo fencing attendance 5. Give different roles to different users 6. Flexibility to have different policies for different stores 7. Audit Punching Conclusion Biometric Attendance System For Retail Industry Biometric attendance systems have witnessed a huge demand from the retail industry for several reasons. From improving the accuracy of attendance management to boosting the productivity of employees, these systems are truly game-changers. At present, there are three main types of biometric attendance systems available for retail stores. Fingerprint Technology For Retail Industry : The fingerprint recognition system recognise the ridges and valleys (minutiae) on the surface of the finger to verify the identity of the person but sometimes it take multiple attempts to scan the fingerprint because of cuts and sweat on the fingers. Fingerprint recognition systems are useful and effective against time theft, but in the post-pandemic era, the focus is on minimising contact. As such these systems suffer a drawback. Eye Recognition Systems : As an alternative, the retail industry has the option to employ eye recognition systems for attendance marking. These systems have two modes of operation at the core. Some systems use iris recognition to identify an individual while others rely on retina recognition (they raise the patterns of veins in the back of the eye to identify an individual). Problem arises from their implementation as they require dedicated hardware installation and it is expensive as compared to other biometric attendance system. Face Recognition Systems : The best biometric attendance system for retail, a face recognition system eliminates the need for contact to mark attendance and it is more accurate than other type of biometric attendance system. Such attendance systems analyse the facial patterns by using Artificial Intelligence to identify an individual. Why your retail business needs a biometric attendance system? As a retail business owner or store manager, your time is best invested in mentoring and training your staff rather than wasting it juggling personnel to fit open shifts, keeping track of employee productivity and scheduling working shifts from scratch. By adopting a retail time and attendance software , you can free up a lot of time that can be invested in interacting with your customers and improving your business. With biometric attendance systems like the one offered by Truein, any outlet, wholesale or factory store can considerably reduce the time spent on scheduling and marking attendance. Such software can also drastically improve your workforce efficiency, reduce labour costs and optimise staff planning. This is not only beneficial for you as a business owner, but also benefit your employees to have a better work-life balance. 1. Higher level of accuracy Manually recording attendance and time leave scope for errors and inaccuracies. Even, employees are found to log their attendance timing wrong on purpose (time theft). The legacy attendance systems like card punching machines are also susceptible to such behaviour from employees. However, when you use a biometric attendance system you do away with such errors eliminating any possibility of time theft. Furthermore, such systems allow employees to monitor their own time, work schedules and appointments online via their smartphones or other devices. As the entire attendance system is cohesive, any schedule changes are updated live for all employees. 2. Higher Productivity Retail stores with a lesser number of employees can manage with less efficient attendance systems, but when you have a larger workforce, it can be a problem. At the end of the day, if employees have to manually enter time into the payroll software or you have to gather up time cards, it puts in an enormous amount of effort, not to mention a lot of time wasted. With a biometric attendance system, you can cut attendance marking and payroll processing tasks from hours down to minutes. As retail employees have a scheduling app, they do not have to wait for their turn to mark attendance. 3. Track Employees Easily Retail stores require employees to be scattered over a large place which makes it difficult to track employees. With biometric attendance systems, you can easily track field-based and remote employees when they clock in/out using systems or mobile devices with GPS tracking. As the software can track the GPS location of mobile devices, you do not have to invest in any additional hardware. You can put up geofencing to prevent time theft and mandate employees to be within a defined distance to be able to clock in. Furthermore, face recognition attendance systems use facial features to verify and record time, hence employees cannot game the attendance system through buddy punching. 4. Manage flexible work schedules easily A retail business has requirements beyond just storekeeping. There is logistics, inventory and security involved. This is why the retail industry employs part-time, full-time and contract employees . The clocking options vary depending on the type of employee. The modern-day attendance management software allows managers to deploy and monitor employees regardless of where they are working from or what type of schedule they are on. This deletes a lot of overhead and makes it infinitely easier to manage flexible work schedules and allot shifts to employees easily. 5. Happy employees A biometric attendance system not only benefits businesses but also helps employees to be paid accurately on time. All the human error that occurs when timesheets are filled out manually is eliminated. The attendance is logged accurately and updated in the system that makes payroll processing a lot easier. At the end of the day, it ultimately results in happy employees who are paid for their hard work without any delay. There are already several biometric attendance systems for retail stores available offered by different manufacturers, but Truein stands apart. 6. Truein biometric attendance system can help Truein offers the most advanced Touchless Face recognition Attendance system on the market.

An attendance system helps recognize which workers are arriving late and how much to pay them. The traditional method of taking attendance involves old-fashioned punch clocks, attendance sheets, or some other kind of manual system that require human supervision. However, electronic attendance systems are also known as e-attendance systems and they are completely autonomous and require no human oversight. Hardware-less attendance systems are the latest innovation in the industry that is also autonomous and doesn’t require any complicated hardware deployment at the site to mark attendance such as a mobile-based attendance system . In this article, we are about to compare electronic attendance with hardware-less attendance systems to determine which one is best suited for your business needs. Table of Contents What is an electronic attendance system? Types of electronic time and attendance system 1. Biometric attendance system 2. Time Card 3. Proximity Cards, Badges, and Key Fobs 4. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) 5. Web-based Login Stations Advantages of electronic attendance system 1. High Accuracy 2. Simplifies Payroll 3. Integration / Configuration 4. Security 5. Productivity / Efficiency Why pick electronic attendance systems over manual systems? Drawbacks of electronic systems compared to hardware-less attendance systems Do you need a hardware-less attendance system? Why choose the Truein attendance system What is an electronic attendance system? An electronic attendance system has electronic components that are managed by software to take attendance. These systems are popularly known as automated attendance systems as they require minimal human supervision to function. Depending on their operation, time and attendance systems can be of various types. Types of electronic time and attendance system 1. Biometric attendance system The most popular electronic attendance system is biometric. These systems are designed to identify unique physical traits of a person such as a fingerprint, handprint, retina, or face to record attendance. 2. Time Card A time card attendance system is comparatively less expensive than other electronic attendance solutions. Their operation is simple, each employee receives a time card that they swipe on the machine. Every time a card is swiped, the data is collected and automatically transferred to a timesheet, eliminating any manual paperwork. The major drawback of this electronic time attendance system is buddy punching . 3. Proximity Cards, Badges, and Key Fobs A more proficient upgrade to the time card system, these types of attendance systems work on geofencing or GPS technology. The employees only pass the proximity card, page, or key fob in front of the reader to mark the attendance. These systems can also be customized to track employee movements throughout the facility. 4. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) The IVR attendance system allows employees working in the field or at remote locations to clock in by calling in over a landline or cell phone. 5. Web-based Login Stations Most IT businesses where employees work from laptops or personal computers employ Web-based login stations. These systems set up a static IP address every time an employee logs into the computer. Advantages of electronic attendance system 1. High Accuracy The systems designed for electronic attendance are highly accurate. As these systems are entirely automated there is no scope for human error. On top of that, an electronic attendance system can keep track of any number of employees simultaneously, making the process highly efficient. 2. Simplifies Payroll Let’s face it, tracking employee hours, verifying and collating payroll is a laborious and time-consuming task. Thankfully, an electronic attendance machine can simplify this process by automating the entire workflow of attendance keeping and the payroll process. 3. Integration / Configuration An electronic attendance system can be customized to suit your needs based on the nature of work and policies. Most of these systems are designed to integrate with some of the most popular payroll software and services like Tally ERP and QuickBooks Intuit. 4. Security Most electronic attendance management systems are built for security. These systems have highly secure architecture, especially biometric systems. The organizations where security is a primary concern can trust electronic attendance systems. 5. Productivity / Efficiency Such attendance systems can free up precious administration time that is otherwise spent on keeping track of employees and managing the payroll system. The saved time and effort when combined with data accuracy improves productivity and hence the profits. Why pick electronic attendance systems over manual systems? An electronic attendance system is far superior to any manual system. These systems are much more accurate, require no human oversight, easily integrate with existing payroll software, and cannot be fooled easily. In a world where modern technologies are making it cost-effective to deploy smart business management solutions, if you are still stuck with a manual attendance system, you are losing revenue and may also be paying for the hours your employees never worked. That being said, there are some aspects where electronic systems lack. Drawbacks of electronic systems compared to hardware-less attendance systems An electronic time attendance system is not always a viable option. For instance, these systems have limited scope for businesses where employees are scattered over a large geographical area. Hardware-less systems are more reliable in such a scenario as workers can clock in using their mobile phones. Dependency on hardware sensors limits the efficiency of electronic systems in industries with a blue-collar workforce like mining and forging companies. Fingerprint systems are not as efficient here as workers’ fingers are often covered in dirt. For such a working environment, hardware-less systems like facial recognition are more efficient. Post pandemic work culture is shifting towards minimizing physical contact for the safety of employees, making hardware-less attendance systems more viable. Furthermore, electronic systems have higher maintenance cost due to hardware components. They also require more space for installation. Do you need a hardware-less attendance system? Yes, you do. Irrespective of what type of your business is, a hardware-less system is a worthwhile investment. It can perform all the functions an electronic attendance system can, but is far more cost-effective.

Employee Overtime Policy: How to Draft A Strategic and Encouraging Policy? May 20, 2024 Some of the world’s most successful companies have favorable employee policies. Among these rules, the overtime policy is a crucial aspect. Surprisingly, many employers are oblivious to employee rights and labor laws governing the overtime policy. Most common is the private sector, employees often work overtime past their working hours to achieve the company’s target and increase productivity. As a competitive corporate and business environment demands hard work from the workforce, companies must not overlook the need for a well-structured overtime policy. Table of Contents Understanding the overtime hours Why does your company need an overtime policy? How to draft an overtime policy? 1. Who are exempt employees are and who are non-exempt employees? 2. What are the essential working hours? 3. Whether overtime is optional, mandatory, or prohibited 4. What are the overtime limitations, if any? 5. Procedures to follow for working overtime 6. How much is the overtime pay? 7. How is overtime paid? 8. Disclaimer specific to the company, outside the applicable labor laws Accurate overtime tracking is a must Benefits of tracking overtime hours for employers Benefits of tracking overtime hours for employees Automate Overtime Tracking with Truein Bottomline Understanding the overtime hours Overtime is the period for which employees work after their regular working hours. In India , legally, an employee can be subject to 8-9 working hours a day, that’s 48-50 hours a week. As per the overtime policy in India, any employee working for more than the established working hours must receive the remuneration for the period worked beyond the mandatory working hours. Companies must have an overtime policy in place to set ground rules. Why does your company need an overtime policy? As part of employee-friendly work culture, companies must clearly define the overtime policy and procedure to help employees know whether working overtime is optional, mandatory, limited, or prohibited. It would help if you outlined the policies to address how you handle overtime hours. In India, the remuneration for overtime hours is 200% (twice the regular hourly rate), implying high costs. For full-time and contract workers, overtime policy differs. Usually, contract workers are not paid overtime. An overtime policy is essential to address how the company handles overtime hours for exempt and nonexempt employees. How to draft an overtime policy? Your employees must be aware of the overtime management policy at the company. It will provide them with all the essential reference points if they have any questions about the company’s overtime procedures or management policies. The overtime policy must clearly explain the employee overtime rules and procedures. There should be no ambiguity in the terms and conditions. Any comprehensive overtime policy must have the following information: 1. Who are exempt employees are and who are non-exempt employees? Exempt employees are those who do not receive overtime pay, nor do they qualify for minimum wage. Exempt primarily means employees who are exempt from receiving overtime pay. Nonexempt employees are entitled to receive federal minimum wage and qualify for overtime. 2. What are the essential working hours? In principle, essential working hours must not exceed 40 hours per week or eight hours per day , excluding breaks for US employees. As per the UAE Labour Law , private sector working hours are 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week and according to the Factories Act 1948 , in India employees cannot work for 48 hours a week or nine hours per day. The Indian state of Maharashtra has amended Section 65(2) of the Factories Act 1948 . Under this amendment seeking the state’s permission before giving overtime to workers is no longer compulsory. Furthermore, the management can extend overtime hours as they deem fit. 3. Whether overtime is optional, mandatory, or prohibited You can make overtime mandatory, optional, or ban it entirely, depending on your business. If your company has hectic weeks when the demand to deliver is high, you can set up weeks with mandatory overtime hours. Some businesses do not need employees working overtime, but they don’t ban it and make it optional. In some scenarios, overtime costs can be too high, prompting employers to prohibit it. 4. What are the overtime limitations, if any? Altogether banning employees from working overtime can be counterproductive. To reduce cost, you can put limitations. For example, you can specify how many hours an employee can work overtime a week. It will help you control the cost. 5. Procedures to follow for working overtime Do employees need permission to work overtime? If so, how can they request to work overtime? How can employees report overtime? These are some examples of procedures to include in your overtime policy draft. 6. How much is the overtime pay? While overtime pay is generally 1.5-2x times an employee’s normal salary per hour, you can also choose to reward salaried employees working extra hours with additional perks. 7. How is overtime paid? Will the overtime pay be included in regular wages, or will the company run a separate payroll for overtime hours? It must be answered in the policy. 8. Disclaimer specific to the company, outside the applicable labor laws Depending on the type of industry, companies can have specific disclaimers on how they handle events during overtime hours like food privileges, traveling allowance, etc. These are the general guidelines to help you draft an overtime policy for a company. A viable employee overtime policy must include all the elements listed above and applicable rules and procedures depending on the industry and the local law. Accurate overtime tracking is a must Tracking overtime hours is not only a legal requirement, but it also makes your company a better place to work. When you are tracking over time, you can better manage team resources and adjust workloads to ensure the well-being of the employees. For companies, accurate overtime tracking is the only way to compensate employees for their overtime hours. As employees and employers have rights and entitlements in the context of overtime policy and procedure, accurately tracking overtime is in the interests of both. Before the pandemic struck, an average employee worked a little over four hours of overtime , and 59% of the distributed workforce worked overtime at least a week. As the crisis unfolded, these numbers increased substantially. Recent research found that one in four public healthcare managers worked more than 20 hours overtime during the pandemic crisis. Benefits of tracking overtime hours for employers These numbers indicate that keeping track of overtime hours is more important than ever. Tracking overtime hours is mandatory for companies to ensure compliance with labor laws. Furthermore, it lets companies keep track of one of the most significant ongoing expenses. Employers must commit to maintaining overtime visible and accountable to provide compensation accordingly. For HR, tracking helps with effective resource management. Managers can better review company-wide work patterns and improvise to split work effectively between employees. It has tremendous value for the employer brand as it can prevent employee burnout, disengagement, and unhealthy workplace culture. Benefits of tracking overtime hours for employees Accurate overtime tracking ensures proper compensation. It is effective in protecting against wage theft. Furthermore, employees get paid faster as time tracking updates the payroll department about the number of overtime hours in real-time. It helps employees fight unsustainable and unfair working practices. With overtime tracking, employees become more aware of their weekly capacity. It helps them make more intelligent and more efficient decisions about using their time.

Ease of Use HR in the Future Why Attendance Management Matters An attendance management system is software that helps track, monitor, and manage company attendance. For companies dealing with Contractual or distributed workforce, attendance management directly helps boost workforce productivity and plug attendance related leakages if any. An attendance management tool can help an HR professional or business owner do any of the following: Manage team clock in and clock out Track leaves and absences Automate shift scheduling Payroll integration Analytics and reporting Attendance compliance automation Boost workforce productivity And so many more So why would a company need an attendance management system for their team? Here are a few of the most convincing benefits of having an attendance management system for your team. 5 Benefits of Attendance Management System 1. More efficiency Having an attendance management system is efficient for both your team and your managers. Countless HR managers spend several hours a week manually creating shift rosters , tracking absences and leaves, and managing worker attendance. With attendance management solutions, you can automate and streamline activities like shift scheduling , absence tracking, and many more. Efficiency also improves for your employees as it will now become easier to apply for leaves, track their schedules, and report any attendance issues. This works for both online and offline teams as cloud-based software can also be geotagged so that team members can only clock in when they’re in the vicinity of their office or place of work. 2. Less effort With more efficiency comes lesser effort to maintain and comply with attendance management protocols. Imagine this scenario— HR people had to manually check Bundy clock punch in cards daily and then manually compute salaries. Now, with an online employee attendance app , people can clock in on the cloud, and then managers can access analytics dashboards that summarize work hours and absences so admins will have an easier time calculating salaries. Many attendance management applications integrate seamlessly with payroll software so HR departments can spend less time calculating salaries and more time disbursing them promptly. This use-case is one of the many ways team attendance tracking software helps teams. It can also lessen the effort spent creating attendance reports for evaluations, shift scheduling, leave tracking, and many other aspects of attendance monitoring. 3. More results Now that HR managers and business owners spend less time on administrative tasks related to attendance management, they can spend more time on high-level tasks that bring more results, like networking, product development, employee engagement activities, marketing, and so on. We’re coming into a time when work culture will matter more than ever before. Human resource managers will have to spend more time and energy creating ways to build a strong work culture. Reserving their time for that can now be possible if they automate other parts of their HR tasks like attendance management so they can drive needed results for the team as a whole. 4. Happier staff Higher workplace engagement brings about up to 41% less incidences of absenteeism and up to 21% more profit. So focusing on happiness in the workplace doesn’t just benefit the staff. It also benefits the company. Attendance management software can also have a direct impact on employee happiness. For one, leaves will be honored faster given that these tools automate many of the notification and approval tasks involved in leave management. When there is a single unified system, it is easy to manage massive records and there is no need for manual reconciliations. 5. Healthier staff Companies should also start viewing employee engagement as a goal and not just a means to more profit too. So healthy staff is a great goal or benefit to achieve with attendance management. Overwork is one of the leading causes of workplace burnout, a phenomenon that costs the U.S. industry alone over $300 billion annually. Businesses and managers have a responsibility of protecting their staff members’ workplace health, in both physiological and psychological terms. Attendance management is a part of that process—checking who among staff members are overworked and addressing accordingly by lessening their workload or giving them time off. 3 Considerations When Choosing A Time & Attendance Management System​ Having an online attendance management system can bring all kinds of benefits to your team. So how does one select and set up an HR software for attendance management? Here are some considerations you should have when choosing the best leave management system for your team or company. 1. Automation The first consideration to keep in mind with your time and attendance management system is the available automation it provides. You want something that has the most automation available. The goal of a software solution is to make your or your team’s lives easier. Automations can do that by removing manual tasks and setting up alerts and notifications so you and your team can take your mind off the repetitive parts of human resource management and focus more on things like: Coaching Employee evaluations Team building Team development Hiring and recruitment 2. Features The next thing you need to look out for is the features that are necessary for your context. Not all systems are built equally, and not all companies need the same kinds of features. Each HR software solution is unique and has other selling points. So you want to be sure that you’re doing all the research necessary to find out which solution fits your context best. Make a list of tasks you want to automate in attendance management systems, turn it into a checklist, and start looking for solutions that provide those features. Here’s a list of features of HR software that you can check out to build that list. Also, consider what kind of team setup you have. If you have an onsite team, for example, then you might need a biometric attendance management system. 3. Ease of Use The last consideration in choosing your attendance management system is the ease of use. Is the software easy for your managers to access and use? Moreover, is it easier for the rest of the team to use? Select a system that has a user experience that fits your team best. For teams with lesser tech-savvy members, you might want to choose an app that’s straightforward and has lesser functions. Every team will have its own set of preferences. You can also choose a solution that allows for more white labeling so that the software will match more with the company’s identity and give users a higher sense of ownership. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account HR in the Future Human resource management is undoubtedly changing.

The traditional 9 to 5 hours for companies with global customers are not sustainable anymore. To offer round-the-clock service, companies need to employ shift management. Shift rostering is becoming popular among employees as it allows them to work outside the conventional 9-5 schedule. Shifts are crucial for prompt customer care, continuous business operations, and avoiding any service gaps. In this article, we will explore shift management and its benefits. Table of Contents What is shift rostering? Importance of shift rostering for a company 1. Well-managed shifts allow employee flexibility 2. Increase productivity and company growth 3. Help reduce labor costs by saving overtime Why manual shift rostering is a problem? How to optimize shift management effectively 1. Plan shift requirements in advance 2. Use automated tools to manage shifts 3. Plan the schedule in the software or tool 4. Track employees 5. Detailed report of the roster Truein for ultimate shift management Some features that make Truein stand out: Conclusion What is shift rostering? A shift roster also known as shift management is a schedule that determines the hours of work or ‘shift’ that employees should work for in a company. It typically includes a list of employees and information regarding their schedules, such as the timing, location, and responsibilities. Most companies use shift management to ensure that each shift has an adequate number of employees. It is necessary to ensure that the productivity remains the same and the work distribution is even. W hen there is a larger workforce or multiple shifts, problems can often occur, and shift management helps spot the issues. Importance of shift rostering for a company Employers can use shift management to get high productivity from employees in each shift. If you are not already using shift rostering to manage workers’ schedules, you miss several benefits of shift management. 1. Well-managed shifts allow employee flexibility Employees value flexibility, and ever since the pandemic struck, employees have wanted flexibility more than any other thing in a job. According to a survey, 63% of employees want more flexibility in their careers . Work shifts allow employees to manage their time better. Employees with childcare responsibilities want early shifts, while university students might wish to go for evening shifts. Well-managed shifts let employees manage their time well, reducing the attrition rate. 2. Increase productivity and company growth When employees work in shifts, they are not over-worked or burdened with tasks due to uneven work distribution. It makes them more productive and prevents employee burnout. Also, companies can use shifts to stay open for longer and be well-staffed to increase output and revenues. It leads to company growth. 3. Help reduce labor costs by saving overtime Overtime is a significant cost for businesses. Most companies report that the overtime budget comprises 10% to 15% of their annual budget . With effective shift planning, companies can tailor the staff number as per their need in shifts. For example, a company can divide a workforce of 60 into three shift rosters of 20 employees. Then the shift hours can accommodate peak hours and ensure that the maximum number of employees are available at these hours. Such a shift management system will help reduce labor costs without compromising efficiency and productivity. Shift management is essential, but most managers think shift rostering is about letting staff know the number of hours they need to work. It is this thought process that prompts them to do shift rostering manually. Unfortunately, manual shift rostering can be highly challenging. Why manual shift rostering is a problem? According to a study, most companies with manual shift management spend 19,741 person-hours every year on it. Manual shift management relies on human intervention. Every change and following updates in the roster are done manually. It is challenging to plan the roster every time there is a change as it is highly time-consuming. Furthermore, when no automated system exists, HR managers cannot keep track of who is working and who’s not in real-time. It also makes it challenging to manage shifts, and check the absentees manually. Manual shift management is rigid; any shift change will require hours to rearrange the entire roster. It also makes frequent shift swapping tedious. Also, with no central data storage or tools to extract the data, HR will depend on worksheets to make resource management decisions. It is time-consuming and leads to frequent errors in shift management. How to optimize shift management effectively As manual shift management is not sustainable, companies need automated solutions to optimize and improve shift rostering. Here are some benefits of such optimization: 1. Plan shift requirements in advance Effective shift management is about timing. To reduce the number of absentees and absence requests, you must provide them with the work schedule ahead of time. When you plan things like the number of shifts, no. of employees in each shift, and the work, you allow enough time for employees to prepare for their shift. This flexibility is essential to give plenty of room and avoid last-minute scrambling. Managers must focus on shift planning to reduce the overall stress and tension associated with last-minute schedules. It does not have a positive impact on employees. 2. Use automated tools to manage shifts Digital transformation of businesses is essential, and so, when companies embrace technology, they become adaptable and future-proof. For schedule management optimization, companies can use scheduling software solutions like Truein . Today, flexible and user-friendly automated tools are available that HR managers can use to manage shifts. Paper tables and spreadsheets are outdated; automated tools help companies optimize their shift planning and reduce costs and workforce overheads. 3. Plan the schedule in the software or tool Manual shift planning adds much overhead for both employees and managers. For instance, if an employee requests a shift change, he will put a request manually in the absence of software or tool. Then the manager has to review and approve the request manually. But somewhere along the way, the request can be forgotten or miscommunicated. A tool or software can make the entire scheduling process quick and effective. 4. Track employees Managers can quickly identify absentee replacements, track employees in real-time, and handle shift swaps and approvals when the company has software for shift management. For instance, Truein has options to optimize resource allocation by tracking employees. It allows planned work distribution among available employees in a shift. 5. Detailed report of the roster Most shift rostering software provides reporting features. From a central dashboard, managers can view and generate reports like the number of shifts, employees, detail of employees, etc. These detailed reports help optimize company resources and boost productivity.

Managers at a company perform several tasks and activities, but one of the most tedious is time and attendance management. Many organizations still rely on manual mechanisms to record time and attendance without realizing the cost and redundancy such systems incur. Manual attendance recording leads to many challenges. Manual time entry is time-consuming, but it is also ineffective and outdated. There is always a risk of human error, and employees can commit time theft easily. Automated time and attendance systems help organizations improve the accuracy and efficacy of recordings. Table of Contents What is an automated time and attendance system? 8 Benefits of automated time and attendance system 1. Improves productivity 2. Dependable accuracy 3. It saves time and money 4. HR can better handle shift management 5. Improve employee satisfaction by preventing payroll errors 6. Designed for the contractual and distributed workforce 7. Better security than manual systems 8. Easier to manage as compared to a manual attendance system How can Truein help you with automating the time and attendance system? What is an automated time and attendance system? An automated time and attendance system is a cloud-based or local-server-based app and web system that organizations use to record attendance. Automated attendance systems are of several kinds, such as biometric attendance systems, punching systems, and face recognition attendance systems . Let’s look at the benefits of automated time and attendance systems. 8 Benefits of automated time and attendance system 1. Improves productivity Managers have to spend long, tedious hours keeping track of employees from when they check in till their shift gets over. It is a waste of time for them, and so by using an automated attendance system, they can utilize their time on strategies to improve productivity. Such a system helps track, monitor, and update employee details on the payroll. In the absence of an automated time and attendance system, monitoring and recording time becomes a full-time job. When managers are free from this repetitive administrative task, they can focus on formulating business strategies and improving decision-making. It brings efficiency and productivity into the teams and increases profits. 2. Dependable accuracy Fewer errors and improved accuracy are essential benefits of automated time and attendance systems. According to a survey by Axsium Group, companies lose around $1,600 per employee every year due to human error in attendance management. Manual attendance systems can contribute to financial losses. Cloud-based automated attendance systems like Truein can collect employee data in real-time accurately. Such time and attendance systems also provide all-in-one scheduling and overtime management services. Also, the dependable accuracy of attendance apps ensures no over or under-payments. All employees are paid accurately for the hours they work. 3. It saves time and money Automated attendance systems save time and improve productivity but also help keep costs. When managers have accurate data on overtime, leaves, and shifts, you pay employees for the hours that they have worked, not extra. Automated systems prevent time theft that additionally saves money. Apart from these direct cost savings, automated attendance systems help find issues in shift management to improve productivity that boosts revenue. With automatic time and attendance recording, you save money in the short and long run. 4. HR can better handle shift management Shift rostering is essential to maintain a 24/7 work schedule without causing employee burnout. Automated time and attendance systems allow scheduling, and managers can plan shifts based on analytics and reports to ensure there are no gaps in the availability of the employees. Tracking the employees in real-time helps distribute work at peak hours more efficiently. It is also possible to notify employees about shift changes as soon as there is any change. It allows employees to plan their timing and prevents absences. 5. Improve employee satisfaction by preventing payroll errors Compensation is a big motivator for employees. Any payroll error can lead to dissatisfaction among employees. For instance, it can be highly demotivating if the employees work overtime to help the company meet its production goals but do not get the money for hours outside the shifts. Automated attendance systems help prevent such inaccuracies in payroll. Automatic time and attendance recording allow employers and employees to keep track of how many hours an employee is working, eliminating any scope for miscommunication or errors. Systems like Truein integrate with some of the most popular payroll software allowing companies to maintain a high level of employee satisfaction. 6. Designed for the contractual and distributed workforce Companies with distributed teams and contractual workers can significantly benefit from the automated time and attendance systems. These systems allow segregation of employees based on the type of employment. Managers can include distributed and contractual workers’ policies within the system to let them know of overtime and payroll terms. 7. Better security than manual systems Automated time and attendance systems contribute to the overall security of the workplace. You can integrate most of these systems seamlessly into existing payroll solutions. They aid identity time theft and other kinds of employee fraud. Such systems allow tracking of employees in real-time, enabling the deployment of security measures to prevent any suspicious activities. Automated attendance systems use encryption to store all the employee data. This security feature prevents identity theft and helps protect both employees and customers. Employee identity compromise also puts customers at risk as cybercriminals can use the stolen identity to reach customers as employees and scam them. 8. Easier to manage as compared to a manual attendance system Automated attendance systems are usually cloud-based, making them decentralized on the operation level however at the same time centralized for admin control and real-time view. It makes them lightweight to deploy. Installation is possible with a few clicks, and employees do not have to do a lot to mark attendance. Manual attendance systems require full-time attention to record time and attendance. Furthermore, there is no way to import or export data, making it more difficult to make payroll decisions. Any company not embracing modern attendance solutions risks its profits and productivity in the digital era. Companies can free their managers from repetitive administrative tasks with automated time and attendance systems. It will allow human minds to focus on more critical tasks like strategy and positioning rather than recordkeeping. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account How can Truein help you with automating the time and attendance system?

Attendance Regularization: What It Is and Why Is It Essential For Your Organization? June 25, 2024 Attendance management is among the prime duties of the HR department. Automated attendance management applications like Truein can make it easier to record attendance. Automating attendance recording and payroll management is not the only benefit of adopting such systems. Attendance regularization is another crucial advantage that automated attendance systems offer. Let’s understand why there is a requirement to regularize attendance and how vital attendance regularization is for any organization. Table of Contents What is attendance regularization? Should leaves and missed punches not marked be regularized? How can Truein help to regularize attendance? Attendance Regularization Email Template For HR Managers Apply and approve regularization requests from Truein User App Manually regularize employee attendance Conclusion What is attendance regularization? Attendance Regularization is a feature in the time and attendance management system that enables employees to correct the ‘in’ and ‘out’ time. This is an important feature required to introduce flexibility in the workplace. Suppose your company uses a biometric system for attendance recording. If an employee has to leave for some fieldwork or attend a meeting with the client, in the absence of any option, the attendance system will mark them on leave. Their inability to mark attendance will wrongfully lead to a pay cut. To overcome the issue, employees will have to contact the HR team to inform them about their situation, who will correct the attendance. The whole process is tedious. A better way is to provide an attendance regularization option to the employees to correct their work hours if required. Attendance regularization is also “Work from home” friendly. When working from home, employees have to step out of work from time to time to attend to their kids, pets, or some other responsibilities. In such a scenario, they have to clock out and later clock in to complete their work shift. But as they have not worked continuously, they have to regularize their attendance to make sure they get paid for their hours. Should leaves and missed punches not marked be regularized? Organizations should have a policy stating that employees should apply for regularization before the end of the month. If they are not regularized, you should have an appropriate rule policy that states application will not be accepted or one that results in disciplinary action. This is essential to ensure that all leaves and attendance punches are accurately recorded and marked on time to avoid any potential issues or misunderstandings between employer and employee. How can Truein help to regularize attendance? Truein is an AI-based face recognition attendance system that makes attendance regularization a simple task. Companies can record all attendance and leave related activities into a cloud database through Truein’s user app or web interface. This attendance system allows both employees and HR managers to initiate and complete attendance regularization. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Attendance Regularization Email Template For HR Managers You can use the below email template to give feedback to an employee attendance regularization request.

According to Statista , post-COVID-19, the adoption of touchless interfaces such as facial recognition, touchless apps, etc., is on the rise. In India, 82% of people expected touchless interactions at the workplace or with other organizations during the pandemic, and 48% of them still want touchless technologies at work now. As more and more organizations use touchless sensing devices like a smart attendance system using face recognition, the touchless solutions industry is growing at 17.4%. It would touch $15.3 billion in 2025, more than doubling from $6.8 billion in 2020 . Table of Contents Why touch-based biometric attendance systems are a hazard? Rise of touchless IoT based smart attendance systems Here are some examples: Benefits of smart attendance system 1. Attendance tracking in real-time 2. Fewer errors because of minimum human intervention 3. Cost-saving because of lesser payroll error 4. Ideal for the contractual and distributed workforce 5. More secure than a manual attendance system 6. Small to big data- all can be managed easily 7. Automatic report generation for employees' working hours How can Truein help your organization with a smart attendance system? Conclusion Why touch-based biometric attendance systems are a hazard? Touch-based biometric systems’ dependency on human contact to function makes them a source of infection. Attendance systems that use attributes like fingerprint recognition , hand geometry recognition, or typing recognition require physical touch. The surfaces of these systems accumulate germs, bacteria, and viruses with each touch and, at the same time, distribute them. In the wake of the risk posed by touch-based biometric attendance systems, the Government of Delhi advised suspension of biometric attendance systems in March 2020 . Physical risks and the touch-based attendance system also stress out employees. Because of the coronavirus scare, employees at the Maharishi Valmiki Hospital in Delhi reported “psychological unease” when using biometric systems. As a result, the hospital suspended the use of these systems as a precautionary measure. Rise of touchless IoT based smart attendance systems Touch-based biometric systems offer an enhanced way to deal with time theft and buddy punching , but relying on hardware sensors that require physical contact makes them less sensitive in case fingers are smudged in oil or grease, or if workers are wearing hand gear. Post pandemic businesses have to adjust the existing infrastructure to minimize the need for contact. Solution providers utilized IoT or Internet of Things technologies to fill this requirement gap to offer touchless attendance systems. Many companies adopt IoT-based facial recognition attendance systems to automate logging and boost productivity. Here are some examples: Tata 1mg adopted Truein to automate attendance logging across their 14 facilities within a couple of days. The company is using Truein to record the attendance of their 2000 employees in real-time across geographical locations. Godrej Lawkim Motors is another brand using Truein to automate attendance logging and employee tracking in real-time . The company uses Truein to keep track of its 700+ employees with geofencing and GPS technologies. The far-reaching benefits make smart attendance systems a requirement rather than a choice in the post-pandemic landscape. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Benefits of smart attendance system An efficient smart attendance management system can help companies improve their organizational ethics and work culture. The benefits go beyond attendance logging. The main benefits include: 1. Attendance tracking in real-time Most modern touchless attendance systems are cloud-based. These systems log data in real-time. They can be used on mobile devices and personal computers; they help track employees for efficient management. Automatic attendance systems can provide direct payroll processing input to improve productivity further. All the information is available in real-time, making it easier to schedule shifts, delegate tasks, and manage absentees. Manufacturing industries can use these systems to track employees scattered over a large area without additional hardware. Attendance systems like Truein work on smartphones seamlessly. 2. Fewer errors because of minimum human intervention Manual attendance systems have a high error rate. As these systems entirely depend on human input, there are many issues. Sometimes employees can forget to log in their arrival time, and at other times, they willfully abuse the system by logging extended periods. With automated attendance systems, companies eliminate all these issues. These systems function without human intervention; they record data with high accuracy. Companies can rely on their data to analyze workforce behavior and make critical management decisions. Touchless face recognition attendance systems like Truein collect and log data in real-time. Therefore, there is no scope for employees to meddle with the system. 3. Cost-saving because of lesser payroll error Manual attendance systems are inaccurate due to human errors. Introducing highly accurate attendance systems saves companies much money lost through payroll frauds and mistakes. In the United States, businesses lose over one billion dollars every year due to time theft . A smart attendance system using face recognition can not only eliminate time theft but can also increase the productivity of the HR department by automating a large part of payroll management. By adopting a smart attendance system, your organization can save up to $1600 per employee each year. 4. Ideal for the contractual and distributed workforce Companies with distributed workforce require attendance systems customized for different time zones and locations. Smart attendance systems allow this customization feature to accommodate different time zones. You can also set various policies and payroll rules for employees based on their physical location. It makes it a lot easier to manage a distributed workforce. 5. More secure than a manual attendance system Most IoT-based smart attendance systems have highly secured architecture. As the primary goal of these systems is to log accurate timing, they thwart any attempts of time theft, such as buddy punching, reporting extra hours, and longer lunch breaks. Biometric systems use unique individual physical traits that cannot be transferred or copied. Organizations where security is a primary concern use smart attendance systems. 6. Small to big data- all can be managed easily As mentioned before, smart attendance systems use cloud-based infrastructure. One of the benefits of using the cloud is scalability. Companies can use these systems to store data of 10 or 10,000 employees with the same ease. Cloud infrastructure extends as the requirement for data storage increases. Once you deploy a face recognition-based smart attendance system like Truein, you will never have to worry about upgrades to accommodate more employee data. 7. Automatic report generation for employees' working hours A smart attendance system is cloud-based; it stores data in decentralized databases that can be accessed anywhere. The HR managers no longer need to go through tedious data sorting and manual timesheet retrieval to calculate salaries or overtime. Smart attendance systems provide analytical report generation tools. It drastically saves the time and effort required to create business insights to optimize the workforce and productivity within an organization. How can Truein help your organization with a smart attendance system? Truein is a touchless face recognition attendance system that uses IoT technology and AI algorithms to offer a centralized and foolproof attendance system.

The use of biometric login for devices like mobiles, tablets, and even laptops is standard now. However, in the post-pandemic era, where the focus is on limiting physical contact, the same fingerprint recognition technology can prove to be obstructive. Many firms relied on fingerprint attendance systems to manage their workforce as they offered better security and automation. But, when COVID-19 struck, the same fast and non-invasive attendance systems became hotspots for spreading the infection. In the wake of the seriousness of the situation, state and local governments in India suspended the use of fingerprint biometric attendance systems . According to a Mint Report , a leading Indian telecom operator replaced 650 fingerprint-based attendance systems with facial recognition systems across India. A large steel-producing company embraced the exact change. These are some instances that bring forth the disadvantages of fingerprint biometrics. The limitations of fingerprint attendance system are not limited to just the fear of touch that affects employees’ mental and emotional states. In this article, we explore these disadvantages in detail. Table of Contents The drawbacks of depending on fingerprint attendance systems 1. Issues with recognition of damaged fingerprints 2. Deployment can be expensive 3. Fingerprint data can get stolen 4. Not ideal for remote and field workers 5. Accuracy is not as high as facial recognition systems 6. Less efficient than facial recognition system 7. Rate of error 8. Environmental challenges Why are face recognition attendance systems a better alternative to fingerprint systems? Truein: The Ultimate Face Recognition Attendance System The drawbacks of depending on fingerprint attendance systems 1. Issues with recognition of damaged fingerprints There is a lack of flexibility to identify the person in case of a cut or wound or when fingerprints are smudged with dirt or grease. Fingerprint sensors are sensitive, which works in their favor if the fingers are clean, but these sensors are inefficient for industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing. The workforce in these industries either wears safety gear like gloves or has dirt and dust on their fingers. It makes it cumbersome for them to record their attendance. 2. Deployment can be expensive Fingerprint attendance systems are entirely dependent on hardware and peripherals. It is often expensive to scale these systems as you will need to install hardware at every location. There is no alternative to investing in new hardware every time. For companies that have a primarily distributed workforce, with employees working on remote sites or massive production floors, disadvantages of biometric scanning become evident. 3. Fingerprint data can get stolen Fingerprint attendance systems often store data about physical traits such as fingerprint and palm veins in a local database. This information is linked with individual workers. It is essential to keep the data protected at times. Companies enabling fingerprint attendance systems have to deploy measures to prevent the data from being hacked or stolen. 4. Not ideal for remote and field workers Dependence on standalone machines is one of the significant disadvantages of fingerprint identification. Such attendance systems require dedicated hardware to record attendance. Companies cannot deploy standalone kiosks at fields or remote locations. 5. Accuracy is not as high as facial recognition systems Fingerprint attendance systems are not as accurate as facial recognition systems. Also, workers utilize tools and heavy machinery leading to wearing fingerprints for labor-intensive industries such as mining. It makes it difficult for machines to recognize the fingerprints leading to frustration. Workers have to fill out attendance sheets manually. Facial recognition systems are highly accurate as they do not depend on just set biometric attributes like fingerprints. Such systems use algorithms like Eigenfaces , Fisherfaces , and Kernel Methods that are highly accurate. These systems can recognize an individual even with changing facial features like beard, glasses, or mask. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 6. Less efficient than facial recognition system Fingerprint attendance systems are not as versatile or fast as face recognition attendance systems. Systems like Truein easily integrate with HRMS/Payroll software, increasing the productivity of the HR team. Fingerprint attendance systems are highly dependent on hardware, making them prone to performance issues. Hardware components get heated with heavy usage, which decreases their efficiency. 7. Rate of error Biometric attendance machines that use fingerprints are prone to two errors: False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). When the system accepts an unauthorized person, it is a FAR error, while FRR occurs when the system rejects an authorized person. In studies, the total error rate of biometric systems is around 1% , implying that for an organization with 1000 employees, an error will occur for 100 employees when recording the attendance. 8. Environmental challenges Fingerprint attendance systems have high error rates under extreme cold or heat. As they depend on hardware, deploying them to locations where the climate is harsh or changes rapidly poses a challenge. Because of all these disadvantages of fingerprint recognition, companies are switching to face recognition systems. Why are face recognition attendance systems a better alternative to fingerprint systems? Adopting a face recognition attendance system can eliminate all the above-listed disadvantages of the fingerprint attendance system. Face recognition attendance systems like Truein work on AI-enabled algorithms that do not depend on physical touch to identify a worker, offering touchless safety. These systems have almost 100% accuracy and work with facial hair, changes in facial features, aging, masks, etc. Additionally, these systems do not depend on custom hardware to record attendance. Workers can download supporting apps on their smartphones to mark attendance. It is advantageous for companies with workers at remote sites or fieldwork.

Attendance Policy: What It Is and How To Create It For Your Organization? June 25, 2024 Every company needs an adequate time and attendance policy to inform employees about the expectations of the organization and the consequences of failing to meet them. Employee attendance is a critical factor in the overall performance of an organization, and if not kept under check, it can lead to significant problems. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) , productivity losses resulting from employee absenteeism cost employers $225.8 billion annually, or $1,685 per employee. When your workers are aware of the attendance policy in place, it helps boost the productivity of your business. HR managers must remember that unexpected absence once in a while is alright, but regular absenteeism can severely impact the bottom line. Even if your company does not have an attendance problem, an effective attendance policy can help keep things organized. It communicates the attendance requirements to the employees. Here in this guide, we will explore the attendance policy in detail. Let’s start with the basics. Table of Contents What is an attendance policy? Why does an organization need an attendance policy? 1. HR Management 2. Cost Control 3. Maintaining Transparency How to write an effective attendance policy? 1. Don't use ambiguous definitions 2. Create employee protocols 3. Don't publish a policy draft without collaborating with employees 4. Enact the policy Attendance policy template How to track employee time and attendance? 1. Identify the tracking needs of your business 2. Choose the right time and attendance system Conclusion What is an attendance policy? An employee attendance policy is a document that defines the set of rules to reduce absenteeism, improve employee productivity and clearly explain expectations for employees in a consistent language. An employee attendance policy indicates the time to arrive and leave throughout the defined workweek. Furthermore, it clearly explains the violations such as arriving late, leaving early and being absent. It should also contain information on how employees should report their arrival and departure. The policy should help employees distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable absences. A comprehensive attendance policy also provides the logic and reason behind the creation and enforcement of the policy. Why does an organization need an attendance policy? As mentioned above, an attendance policy is essential to establish professional expectations from your staff. Still, most importantly, it provides a formal structure for reprimanding repeated non-compliance to the guidelines. Here are other benefits of implementing a well-defined attendance policy in your organization. 1. HR Management When there is an attendance policy to instruct employees, it becomes easier to allocate your human resources, such as employees, efficiently. For instance, a policy can include specific instructions for the workforce to report on the floor 10 minutes before a shift change to ensure that the assembly line runs smoothly. You can also have a specific notice period before taking a leave to allow enough time for HR managers to bring in replacement staff. An attendance policy can help efficiently use the workforce and distribute workloads to keep the operations up unabated. 2. Cost Control Employee absenteeism or lateness cost companies revenue which is why it is essential to keep a check on it. For example, suppose a staffer who is expected to open the business at a particular time is regularly late; it can tarnish the reputation of your business and make customers think of it as unreliable. With a strict attendance policy, you can modify such behavior and address it immediately to resolve the issue from becoming a problem. 3. Maintaining Transparency When the managers do not handle employees who are not punctual and take too many off, it demoralizes other staffers who come to work on time. It is also unfair to other employees to cover for regularly late staffers. With an attendance policy, you can prevent repeated absenteeism, eradicating any instance of infighting between staffers. By implementing an attendance policy, you send a message that you don’t take frequent absenteeism lightly and always take a formal approach to deal with the attendance issues. How to write an effective attendance policy? A good attendance policy takes an organization’s culture and needs into consideration. Depending on the industry, the requirements of your employees can differ and soak in the business environment. While every business has its unique requirements, here are some tips for creating an attendance policy for employees that is comprehensive and effective. 1. Don't use ambiguous definitions It is essential to have clear and concise definitions in an attendance policy so that employees can understand the requirements. Avoid using ambiguous terminologies at all costs. Clearly define tardiness, accused absence, unexcused absence, sick leave , paid time off , and half-day. For instance, when you describe tardiness, explicitly inform employees how much late they can clock in, like recording the attendance of more than 10 minutes late will be tardiness. 2. Create employee protocols There should be a clear protocol for all the workers when requesting leaves, time off, or going to be late. The attendance policy should fairly outline how an employee should alert managers and what actions will be taken if an employee does not show up without advance notice. 3. Don't publish a policy draft without collaborating with employees Once the first draft of the attendance policy with all crucial definitions and protocols outlined is ready, it is time to explore all possible scenarios. Add multiple sections and distinctions for workers and managers wherever necessary. The policy must include medical emergencies, climatic obstructions, and other unforeseen circumstances. The idea here is to create a fair attendance policy that managers should not use as a weapon against the employees; instead, it should protect their interests. To achieve this goal, you may want to share the draft with employees and seek their feedback within a limited time. Set up open discussions with employees to address any concerns or requests. It is essential to ensure that the attendance policy does not alienate employees. 4. Enact the policy After workers have reviewed the attendance policy draft, the final step is to enact a plan. You must ensure that both existing and new workers have access to the policy. It is also essential to train the HR managers to enforce the policy consistently and fairly for all employees if there are violations. These are the basic steps to writing an attendance policy, and we have provided them as a general guideline. To guide you further, here is a sample attendance policy. Attendance policy template Add a logo of the company here Introduction to Employee Attendance Policy: At [NAME OF BUSINESS] , good workplace attendance is one of the primary expectations from all employees. We expect every employee to take full responsibility for their attendance without compromising on the company’s policies. All employees are expected to arrive on time, be present, and work for the entire duration of all scheduled shifts. Any requirement for leaving work early, absences, and late arrivals must be arranged in advance by contacting prospective supervisors and managers. Placing “fill-ins” or coverage for missed shifts is the employee’s sole responsibility. Definitions Absence: Supervisor must be notified by the employee at least [duration] in advance. The employee will be absent from the assigned shift if the employee fails to notify supervisors [duration]. Unscheduled absence: An employee informs the supervisor immediately before the shift starts that they will be absent from the shift due to an emergency or other unexpected causes. Failure to notify the supervisor can result in the absence being counted as a “no show” or result in [consequence]. [Number] unscheduled absences will result in [consequence]. Tardiness: When an employee arrives at work at least [duration] minutes after the scheduled shift start. If the employee shows up later than [duration] after shift start time, tardiness will be recorded as an absence. After 20 tardies, the employee will be subject to [consequence] . No-show: If an employee fails to show up for a shift without notifying the supervisor, it will be a no-show. After 20 no-show, the employee will be subject to [consequence] . After 20 consecutive no-shows, the employee will be terminated. Sick days: Employee is absent from shift due to illness or doctor’s note. The employee’s sole responsibility is to notify the supervisor in case of illness or medical emergency. Otherwise, the absence will be counted as a “no-show.” Include additional guidelines about your company’s visions, goals, and responsible management. Information can include why it is essential to enact this policy. How to track employee time and attendance? Drafting and enacting an attendance policy is just one part of the job. To fully benefit from the procedure, you should have measures in place to track the time and attendance of the employees . For this purpose, you can install an attendance system. However, before you choose a product, it is essential to: 1. Identify the tracking needs of your business There is a significant difference in tracking the needs of businesses as their requirements differ. Several solutions are available to track employees’ time and attendance, but the choice depends on your requirement. For instance, if your company is in the IT industry, you will need an attendance system to track employee working hours and busy times on desktops. If you are in a domain like manufacturing and mining, your workforce will be distributed over a large area, and a standard attendance system will not work. You will need an attendance system with GPS-enabled tracking that can be used with minimal hardware. It will also help to choose a time and attendance management system that integrates with your accounting or payroll software to increase the productivity of the HR team. Such an attendance system will make dealing with time theft , absenteeism, and attendance regularization easier. 2. Choose the right time and attendance system Depending on the requirements above, you must choose an attendance system that can handle the HR requirements. Truein is a new-age face recognition attendance system that utilizes the power of AI to track and record attendance. The attendance system is cloud-based, enabling businesses to deploy its solutions for remote sites and field workers. This geofencing attendance system can ensure that the staff marks their attendance from a specified location. Furthermore, it offers features like mobile punching, leave management , the ability to create reports and set alerts, and easily integrates with accounting systems. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion We hope this guide provides you with a proper guideline for writing an attendance policy for your business.

How To Manage Overtime In The Construction Industry? July 23, 2024 The Indian construction industry is a major player contributing to the economy’s growth. At the center of the focus of the government’s initiatives to create world-class infrastructure in a time-bound manner, the construction industry is poised to receive investments of up to $1.4 trillion by 2025 . Without a doubt, the construction industry is crucial to driving the country’s growth, but it needs some reforms too. The industry is the second-largest employer, with over 51 million workers. Furthermore, the construction industry created 45 million additional jobs directly or indirectly. It is easy to anticipate that there certainly will be management challenges with such a large workforce. In this article, we will focus on overtime in the construction industry. We will take a look at the challenges and available solutions. Table of Contents What are the construction industry overtime rules? 6 Tips to manage overtime in the construction industry? 1. Identify the issue 2. Be aware of local overtime laws 3. Track work hours with GPS construction time tracking software 4. Cross-train employees 5. Hire contractors 6. Improve work allocation and management Conclusion What are the construction industry overtime rules? As the construction industry primarily has a workforce working at sites, time management is a complicated task to achieve. Keeping track of workers is a gigantic task. It is important to understand what laws govern and protect workers’ rights in the context of overtime. Here are the essential labor laws an employer must be aware of. Act Provisions under the Act Factories Act, 1948 Sec. 51, 54 to 56 & 59 of the Act include overtime wages. Under section 59 of the Factories Act, it is clearly instructed that a worker who works for more than 9 hours any day or for more than 48 hours in a week will be entitled to receive wages in respect to overtime work at the rate of twice his/her ordinary rate of wages. Minimum Wages Act, 1948 It also applied to construction workers. According to section 33 of the Minimum Wages Act, overtime wages must be twice the rate of the ordinary wages of the worker.Sec. 14 of the Act states that for workers, if the minimum rate of wages is fixed by the time period, such as by the hour, by the day, or by any such period, and if any worker works more than that number of hours, it will be considered overtime. Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 As per Rule 79 of the Act pertains to the law regarding overtime calculation for contract workers. According to the act, every contractor must maintain a Register of Overtime in Form XXIII. All important details like the employee's name, overtime calculation, hours of extra work, etc., must be recorded in the register. Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment Service) Act, 1996 Under Section 28 & 29 of the Act, it is mentioned that construction workers who work overtime as per the regulations mentioned above must be remunerated at the rate of twice the ordinary rate of wages. Companies struggling with managing overtime for construction workers can end up with losses. As the law requires to pay twice the ordinary wage rate, overtime can have substantial financial liabilities. Let’s explore some measures to control overtime in the construction industry. 6 Tips to manage overtime in the construction industry? 1. Identify the issue If unexplained overtime is reported in the company, it is essential to know why it is happening before resolving the issue. Overtime construction can result from several problems such as heavy project loads, poor time management, and staffing shortage . These are some of the issues on the management site. Audit the HR and managers’ logs to understand the staffing and work distribution. It is also not uncommon in the construction industry to find employees working overtime for the extra pay. You have to get a clear idea of the issues to decide how to manage overtime for construction workers. 2. Be aware of local overtime laws The central government of India implements the labor laws we have listed above, but there are specific local labor laws that a company must be aware of. For example, Maharashtra has tweaked the local labor law to allow longer working hours and overtime periods for workers. As per the rule, “ With the exemption from Sections 51,52, 54, and 56, employers can allow labourers to work in two shifts of 12 hours each.” 3. Track work hours with GPS construction time tracking software As mentioned above, tracking employees’ working hours is a significant challenge in the construction industry. Field workers are away from CCTVs, so there is no sure way to know if they are working or not. Using a GPS-based attendance system , you can overcome this challenge. Truein is a face recognition attendance system with geofencing and GPS tracking features. It can be used to record overtime for construction workers through the app on their smartphones. 4. Cross-train employees The skill gap is a problem that increases over time in the construction industry. If you do not have the workers with the required skills, it can slow down productivity. Also, if the company is understaffed, project tasks can take longer to complete. The solution lies in cross-training employees to take up multiple roles if there is demand. 5. Hire contractors Building on the above issue, if the overtime construction does not seem to stop even after cross-training workers because of staff shortage, you need to hire contractors. Hiring an independent contractor workforce can compensate for the deficit, and overtime can be eliminated. If the contractor uses an independent contractor time tracking app , it can help to manage and reduce overtime effectively. 6. Improve work allocation and management If the HR managers regularly cram overtime at the end of projects, it indicates poor time management. When you fail to anticipate the project’s timeline or resources, which will be required at the initial stages, the task becomes hard to manage as the deadline arrives. The managers must spread out hours from the beginning of the project so that no overtime occurs later. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion Unmanaged overtime in the construction industry can be a real nuisance.

Labor Shortage: What It Is, Why There Is A Shortage & How To Overcome It? June 25, 2024 The COVID-19 pandemic affected businesses in the worst ways possible. Revenues stopped, inventory was lying unused, debts increased exponentially, and many companies had to lay off employees to stay afloat. Interestingly, as the lockdown subsided and business operations returned to normal, companies experienced an unexpected labor shortage. Hiring workers has become increasingly difficult because of ongoing mass resignations and employees seeking more flexibility. This article will be a helpful resource if you are looking for strategies to overcome labor shortage issues. But, before we get started with the strategies to overcome labor shortages and retain employees, let’s first understand what a labor shortage is. Table of Contents What is a labor shortage? Why is there a labor shortage? 1. Poor compensation 2. Lack of flexibility 3. A question of purpose 8 Ways to deal with the labor shortage 1. Train and cross-train existing employees 2. Improve the work environment to reduce employees leaving the organization 3. Recognize and reward employees 4. Make opportunities for them to develop and grow 5. Automate tasks 6. Pay bounties to employees who bring new employees 7. Be flexible with schedules 8. Use time tracking tools Conclusion What is a labor shortage? The labor shortage is a term that indicates a gap between the labor needed in industry and the number of workers available to fill in the requirement. Simply put, there are more jobs available than the workers. It can be because workers are less willing to work in a position or a scarcity of skilled labor. The pandemic accelerated the labor shortage issue as, during the last two years, 1 in 4 workers quit their jobs since the pandemic and have not returned to work. It is becoming a struggle to find workers to fill open positions. Manufacturing, construction, hospitality, transportation, and healthcare are the most affected industries. If you pay attention, there is a common factor in all these industries-they require the workforce to be available in person during work hours. Also, most of these industries employ blue-collar workers and heavily rely on laborers to operate. Why is there a labor shortage? The labor shortage is not only because of fewer people willing to work; there can be several other factors contributing to your business’ struggle with finding or retaining the right talent. Be mindful that none of these reasons prevents you from retaining the workers. 1. Poor compensation This reason is easiest to anticipate. Workers want to be paid more, at least what they are worth. Industries like construction, mining, healthcare, and manufacturing especially face labor shortages as the pay is less than in other sectors. The limited wage is not enough to meet the increased cost of living and healthcare, pushing workers to look for positions that pay them better. 2. Lack of flexibility Since the pandemic, employees have been more discerning of opportunities that allow them to have a better work-life balance. Workers now seek increased flexibility, but employers remain reluctant to offer the same. According to a survey by Future Forums of 10,000 knowledge workers , employees want more flexibility in jobs and, if possible, location. As remote working is not an option for most of the mentioned industries, an evident lack of flexibility causes workers to look for work in other segments. 3. A question of purpose For many employers, it may seem inconsequential, but workers are increasingly losing their sense of purpose at work. Employees who are not connected to their workplace cannot be passionate about their jobs. It eventually forces them to leave work. If your company is facing a labor shortage, reevaluate the work environment, and if missing, try to create opportunities that will make employees feel more excited about their roles. Indeed surveyed workers who voluntarily left their jobs in 2020 and found that 92% of the respondents felt “life is too short to stay in a job they weren’t passionate about.” If workers do not feel connected with the company’s goal and vision, they may not be inspired to stay at the job. 8 Ways to deal with the labor shortage 1. Train and cross-train existing employees The mass exodus of the workers can leave companies in limbo if those leaving are skilled workers. You must implement training programs to help workers across domains acquire common skills to keep business operations up if there is a labor shortage. Cross-training employees can help. For instance, production staff can be trained to handle maintenance responsibilities if the situation arises. Cross-training does more than retain employees; it creates a sense of value and community. 2. Improve the work environment to reduce employees leaving the organization As we mentioned above, the work environment is one of the main reasons why employees work or leave a job. You are walking in circles if you are wondering how to solve workforce shortage without addressing the issues causing employees to leave. Ensure that the work environment is positively inductive for employees. For example, if you are in the manufacturing industry, your employees must feel safe at work with all safety measures. 3. Recognize and reward employees Acknowledging workers’ hard work and sincerity and rewarding them appropriately will boost their morale and keep them engaged. Make sure your employees are not feeling neglected, and their efforts are recognized and rewarded. Just offering perks alone is no more an incentive good enough to keep workers; you have to make them feel appreciated and valued as part of the team. 4. Make opportunities for them to develop and grow Pandemic has changed the workforce a lot. Everything needs improvement – skills required for the job, where and how work is performed, and what motivates the workforce. To overcome labor shortages and retain employees, you must create opportunities for them to learn and grow. Take a fresh look at the workforce and try to identify opportunities where you can introduce improvements. For instance, if your manufacturing unit relies on manual labor for production, you can introduce CNC machines for repetitive tasks and train the workers. This will present them with an opportunity to develop and grow. 5. Automate tasks If your company has scope for automation, explore solutions for the same. The more automated tasks are, the lesser workforce will be required. In the wake of the rising cost of labor and the shortage of workers, several companies have considered automation to reduce the up-front cost of hiring or maintaining a large workforce. Partnering with consulting firms to explore automation integration in the business processes will provide an answer to how to solve the workforce shortage. For example, you can use automation to help remove infrastructure bottlenecks and free up human resources to work on operations that contribute to the revenue directly. Learn more about HR automation here . 6. Pay bounties to employees who bring new employees Why not turn your workers into headhunters by offering them incentives for referring talent to the company? Instead of outsourcing the hiring process or relying on the HR team to solve workforce shortages, you can introduce a referral bonus for employees to bring in new talent. At some of the most successful companies, 28 to 30 percent of the new hires come from employee referrals . If they can do it, so can you. 7. Be flexible with schedules Flexibility is a requirement, not an option, to retain workers. Now employees seek a more positive work-life balance and opportunities that offer the flexibility to work. By creating flexible work schedules, you can let workers feel relaxed about their routine and not stressed. You can use employee shift scheduling software for that. It will help prevent employees from leaving. 8. Use time tracking tools Employees adequately compensated for their work time build trust in the managers and the company. Using time and attendance management tools to record attendance would be best. Such tools also free HR managers from manually managing attendance and shifts, a process often susceptible to human errors. Truein is a face recognition attendance system that can help companies schedule shifts , track timing, and efficiently distribute workloads among employees. It can automate report generation, directly integrate attendance records with payroll software, and for remote sites and field workers. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Conclusion There is no telling when markets will emerge victorious from the acute labor shortage facing businesses today. While the HR gurus can only make predictions based on surveys and studies, business owners need to make tough decisions. The strategies we have listed here are helping companies across the globe overcome the labor shortage. We hope you, too, can recognize what’s causing the labor shortage at your company and implement the appropriate measures to fill in the gaps.

What Causes It and How To Deal With It? What Is Employee Absenteeism? What Causes It and How To Deal With It? June 25, 2024 Workers are humans, and as HR managers, it is crucial to understand that some level of absenteeism in the workforce is inevitable. Falling ill, injuries, personal business, or occasional requirement to look after a family member, there can be several instances when an employee has to take off. Table of Contents But when do you know that employee absenteeism is too much? What is employee absenteeism? Who is affected by employee absenteeism? 5 Reasons for employee absenteeism 1. Low employee engagement 2. Time theft can also be considered absenteeism 3. Lack of a flexible working 4. Workplace burnout 5. Substance abuse and stress 8 Ways to deal with employee absenteeism 1. Create an employee attendance policy 2. Take employee opinions 3. Adopt a flexible work schedule 4. Do employee engagement programs 5. Start employee wellness programs 6. Give rewards or incentives to employees 7. Provide one to two weeks of paid time off 8. Keep track of employee absences How To Discuss Absenteeism With Your Employee Conclusion But when do you know that employee absenteeism is too much? When unscheduled absences become a norm and impact the company’s productivity, HR managers must take action. While a flexible schedule is a great way to retain employees and attract talent, rampant absenteeism can negatively impact workforce morale and create a bottleneck for the bottom line. This is why leading organizations proactively discuss strategies to deal with employee absenteeism. This article will discuss everything related to employee absenteeism and how to manage absenteeism effectively. What is employee absenteeism? In simple terms, employee absenteeism is the frequent lack of attendance without reasonable cause or proper notification. Absenteeism is a repeated behavior and doesn’t include occasional no-call, no-show, or absences in instances that cannot be controlled like illness, sudden climate change, broken car, etc. For an organization, it is essential to have measures in place to guide HR managers in dealing with absenteeism at work. Employee absenteeism is on the rise , and ever since the pandemic, it is becoming even more challenging for companies to take control of the situation when more people are calling in sick when they aren’t. In the long term, employee absenteeism can affect a company’s productivity. There are associated financial risks, too, as absenteeism-linked productivity losses cost U.S. companies $225.8 billion annually . HR professionals must be capable of making decisions on how to deal with excessive absenteeism in the workplace to avoid such losses. Who is affected by employee absenteeism? The answer might seem straightforward. Companies are at the most loss if they cannot control absenteeism, but they are not the only ones at a loss. While the costs to the company are pretty high, absenteeism affects employees too. It paves the way for poor work ethics that sets a dangerous precedent for new employees to follow. Employees who are regular with their attendance feel discouraged to continue to be so as they witness absenteeism. Speaking of monetary losses, according to the publication titled Absenteeism: The Bottom-Line Killer , Unscheduled absenteeism is a chronic problem for U.S. employers, conservatively costing $3,600 per hourly employee per year, and $2,650 per salaried employee per year. Apart from these direct losses, there are indirect costs such as wages paid to absent employees, poor quality of goods/services resulting from understaffing, and administrative expenses of managing absenteeism. 5 Reasons for employee absenteeism We understand that employee absenteeism is too high of a risk of being left unattended. Still, HR professionals must know what factors result in absenteeism to nip the evil in the bud. 1. Low employee engagement No company can have a dedicated workforce without ensuring employee engagement in the work culture. If there is a lack of activities to bring employees closer to their workplace, they will feel disengaged at work. It is essential for employee engagement and productivity that they feel connected to the workplace. When your workplace lacks employee engagement, the chances of absenteeism are high. 2. Time theft can also be considered absenteeism Company productivity is affected when employees are absent without informing, but time theft also results in the same losses for the company. When employees take unnecessarily long breaks, are frequently late to work, or leave early, they are essentially committing absenteeism. It is a practice that raises a question for the HR manager about the dedication and commitment of the employees. If unchecked, time theft can hurt the sentiments and morale of honest employees, further worsening the situation. 3. Lack of a flexible working Since the pandemic, employees are more discerning of the work-life balance and seek opportunities that allow them to focus on both. If a company has too rigid shifts leaving little scope for flexibility, it can be a significant reason for employee absenteeism. Lack of flexibility can be one of the biggest reasons employees miss work without prior notice. 4. Workplace burnout Burnout leads to ill-performance among employees. When there are no measures to avoid rigorous and unscheduled working conditions, employees face burnout that results in unscheduled absences. Employees must get breaks to rejuvenate. If a company overexposes its workforce to work, it can lead to the degradation of their interest in work. 5. Substance abuse and stress An issue that is widely known but less discussed, substance abuse among employees, can be a real problem. Employees succumb to substance abuse in some industries to relieve work stress and rejuvenate. Alcoholism is one typical example of substance abuse among employees. However, such abuse is detrimental to the employees’ physical and mental health. It degrades their motor functions and thinking ability, leaving them unfit for performing their duties. 8 Ways to deal with employee absenteeism Now that we know the main reasons let’s discuss how to deal with staff absenteeism. 1. Create an employee attendance policy Employee attendance policy helps the company communicate what is expected of the employees for attendance. This policy is a document that clearly states what is considered absenteeism and how will be the consequences of unauthorised absence . Employees must be aware of what the company expects from them to stick with the rules. 2. Take employee opinions Companies can understand how the workforce thinks and feels through employee opinions and surveys. The insights gained through surveys can help tackle the question- of how to deal with absenteeism in the workplace. Ask employees about commuting to work, schedule, personal issues, job satisfaction, etc. 3. Adopt a flexible work schedule As we mentioned above, that lack of flexibility can disengage workers. Adopt a flexible work schedule to allow workers to find a work-life balance and have more time for themselves and their loved ones. 4. Do employee engagement programs Ideally, the workplace should not only be about work but should provide opportunities for employees to bond and engage on a personal level. Employee engagement programs are excellent at bridging the gap between employees and their employers. Such programs make employees feel acknowledged and appreciated for their work. 5. Start employee wellness programs Wellness programs can help address health issues that employees face due to work. Such wellness programs fit within an employee’s regular work schedule. When you start a wellness program in the workplace, workers are encouraged to stay fit and healthy, ultimately providing you with a solution to how to deal with employee absenteeism. 6. Give rewards or incentives to employees If unscheduled absences must be punished, then you must incentivize an excellent attendance record, and punctual employees must be rewarded. It will keep their morale high and let others know that their presence in the workplace will be highly appreciated. 7. Provide one to two weeks of paid time off The work schedule must not bound employees; that’s why flexibility is a must. However, it is vital to provide paid time off to employees to let them have time for themselves and family. Paid time off is an excellent way to reduce employee absenteeism. 8. Keep track of employee absences HR managers can take steps and decide how to handle employee absenteeism only when they know the severity of the situation. It is essential to track employee absences properly to make the right decisions. For this, the Truein face recognition system can be highly effective. An AI-based cloud attendance and leave management system , Truein comes with in-built features to help managers and supervisors keep track of employees. As it is a GPS-based attendance system and can be deployed with an app on a worker’s phone, it is much easier to keep track of employee attendance. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account How To Discuss Absenteeism With Your Employee Unplanned Absenteeism can frustrate you as an employer but do not jump the gun and right away question your employee’s professionalism and integrity. Discuss with your employee in a 1 to 1 meeting and get a reasoning from them on the reason behind their unplanned leaves. Absenteeism can also stem from non work related issues. It is therefore important that you show your employees you care and try finding solutions if it is a genuine non work related issue that may be impacting them personally. In other scenarios, clearly communicate to employees the company policies and procedures and the importance of adhering to them. Address the issue as soon as you see it. Create a plan with them and discuss the next steps that would occur if their absenteeism continues. Also praise and reward them when you see improvement in your employee attendance. Conclusion Employee absenteeism is a real nuisance that requires well-thought strategies to tackle challenges before they consume revenues and nose-dive productivity. We hope this guide will provide you an insight into what is causing unscheduled absences at your workplace and the strategies to deal with employee absenteeism.
