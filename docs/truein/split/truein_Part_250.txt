It involves careful consideration and planning as it is affected by both internal and external factors. As a manager, you will be tasked with workforce management decisions. It will involve specifying the number of available workers and will be required to carry out business operations optimally. To be able to devise a plan to increase or decrease manpower sustainably requires forecasting. It helps companies use the available resources to the fullest by identifying and reorganizing the team workers to improve productivity. In this article, we will explore manpower forecasting in human resource planning. Table of Contents What is manpower forecasting? Why manpower forecasting is needed? Different methods of manpower forecasting 1. Work-load analysis 2. Workforce analysis Conclusion What is manpower forecasting? Manpower forecasting helps prevent shortages of workers and laborers within the company by accessing the current workforce levels. It also helps quantify how many people and positions can be expected soon. With systematic manpower forecasting, businesses can meet the human resource requirements of future business challenges. This is why manpower forecasting is critical to meet your organization’s business goals. When a company fails to forecast manpower needs, there can be a severe gestational lag in the workforce. It can exist at any level of manpower. For example, if you are in the manufacturing industry, you will need skilled machinists who can operate CNC machines. Suppose there is an upcoming surge in production to meet the increased customer demand, but there is no manpower forecasting. How will you anticipate or prepare your workers to meet the increased production demand? Manpower forecasting facilities design skilling programs for the workers to ensure no gap in the workforce. This is how you can maintain the correct quantity and quality of manpower as and when required. At the organizational level, the absence of manpower forecasting can result in acute understaffing or underutilization of highly skilled workers in the company. Why manpower forecasting is needed? Manpower forecasting is essential to maintain the correct headcount per the company’s requirements and objectives. Foremost, you require manpower forecasting to anticipate the need for increased labor to maintain optimal productivity within the company. Another important reason why manpower forecasting in human resource planning is critical is to maintain the pool of skilled workers. For instance, if your manufacturing unit has installed machinery that requires providing operators with specialized training, you must start using such machines for production before you can begin using such machines for production. You will need trained workers to operate the machines to keep production optimal. With manpower forecasting, you can facilitate training planning well in advance. It is the only way to ensure that required manpower, both in terms of quality and quantities, is available when you need it. The labor market fluctuation is another reason manpower planning and forecasting are essential for businesses. A recent example is how the COVID-19 pandemic spooked the labor market, resulting in large-scale unemployment and a shortage of available labor. There was a large gap between the demand and supply in the labor market. To mitigate such workforce risks, the human resource must plan the supply of workers to meet the demand as it arises. Manpower planning and forecasting ensure that you always have a poll of skilled labor to support production and protect your revenues against labor market distortions. Another reason for manpower forecasting is in the short run, where you have to anticipate upskilling existing workers to support the production of goods and services. It is often required when companies choose to upgrade existing technological infrastructure. There arises a need to train workers to avoid skill shortages. Manpower forecasting can help companies stay afloat, such as upskilling requirements. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Different methods of manpower forecasting Simply put, manpower forecasting is the process of estimating future human resource requirements. As mentioned before, manpower forecasting in human resource planning can be affected by internal and external factors; you must use the correct methods of manpower forecasting suitable for your organization. Here are the most common methods of manpower forecasting: 1. Work-load analysis It is a suitable method of manpower forecasting for industries where the workload can be easily measured, such as construction, mining, and manufacturing. Workload analysis involves a set of processes to calculate the workload of a position, sub-position, and the number of workers required to fill the position and sub-position. Suppose a company has an estimated production of 1 50,000 units, and it takes two man hours to produce each unit. Also, the previously calculated workability of each employee is 1500 man-hours per annum. Workload analysis can be used to calculate the demand for human resources as follows: Estimated total annual production = 1, 50,000 units Standard man-hours required to produce each unit = 2 hrs Estimated man-hours needed to meet production goal (1,50,000 x 2) = 300000 hrs Workability/contribution per employee = 1500 units Estimated no. of workers needed = 3,00,000/1500 = 200 The example shows that the company will require 200 workers in a year to maintain the production level of 1 50,000 units. This is a simple example. Workload analysis also considers other factors like absenteeism rate, rate of labor turnover, machine breakdown, strikes, power failure, etc. 2. Workforce analysis Workforce analysis makes the foundation for manpower planning and forecasting. It determines the rate of influx and outflow of employees. It also provides a sufficient margin for labor turnover, absenteeism, and idle time to make accurate workforce forecasts to meet production requirements. For data, workforce analysis relies on tools that record overtime, leaves, and absenteeism. Truein is a robust manpower attendance management tool with advanced leave, absence, overtime, and shift scheduling capabilities. As a hardware-less, cloud-based employee time and attendance application , it can be deployed at any business unit; be it manufacturing, construction, mining, etc. Schedule a free demo today and see how it can help to automate attendance management in your organization. Conclusion Manpower forecasting is an efficient way to anticipate future human resource demands by utilizing past data. It provides an exact approximation of the expected changes in the workforce demands to understand the possible changes in manpower clearly. Forecasting manpower needs give businesses the ability to cope with emerging challenges. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

In the past, companies focused more on revenue, competition, and economic instability. However, human resource management is more important today to keep skilled workers and talent, which is necessary for competitive advantage. Human resource management problems and solutions revolve around people because they are the most critical asset for a company and have the power to influence its growth and sustainability. HRM involves several responsibilities, from workforce recruitment to continual training and development and legal compliance. There are numerous challenges of HRM in India that expand over three domains. These can be environmental such as the economy and legal compliances, organizational life restructuring, competition, and management change, and individuals that can include work ethics, growth, and empowerment. This article highlights some major human resource management problems and solutions you must know as a manager. Table of Contents Eight human resource management problems and solutions 1. Compliance with laws and regulations 2. Health and safety of staff 3. Building leadership within the team 4. Attracting and retaining top talents 5. Providing compensation and benefits to staff 6. Adding diversity in the workplace 7. Creating a value-oriented company culture 8. Monitoring productivity and performance of staff Conclusion Eight human resource management problems and solutions 1. Compliance with laws and regulations The countries are amending Labour laws to be more employee-friendly. This is becoming a challenge for organizations, especially small and medium enterprises, as they need more resources to keep pace with such regulatory changes. This is because smaller companies don’t usually have focused departments for HR that can update the company employment policies by changing laws. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can make your organization liable for a lawsuit. The compliance laws and regulations are not only related to hiring practices but are also associated with staff benefits, payments, overtime, and other aspects of employment. Understanding these acts and legislation can be difficult for managers because the correct interpretation is necessary for adherence. An easy solution to this HRM problem is to hire statutory compliance agencies. It saves time, and you receive expert opinions and consultation on all the policies and guidelines that are a must for your industry. This convenience comes at a cost, but it’s a small price to pay compared to the risks of non-compliance and the threat to your brand image. 2. Health and safety of staff Similar to laws and regulations, it is human resources’ responsibility to ensure the workers’ health and safety within the company. The challenge is creating and enforcing health and safety processes within the organization. Your organization must have employee training programs to help them understand the health and safety measures necessary for the role. In an industry such as mining, manufacturing, or construction, tracking workplace injuries or safety violations becomes a challenge due to the extensive work area. The solution is to create a designated health and safety committee within your organization. If you are a small or medium-scale enterprise, you can assign a single person to that role. You must provide tools and training to the workers so that they understand local health and safety laws. You must empower them to change, upgrade or even shut down operations in case of an accident or injury. For any company, the health and safety of the workers should be a top priority. 3. Building leadership within the team When you’re too focused on creating resources and training tools for the staff, it is easy to overlook the need for grooming leaders within the workforce. A common misconception that hinders the growth and success of organizations is that leaders do not need to learn more; even if they do, it can be achieved through self-learning. Leaders are essential in influencing the organizational structure and deciding staff satisfaction. You will face frequent employer and employee conflicts if you lack leadership grooming. Such disagreements result in an unhealthy work environment, adversely affecting the morale and productivity of your workers. The solution lies in creating a learning and development strategy targeting employees at all levels within the organizational chart. It is essential that leaders are trained, mentored, and guided by mentors within the management. You can also create human resource management challenges and solution PDFs and share them with prospective leaders. While future leaders can learn technical aspects independently, soft skills like having difficult conversations, conducting meetings, and providing developmental feedback require experience, mentoring, and exposure. You mustn’t lose leaders to organizational growth and provide them with an environment to grow in their roles. 4. Attracting and retaining top talents Competition is one of the essential factors that must be kept into consideration when planning HR strategies. It is even more pressing for small and medium companies because hiring and retaining skilled workers is difficult when they compete with big names and brands. Recruitment is challenging, but retention is only possible if you are providing staff with the correct benefits, opportunities, exposure, and a positive work environment. Attracting and retaining top talent is one of the most significant challenges of HRM in India. The solution is to create a strong employer brand to attract top talent into your organization. Employees can do background checks on the company and understand their employer’s value easily by connecting with other workers from the same company through social media. Having a strong positive brand presence on these platforms works in your favor. An easy way to show prospective staff you care is by being active in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). These activities are a privilege for your organization to give back to society and act as the emotional platform for employee and employer bonding. Furthermore, the onboarding process at the company should be smooth, and new workers should have a leisurely experience working in the new work environment. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 5. Providing compensation and benefits to staff The competition in the corporate world makes it difficult for organizations to keep up with the compensation and benefits offered. Large companies can provide significant compensation and benefits to the workers, but it is a challenge for HRM at small and medium enterprises to keep up with the offering. This makes recruitment and retention extremely difficult. The increased cost of hiring also includes taxes, human capital investments, and training charges. Such an item of expenditure can be a threat to your company’s progress and success. If you cannot offer high compensation like your competition, you can still be a strong contender by offering attractive benefits. You can offer variable and performance-based components to the staff. This will encourage them to perform better. Also, you can start substantial reward and recognition programs to attract performance. Also, organizations can choose to increase healthcare costs to offer family benefits to the workers. Smaller organizations can offer flexible benefits such as extended vacation time, flexible timings, well-being programs, and transportation benefits. 6. Adding diversity in the workplace Having diversity in the workforce is a boon for any organization. Bringing people from diverse cultures and ethnicities enhances your organization’s problem-solving capability and innovation. However, for human resource management, this also brings challenges related to diversity in age, gender, nationality, culture, etc. It is a great challenge to cater to the unique requirements of the workers dependent on their age, gender, or ethnicity. As a manager, maintaining employee engagement while fostering effective communication when workers from different backgrounds work together is difficult because employee disagreements are much more frequent. To resolve conflicts arising due to diversity, human resource management must make arrangements to sensitize all staff to respect and show compassion towards the culture of other people they are working with. You can make culture orientation part of the onboarding process within your company. Your organization’s values and work culture should prioritize respecting each other’s culture and beliefs. Teambuilding activities help align employees with integrating different cultures and backgrounds. You can set a standard of behavior within the workplace so workers are aware of what is expected from their conduct and behavior. It’s essential to have a company culture that is welcoming and comfortable. 7. Creating a value-oriented company culture The company culture is critical to dealing with human resource management problems and solutions in the long run. The modern workforce expects to work for a company that has healthy work culture. They emphasized proper work/life balance over salary and benefits. If you need to create a value-oriented company culture, you risk losing a skilled workforce to the competition. The most effective way to create a value-oriented work environment is to empower your workers through recognition, incentives, and power. You benefit your employer brand by allowing workers to grow by encouraging them to adhere to the company’s values. This is one of India’s most significant challenges in human resource management. Still, you can easily deal with it by encouraging staff to work on what interests them apart from the responsibilities mentioned in their job description. 8. Monitoring productivity and performance of staff Productivity and performance within the company are shared responsibilities between human resource management and managers. As a manager, you are ultimately responsible for your team’s performance. However, if your team is not performing or its productivity is low, it is the HRM’s responsibility to make tough decisions regarding your team. In such a scenario, several human resource management problems arise. They have to decide how to monitor the performance and productivity levels of the workers to ensure that business operation is at an optimum level. Identifying the root cause of low performance requires cross-functionally verifying the reasons with managers and workers. It can be challenging to report human resource issues to the executive team for strategic decisions without proper monitoring of the productivity and performance of the workers. To monitor productivity and performance, key indicators need to be monitored so that you have two ensure that you don’t come too strong, making workers feel uncomfortable due to continuous monitoring. The potential solutions include using HR platforms to integrate performance management, goal management, and performance tracking. You must study the teams achieving their goals to understand what they’re doing right and then incorporate those findings for other groups. Also, you must keep the lines of communication open for all the managers to report any issues or challenges they face before things get worse.

It helps companies grow sustainably while assisting them in using the available resources more efficiently. The most expensive but critical resource for running a company is manpower. Manpower budgeting can make or break your business growth. The challenge is many managers do not know how manpower budgeting in HR works. Budgeting is essential for covering the expenses related to recruitment, training, salaries, and benefits in the best manner for your company. Manpower budgeting help companies take away any underlying surprises that can compromise or make it difficult to build a strong workforce. If you are repeatedly facing uncertainty with workforce management , hiring, and worker retention, you might need a manpower budget, as we are about to discuss. Table of Contents What is manpower budgeting? Why do you need to plan a manpower budget? How to prepare a manpower budget? 1. Define the business goals 2. Review past budgets 3. Analyze and forecast worker needs 4. Plan for the best and worst-case scenarios Things to consider while creating a manpower budget 1. Tools for data collection 2. Keep reviewing the manpower plan 3. Training workers Example of manpower budget Conclusion What is manpower budgeting? Manpower budgeting involves systematically collecting data and information so that the finances needed to support a company’s production and service objectives can be projected. Every successful company has a manpower budgeting process in the overall HR management. Before working on manpower budgeting, a company must create strategic planning to identify the annual goals and objectives. This is an important step in manpower budgeting as it allows the managers to concentrate the allotted budgets on supporting the planned objectives. At companies, usually, there are two methods of manpower budgeting in HR. Incremental budgeting: In this type of manpower budgeting, you adjust the current budget to align the output per the forecasted expectations. Zero-based budgeting: In this form of manpower budgeting in HR, every item in the budget must be justified before it is included in the budget strategy. Therefore, it begins with a clean slate, no prior budgets involved. Why do you need to plan a manpower budget? Large businesses often focus on planning and forecasting to anticipate upcoming opportunities to keep their growth continuous and sustainable. Now, if the anticipated opportunities are realized and converted into a business, you will need workers and laborers to start working on them. However, there is always a looming threat that you might overhire, and the increase in workers means additional labor costs that can eat up your revenues. This is why you need manpower budgeting to support hiring additional skilled manpower without derailing your annual budget. This is achieved through manpower budgeting. As part of manpower budget planning, managers determine how and when new workers will be hired to work for the company. The process focuses on achieving the organization’s goal without extending the manpower budget or exploiting workers. Manpower budgeting is mandatory for any company that wants to be prepared for the future with the adequate number of workers at their disposal necessary for prosperity. Workforce budgeting is different for every company, depending on the business objective. Based on your company objectives, you have to create a custom budgeting plan to decide on improving the workers and the company. How to prepare a manpower budget? Manpower budgeting involves several steps, and the final process will depend on the type of workforce you employ and the existing HR budget policies. 1. Define the business goals Your manpower budget planning must align with the business goals. The first step is determining your business’s priorities and then handling lesser critical areas. For instance, at large manufacturing units, it is essential to encourage HR to be involved in all areas of corporate strategy because they better understand the workforce requirement. 2. Review past budgets It helps if you review the past budget for spending and performance data. It provides valuable insights for manpower budgeting as you learn and improve on the outcomes of the previous budgets. 3. Analyze and forecast worker needs Planning for recruitment needs provides you an advantage when manpower budgeting. You must know the number of workers employed in every department and how the overall workforce number compares to the turnover rate and project performance. 4. Plan for the best and worst-case scenarios Suppose you look at how manpower management was disrupted during the 2020-22 period due to the pandemic. In that case, it is a sign that manpower planning and budgeting can assist you in dealing with difficult situations easily. Your manpower budgeting must focus on the best and worst of the market. For instance, if your company has an annual employee turnover of 5%, but if it increases to 20% due to a pandemic or economic slowdown, you need to have a budget planned to spend on recruiting more workers to replace the ones leaving. Things to consider while creating a manpower budget 1. Tools for data collection Manpower budgeting has data at its core, which is why companies must have tools to analyze trends in workforce management. Truein is a cloud-based, hardware-less staff time and attendance management system that can help with manpower budgeting.

Training workers Workers must be trained to have the best skills, knowledge, and understanding of their roles. The purpose of training must make them ready for current roles as well as future requirements. Example of manpower budget Construction companies make ideal manpower budget examples as they often face problems hiring workers for upcoming projects. As the construction industry has many laborers employed, attrition is also high. Such companies need to have the manpower available to handle forthcoming projects but also be vary to hiring too many workers. Construction companies use forecasting and planning per the market requirements to remain operational and profitable in the long term.
