If you are running a plant, factory, or office that requires employees to follow shifts, you can set the shifts in Truein. Automatic allocation of shifts Automatic shift allocation is a very handy feature because shifts keep changing and admins don’t have to manually regulate it. Depending on the attendance time logged in by the shift employee, he can be automatically assigned a shift in the attendance log. For instance, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. is a general shift as defined by you. If he comes in at 9 a.m., he will automatically be assigned general shift. To activate this feature, follow these two steps: Step 1: Create shifts by specifying time slots for each shift Web Dashboard > Workforce plan > Shifts > Add new shift > Add the shift details as required Step 2: Enable the ‘Auto-assign shift for Clock-In within X hour of shift start time’ funationality You can setup the hours as required You can also bulk assign shifts to staff based on the roster Is it possible to assign shifts based on the roster?
