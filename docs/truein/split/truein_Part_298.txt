To build a team of reliable and skilled cleaning professionals, follow these steps: 1. Discover what your small business needs Before hiring cleaners for your small business, you must understand the specific needs of your cleaning or janitorial business. Some important considerations to make are: The volume and types of cleaning services you offer. Your operational hours. The geographic areas you serve. What services will you provide, such as commercial, residential, or industrial cleaning? The size of your current workforce. Gaps or areas that need new skills. Decide where you need full-time, part-time, or independent contractors. Once you understand your business’s unique requirements, you can quickly identify suitable candidates who can meet these needs effectively. 2. Write a job description that attracts the best candidates The next step is to ensure that you write a concise and attractive job description to get the attention of the suitable candidates. A compelling job description includes: Company profile and values A clear and detailed job title such as cleaning technician, janitor, cleaner A summary of the position’s responsibilities and duties, including specific cleaning tasks and maintenance activities Skills and experience the services require Type of employee (full-time, part-time, contract) Salary or hourly pay Please ensure that while your job description provides all the relevant information, it should be at most 300 words. LinkedIn says shorter job posts (300 words or less) attract 8.4% more candidates than longer posts . Information in the job description should align with the values of your organization. Ensure the job description is informative and engaging to capture the interest of potential candidates. 3. Screen candidates for essential qualities and skills Once you post the ad, you will receive applications from interested candidates. It’s time to screen candidates for essential qualities and skills. If you are new to the screening process, here are a few things to consider. Look for relevant experience: You will likely receive applications with varying experiences. It would be best if you looked for candidates with previous experience in cleaning or janitorial roles. If you have some specific requirements, look for their familiarity with cleaning techniques, equipment, and safety protocols requirements for the job. There is much to pay attention to, such as assessing candidates for punctuality, consistency, and work ethic. In the cleaning business, reliability is crucial as clients depend on consistent and timely service. Furthermore, when hiring cleaners, look for physical fitness as most roles require physical stamina, so candidates should be physically fit to perform cleaning tasks efficiently. Checking references is also essential to verify the work history and reliability of the candidates. It will inform you about their performance with previous employers. 4. Onboard and train new employees effectively Once you hire the right cleaning staff, the next crucial step is to onboard and train them effectively to ensure they are equipped to deliver high-quality cleaning services. An ideal onboarding and training process includes introducing new hires to company policies, procedures, and safety protocols. Give them hands-on training in cleaning techniques and equipment operation under the supervision of experienced staff. If they will be working with specific properties or locations, they should be given a tour of where they will be working. Before you put them in service, review client expectations and any special requests. Also, cleaning staff should receive ongoing training and performance evaluations to ensure continuous improvement. These four steps can simplify cleaning business hiring. Following these steps, you can hire the right employees for your cleaning or janitorial business. How do you prepare for hiring cleaners? Hiring cleaners for your business requires preparation, and there are some prerequisites you must complete before you start hiring and onboarding the right candidates. You must have the employer identification number (EIN) for cleaning business hiring. You can obtain EIN through the IRS. Your business should be registered with the state labor department to remain compliant for hiring. All businesses are required to report new hiring to their states. Depending on your location, you must disclose employee information to your state’s new-hire reporting agency . You must have the right payroll and record-keeping solutions in place. Get all legal requirements completed, such as workers’ compensation insurance, employment contract or at-will agreement, employee handbook, etc. Collect the necessary information via personal data form for payroll purposes, disability, family leave, and other federal policies. Get your business in shape to allow employees to work in a safe environment. For this, you must create standard operating procedures for tasks, set up workplace safety programs, order uniforms and safety gear for cleaners, etc. Also, you must create a channel for cleaners to report issues, ask questions, or seek assistance when needed. It is essential to address any concerns or grievances promptly and professionally. Traits to look for when hiring cleaning staff When customers hire a cleaning service, they expect the staff to be polite, dedicated, and experienced. This is why, when hiring cleaning staff, you should look for individuals with the right skills and personal attributes. Here are vital traits to look for when hiring cleaners: 1. Experience and skills: While if you are hiring freshers, then knowledge is not necessary, previous experience and cleaning skills can be a bonus. Assess their familiarity with cleaning chemicals, equipment, and techniques relevant to your business’s needs. 2. Reliability: If your cleaners work unsupervised, it is a paramount trait. Dependable employees are reliable as they adhere to schedules, meet deadlines, and maintain consistent quality in their cleaning services. You can use the references in their application to know about their past job attendance and reliability. 3. Adaptability and problem-solving skills: It is common for cleaning staff to encounter unexpected situations or challenges. It would help if you looked for individuals who can adapt to changing circumstances and solve problems effectively. When cleaners can solve problems, big and small, independently, they can work without supervision. 4. Friendliness and approachable: Interaction with clients is part of the job if your cleaning business offers residential or commercial cleaning. Your employees must be courteous, respectful, and able to handle client requests or complaints professionally. Evaluate a candidate’s customer service skills before you hire them. 5. Trustworthiness and integrity: Given the nature of the cleaning work, it often involves being in clients’ private spaces. Therefore, the trustworthiness of the cleaning staff is crucial. Background checks are essential, but you can also gauge interview integrity by discussing hypothetical ethical dilemmas. What after you hire the right cleaning staff for your cleaning business? Once you have hired the right cleaning staff, it is time to integrate them into your workforce. The cleaning business, like every other business, must adhere to rules regarding wages, overtime, leaves, etc. One challenge cleaning businesses face is that they must keep track of the time and attendance of distributed cleaning staff.

The Cleaning Staff Hiring Process After determining the number of cleaning staff required and the types of cleaning services you offer, you are in a position to write a detailed job description outlining job responsibilities, qualifications, work hours, and any special requirements. Once you start receiving applications from interested candidates after posting the job opening on relevant platforms such as job boards, your company website, social media, and local classified ads, you should know how to screen for suitable candidates. 1. Setup the initial interview Review resumes and applications to shortlist candidates based on qualifications and relevant experience. Conduct phone or video interviews with shortlisted cleaning candidates to assess their availability, communication skills, and initial fit with your company culture. If you are satisfied after discussing their previous cleaning experience and willingness to perform various cleaning tasks, you can schedule an in-person interview. 2. In-person interview Invite promising candidates for in-person interviews and use structured interview questions to evaluate their cleaning, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills. 3. Check references and background checks Cross-checking the provided references would help verify candidates’ work history, reliability, and professionalism. As cleaning companies often work in clients’ personal spaces, it is necessary to conduct background checks to ensure candidates have a clean criminal record. 4. Final interview (optional) Conduct a final interview with top candidates to discuss terms of employment, including pay, benefits, work schedules, and company policies. At this step, you extend formal job offers to selected candidates and ensure they understand and accept the terms and conditions of employment. Common problems and solutions for hiring cleaning staff Cleaning companies hiring have some common problems. Familiarity with these problems can help you create the right strategies and solutions to overcome these challenges. Let’s have a look at some common problems. 1. You take too long to reply to candidates Cleaning staff turnover is common, and there is always demand for janitorial service providers, so you must quickly reply to eligible candidates to avoid challenges in finding the right people to join your workforce. Therefore, you should promptly reply to potential candidates and offer them competitive wages and benefits to attract and retain them. Also, you should create a positive work environment and recognize and reward good performance. 2. Using manual data entry for candidate tracking If you are a small business and have limited hiring needs, then you can trust the good old spreadsheets to maintain records of candidates. However, to become efficient in hiring candidates, you must find an alternative to manually inputting applicant information. Remember that tasks performed manually hinder scalability, making it challenging to expand your operations. Automate application screening and data management with software solutions so you spend less time entering data into spreadsheets and more time maintaining your business. 3. You handle hiring on your own As a business owner, you have several responsibilities to take care of. You cannot assume the sole responsibility for reviewing resumes and contacting candidates, as it will slow down the hiring workflow. Suppose you struggle with finding time for other responsibilities because you are busy scheduling interviews and reviewing resumes and applications most of the time. In that case, consider hiring a virtual assistant (VA) or utilizing software to streamline these processes. Conclusion This guide provides steps to establish an effective cleaning staff hiring process that ensures you select and retain qualified individuals who can meet your business’s or client’s cleaning needs. Hiring candidates with the right traits and qualifications can build a strong and reliable cleaning team that effectively meets your client’s needs.

What's an alternative to hiring a cleaner? An alternative to hiring a full-time or part-time cleaner is considering professional cleaning services or outsourcing your cleaning needs to a cleaning company. These companies typically have a team of trained cleaners who can provide one-time or recurring cleaning services for your home or business. Hiring a cleaning service allows you to access cleaning expertise without the responsibilities of hiring and managing an in-house cleaner. It can be a cost-effective and flexible solution for many individuals and businesses. 2. When should I hire more cleaning employees? There can be various scenarios when you can require more cleaning employees. This includes: Increased demand for your cleaning services- If the workload exceeds the capacity of your current cleaning staff, resulting in longer response times or compromised quality of service, it’s time to hire additional employees. Seasonal variations may also require hiring more staff during peak periods to manage the increased demand- Suppose your current cleaning staff is consistently overworked, experiencing burnout, or taking frequent leaves of absence. In that case, it’s a sign that you need to hire more employees to distribute the workload effectively. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

Understanding these laws is necessary to ensure compliance with state regulations and help employers establish a positive work environment for employees. As of 2024, there are several aspects of Nebraska PTO laws that include vacation policies, sick leave, family leave, bereavement leave, jury duty leave, military leave, voting leave, and holiday leave. We understand it can be overwhelming for any employer, so we created this guide on Nebraska PTO laws. Read on to learn more about these laws and how you can establish fair and consistent policies that benefit both employees and the organization. Table of Contents Vacation Policies in Nebraska: What Can Employers Offer? Use-It-or-Lose-It Policies: Are They Allowed in Nebraska? Is vacation time treated as wages in Nebraska? Sick Leave in Nebraska: What Employers Need to Know Family Leave in Nebraska: Maternity, Paternity, and More Bereavement Leave: Is It Required in Nebraska? Jury Duty Leave in Nebraska: What's the Employer's Role? Military Leave: What Protections Exist in Nebraska? Voting Leave: What's Allowed in Nebraska? Holiday Leave in Nebraska: What Employers Can Decide How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion Vacation Policies in Nebraska: What Can Employers Offer? Nebraska law does not mandate specific vacation policies for employers, providing flexibility in designing vacation benefits. Therefore, employers have full discretion in creating vacation policies tailored to their business needs depending on their industry and workforce. However, a business’s vacation policies, including accrual rates, carryover limits, and usage guidelines, must be clearly communicated to employees through employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements. Furthermore, employers must adhere to the agreed-upon vacation policies. Additionally, employers should review and update their vacation policies to align with current regulations and industry standards. Use-It-or-Lose-It Policies: Are They Allowed in Nebraska? In Nebraska, ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ vacation policies are legally prohibited. The ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ policy stipulates that employees must use their accrued vacation time within a certain period, usually by year-end, or forfeit. Employers use such policies to encourage employees to take time off for rest and rejuvenation, aligning with the employer’s workforce management strategies. Nevada is one of the four states, including California, Nebraska, and Montana, that prohibit the use of use-it-or-lose-it policies. However, employers can cap the vacation time earned to a certain number of hours depending on their business requirements. Employers should ensure that their policies are well-documented and understood by all employees to avoid confusion and potential disputes. Is vacation time treated as wages in Nebraska? Paid vacation time is a fringe benefit legally classified as earned wages. Therefore, once vacation time is earned, it cannot be forfeited. Any accrued vacation time earned is considered wage, and employers must honor it per their established policy. Additionally, if employers offer any PTO, they must be clear about how vacation time is accrued and treated upon an employee’s separation from the company. If the employer’s policy or employee contract states that accrued vacation is paid out upon termination, the employer must comply with this policy. Sick Leave in Nebraska: What Employers Need to Know Nebraska does not have any state law governing sick leave. The state follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guidelines. Employers should be familiar with the FMLA regulations to create policies based on the terms and conditions for accruing, requesting, and using sick leave, including eligibility criteria, and accrual rates. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) The federal law provides eligible employees with job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. All employers with 50 or more employees should offer up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. To be eligible for sick leave under FMLA, employees must meet the following criteria: Employees must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours the previous year. Employees should be working at a location that employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. While FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave, in certain circumstances, such as military caregiver leave, employees may be entitled to up to 26 weeks of time off. An employee can use sick leave time under FMLA for one of the following reasons: Employees may take FMLA leave for their own serious health conditions. Birth or adoption of a child and bonding with the newborn or newly adopted child within one year of the birth or placement. Employees can also use the sick leave time to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness in the line of duty. Family Leave in Nebraska: Maternity, Paternity, and More Nebraska PTO payout laws do not include family leave policies such as maternity or paternity at the state level but follow federal FMLA guidelines. Employees in the state can apply for maternity or paternity leave during significant life events such as the birth or adoption of a child. The FMLA provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for adopting a child or pregnancy. As mentioned above, the same eligibility criteria apply for family leave under FMLA. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is another federal law that employers in the state must abide by. It prohibits discrimination against pregnant employees regarding hiring, firing, promotion, or any other workplace-related event. Nebraska Adoption Leave Another law applicable for family leave is the Nebraska Adoption Leave, which allows employees to take time off for adoption. Under this act, an employee can avail the same leave as under maternity or paternity policies for adopting a child under the age of 9 or adopting a child under the age of 19 with special needs requirements. Under all conditions, maternity or paternity leave is unpaid. Bereavement Leave: Is It Required in Nebraska? There is no statutory requirement in Nebraska for employers to provide bereavement leave. Therefore, it is at the discretion of employers to provide this type of leave, its duration, and whether it is paid or unpaid. Typically, most employers in the state offer bereavement leave of up to 2 days to support employees during difficult times. Jury Duty Leave in Nebraska: What's the Employer's Role? Jury duty is a civic responsibility that requires individuals to serve on a jury and participate in the judicial process. Nebraska mandates that all employers provide employees time off to fulfill their jury duty obligations. Nebraska not only requires employers to provide employees with time off from work to serve on a jury but also to pay them for time spent on jury selection or jury duty. During jury duty leave, employers cannot terminate, demote, or otherwise penalize employees for fulfilling their civic duty as jurors. While employers are required to pay normal wages to employees for the time on jury duty, they can reduce their wages by $35 a day (the amount paid to jurors by the court). Additionally, Nebraska law prohibits employers from requiring employees to use accrued vacation or sick leave for jury duty absences. Military Leave: What Protections Exist in Nebraska? Military leave provisions in the Nebraska state support employees who serve in the armed forces, including National Guard and reserves members. All employers must follow the guidelines of the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) to uphold their legal obligations and demonstrate support for military service members. As per USERRA, members of the National Guard, reserves, or other branches of the armed forces must be provided up to 5 years of unpaid leave for active duty. Also, eligible employees should be provided group healthcare benefits for up to 24 months. Military leave can be used for active duty or military training and drills. Nebraska State Law provides the same level of job protection and benefits as provided under USERRA to the members of the Nebraska National Guard and called for active duty. The Nebraska Family Military Leave Act (NFMLA) The Nebraska Family Military Leave Act is a state-specific law providing additional protections and benefits to employees who are parents or spouses of armed forces or National Guard members. Employers with 15 to 50 employees must provide eligible employees with up to 15 days of unpaid leave for duty requirements. Employers with 50 or more employees must provide eligible employees with up to 30 days of unpaid leave. To be eligible for military leave under NFMLA, employees must fulfill the FMLA criteria, i.e., employed with the current employer for at least 12 months or worked at least 1,250 hours the previous year. Voting Leave: What's Allowed in Nebraska? Nebraska PTO laws mandate that employers provide employees up to 2 hours of paid time off to exercise their right to vote. All eligible employees can take time off work to vote in local, state, and federal elections. However, if the time exceeds 2 hours, employers are not required to pay for time off. Voting leave allows employees who do not have sufficient time outside of working hours to vote. Employers must allow employees to take this leave without penalty or retaliation and cannot require employees to use accrued vacation or sick leave for voting purposes. Holiday Leave in Nebraska: What Employers Can Decide Nebraska observes 12 state holidays, but private employers are not required to provide paid or unpaid holidays to employees. If employers choose to offer holiday leave, they should consider the holidays in the state. Here is a complete list of holidays in Nebraska in 2024: Holiday Observed in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Washington’s Birthday Monday, February 19 3rd Monday in February Arbor Day Friday, April 26 Last Friday in April Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Independence Day Thursday, July 4 July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 1st Monday in September Columbus Day Monday, October 14 2nd Monday in October Veterans Day Monday, November 11 November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 4th Thursday of November Day after Thanksgiving Friday, November 29 Friday after Thanksgiving Christmas Day Wednesday, Dec. 25 December 25 How can Truein help with Paid time off management?
