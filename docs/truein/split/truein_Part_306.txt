As an employer, it is your responsibility to understand California overtime rules as well as federal laws. The state has more generous overtime laws than the federal laws, providing greater protection to employees. In California, all employers should pay employees overtime if they work more than 8 hours a day or more than 40 hours a week. The overtime rate cannot be less than one and a half times the employee’s regular pay rate for hours worked beyond the standard thresholds. In this guide on California OT laws, we explore various aspects of these laws, such as regular pay, how bonuses impact overtime calculations, minimum wage standards, and specific overtime rules for different types of employees.

What happens if an employee works unauthorized overtime? How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion What is the Regular Rate of Pay? To calculate overtime pay accurately, it is essential to understand the concept of a regular rate of pay. The regular rate of pay includes hourly earnings, salaries, piecework earnings, commissions, and certain bonuses. Employers must consider all forms of payments employees receive, not just hourly earnings, for the regular rate of pay calculations. An important consideration is that the regular rate of pay cannot be less than the minimum wage set by the state. In California, there is no standard minimum wage; it varies depending on the size of the employer and is subject to periodic increases. The regular rate of pay is calculated by dividing the total compensation earned in a workweek by the total number of hours worked. This rate must not fall below the applicable minimum wage. Impact of Bonuses on Overtime Calculation Bonuses can have a significant impact on the calculation of overtime pay. CA overtime calculation must include all forms of remuneration that an employee earns. When there are certain types of bonuses, the regular rate of pay changes for the period for which bonuses are received. Understanding the relationship between bonuses and overtime pay is essential for compliance in California. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), reinforced by California labor laws, dictates how bonuses are incorporated into the regular rate of pay to calculate overtime. Therefore, state employers must be aware of the different types of bonuses and how to include them in the regular rate of pay calculation. Types of Bonuses While several kinds of bonuses can exist, in California, all bonuses typically fall into two categories: discretionary and non-discretionary. Discretionary Bonuses : The bonuses at the employer’s full discretion over the fact and amount of payment are discretionary. Such bonuses are not promised or expected but act as a surprise. For instance, if a company offers a holiday bonus based on its profitability, it will be a discretionary bonus. Non-Discretionary Bonuses: All formal bonuses promised to employees, such as bonuses for achieving sales targets, maintaining attendance, or meeting performance goals, are non-discretionary. Non-discretionary bonuses must be included in the regular pay rate when calculating overtime. Calculation of Overtime with Bonuses Only non-discretionary bonuses are included in the regular pay rate when calculating overtime. Let’s understand with an example: An employee earns a base hourly wage of $20 and works 45 hours weekly. The employee also earns a $200 non-discretionary performance bonus for achieving the sales target set by the employer. The regular rate of pay is calculated as follows: Total earnings = (40 hours × $20) + (5 hours × $30) + $200 bonus = $800 + $150 + $200 = $1,150 Regular rate of pay = $1,150 ÷ 45 hours = $25.56 Overtime rate = $25.56 × 1.5 = $38.34 Overtime pay = 5 hours × $38.34 = $191.70 Therefore, the total weekly earnings, including overtime and the bonus, would be $1,150 + $191.70 = $1,341.70. Minimum Wage Rates in California As of January 1, 2024, the minimum wage in California for most employers is $16.00/hour. However, fast-food restaurant employers will have to pay their employees a higher minimum wage of $20.00 per hour from April 1, 2024. The Healthcare Facility employers will also have higher minimum wage rate requirements effective June 1, 2024. Such employers’ higher minimum wage obligation will be $25 per hour. Calculating Overtime for Hourly-paid Employees According to the state of California overtime laws, overtime calculation for hourly-paid employees is straightforward. The overtime is calculated as follows: Employees are paid 1.5 times the regular hourly wage for hours worked over 8 and up to 12 in a day or 40 in a week and for the first 8 hours of the seventh consecutive work day. Employees are paid double the regular wage rate for hours worked over 12 in a day or over 8 on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. Calculating Overtime for Salaried Employees For salaried employees, the regular rate of pay is calculated by dividing the annual salary by 52 to find the weekly wage rate and further dividing the rate by 40 for the regular hourly wage rate. Then, the overtime calculation is the same as for hourly employees based on the regular pay rate. Calculating Overtime for Commission-based Employees The regular pay rate for piecework employees is calculated based on the total earnings divided by the total hours worked in a week. Then, they are paid overtime at 1.5 times the regular wage rate at a flat rate. For commission-based employees, the regular pay rate is first calculated by adding the commissions earned to the hourly earnings and dividing by the number of hours worked. Overtime Calculations for Employees with Multiple Pay Rates If an employee works at two or more different pay rates, the regular rate of pay is the weighted average of the different rates. The weighted average is calculated by dividing the total earnings by the total hours worked. Let’s understand this with an example: Suppose an employee works under two different pay rates during the same week: 30 hours at $20 per hour 20 hours at $25 per hour Total hours worked = 50 hours Step 1 : Calculate total earnings from each rate: $20/hour * 30 hours = $600 $25/hour * 20 hours = $500 Total earnings = $600 + $500 = $1,100 Step 2 : Total hours worked = 50 hours Step 3 : Calculate the weighted average pay rate: Weighted average pay rate = Total earnings / Total hours worked Weighted average pay rate = $1,100 / 50 = $22 per hour Step 4 : Calculate overtime pay: Overtime hours = 50 total hours – 40 standard hours = 10 hours Overtime pay rate = 1.5 * $22/hour = $33/hour Overtime pay = 10 hours * $33/hour = $330 Step 5 : Total Pay for the Week : Regular pay (40 hours * $22/hour) = $880 Overtime pay = $330 Total pay = $880 + $330 = $1,210 Which Employees Are Eligible for Overtime? The California overtime rules cover most employees in California, including hourly, salaried, and commission-based workers. However, eligibility depends on factors such as job duties, compensation, and the nature of the employment relationship. Unless an employee falls into the exempt category of workers and is 18 years or older (or 16/17 years old and legally allowed to work instead of school), they will be eligible for overtime. To be eligible for overtime, here are the minimum requirements: Employees should work more than 8 hours in a single workday Employees working more than 40 hours per week are entitled to overtime. Employees working on the seventh consecutive day of a workweek are entitled to overtime for the first 8 hours worked that day at 1.5 times the regular wage rate. Employees working more than 12 hours per day qualify for double-time pay. Employees working more than 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of a workweek qualify for double time for hours worked beyond 8. Which Employees Are Exempt from Overtime? Certain categories of employees are exempt from the protections of the California overtime laws. It includes the following categories: Executive employees are primarily employed in management roles and direct the work of at least two other employees. Administrative employees whose primary duty involves office or non-manual work directly related to management or general business operations and who exercise discretion and independent judgment. Professional employees require advanced knowledge, predominantly intellectual, and consistent exercise of discretion and judgment. Outside salespersons working away from the employer’s place of business. Computer professionals make at least $27.63 an hour. Agricultural workers Overtime wage laws do not protect exempt employees, but they are generally subject to higher minimum salary requirements and have specific duties that align with their exemption. Unionized Employees and the Bargaining Agreement Unionized employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement are not covered under the California OT laws. However, this is true only if the collective bargaining agreement has different overtime provisions than those outlined in California law. If the agreement has the following three conditions: 1. Definition of work hours, work conditions, and wages 2. The regular wage rate of 30% or higher than the California minimum wage rate 3. Wage rates for overtime hours Then, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement take precedence. If these conditions are not met, unionized employees are considered non-exempt and paid according to California labor laws. Unauthorized Overtime When an employee works overtime that the employer does not authorize, it is termed unauthorized overtime. Whether the overtime hours were approved or not, the California overtime rules are clear. Employers must pay for all hours worked, including unauthorized overtime. The overtime pay cannot be docked as a disciplinary action. Employers must use effective scheduling and strict authorizations to prevent the abuse of overtime rules. Employers' Rights and Responsibilities towards Overtime for Employees Managing overtime effectively is essential for workforce management and a legal requirement under California labor laws. Employers must navigate overtime regulations while upholding their responsibilities to compensate employees fairly according to state and federal standards. Here are the rights and responsibilities of the employers. Keeping Track of Overtime and Compliance Employers are responsible for accurately tracking and recording employee hours, including overtime. Additionally, company policies on overtime must comply with state and federal laws regarding overtime pay and ensure that employees are compensated accurately. Consent/Refusal of Employees California labor laws recognize the workers’ right to refuse overtime unless stated otherwise in the employer’s policy and any applicable collective bargaining agreements. However, some jobs, such as those related to health and safety, require overtime in emergencies. Providing Notice Before Scheduling Overtime While not required by law, employers should provide reasonable notice before scheduling overtime, especially if it is mandatory. It is necessary to foster a positive work culture and allow employees to plan their time and avoid conflicts. Overtime Compensation and Legal Requirements Accurate overtime payment is the responsibility of the employers and is required by law. Failure to do so can result in legal penalties, including back pay, fines, and damages. FAQs Q1. If an employee works unauthorized overtime, must the employer pay for it? Yes, California labor law overtime pay guidelines clearly state that employers are required to pay employees for all hours worked, including unauthorized overtime. However, it is important to note that disciplinary actions against unauthorized overtime should not include withholding pay for hours worked. Q2. Can an employee waive his or her right to overtime compensation? No, employees cannot waive their right to overtime compensation in California. Any agreement that attempts to waive overtime pay is considered void and unenforceable. Q3. What are the employer penalties for retaliation towards an employee’s overtime? Employers who retaliate against employees for asserting their rights can be found guilty of wage theft. Retaliatory actions such as termination, demotion, or reducing an employee’s hours or pay will result in penalties. These penalties include reinstatement, back pay, damages, and civil penalties. Q4. What are the exceptions to general overtime rules? Here are the general exceptions: Exempt executive, administrative, and professional employees who meet specific criteria. Unionized employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that have different overtime rules specified in their agreements. Employees who work alternative workweek schedules that allow for longer daily hours without overtime pay provided the schedule is adopted according to the law. Q5. Can an employer require an employee to work overtime? Yes, employers can require employees to work overtime as they have the right to set work schedules and require overtime as long as they pay the appropriate overtime rates. Q6. What happens if an employee works unauthorized overtime? If an employee works unauthorized overtime, the employer must still pay for the hours worked. However, employers can take disciplinary action against employees who violate policies prohibiting unauthorized overtime. How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management?

In simple terms, employee scheduling involves assigning work shifts to employees within an establishment. While employee scheduling can be simple for some businesses due to the nature of the operations, in the context of a restaurant, this task becomes particularly critical. A schedule for restaurant staff has to account for the fluctuating customer footfall, varying shift requirements, and the need for a diverse set of skills across different times of the day. However, effective scheduling is necessary for restaurants as it helps manage labor costs, optimizes staff productivity, enhances customer service, and ensures that the right number of employees are available at the right time. Types of Restaurant Employee Scheduling Several restaurant employee scheduling models are available. The choice depends on how much automation and efficiency you require for your restaurant operations. Technology-Driven Scheduling You must incorporate modern technology in scheduling. Modern restaurant scheduling software solutions like Truein are designed to facilitate more efficient scheduling through creating a custom schedule or using a previously used schedule. Such a technology-driven scheduling solution can help significantly reduce the time managers spend on creating effective schedules. Truein is designed to be the go-to choice for the restaurant industry, offering features like real-time attendance tracking, automated shift assignments based on predefined rules, and mobile accessibility. It allows managers to effortlessly create, modify, and optimize restaurant staff schedules for accuracy and adaptability to sudden changes in staffing needs. Fixed Schedules Fixed schedules are the most widely used type of scheduling, where employees work the same weekly shifts. This consistency helps employees manage their personal lives better because of predictable work hours such as 7 am—3 pm, 3 pm—11 pm, and 11 pm—7 am. However, the stability of fixed schedules makes it challenging to handle the dynamic changes in customer flow typical in the restaurant industry. Fixed schedules may be appropriate for your establishment if the volume of your business is steady and predictable. Flexible Scheduling Flexible scheduling, also known as open scheduling, allows employees to have varying shifts that they can sometimes choose based on availability. Flexible employee restaurant schedules are advantageous for both employer and employees as restaurant workers can accommodate other commitments such as schooling or second jobs. It helps restaurants manage labor costs more effectively by aligning staff levels closely with business volumes. However, flexible scheduling in the restaurant business requires more communication and coordination to ensure that all shifts are covered. Demand-Driven Scheduling Demand-driven scheduling utilizes expected customer flow forecasting to plan staff shifts accordingly. It is a proactive approach benefiting from historical data and trends to predict busy times and schedule more staff during peak periods while reducing staff during slower times. This type of scheduling is highly efficient in managing labor costs and can improve customer service by ensuring adequate staffing when needed. Rotating Shifts Rotating shifts involves cycling employees through different shifts every week. This scheduling form ensures everyone shares the burden of less desirable work hours, like late nights or early mornings. In the hospitality industry, rotating shifts can help keep the scheduling fair and equitable among staff, potentially increasing job satisfaction and reducing turnover. Split Shifts As seen in the restaurant industry, split shifts involve employees working a set of hours during the day, taking a break, and returning for another set of hours. For example, employees can work from 11 am to 3 pm, take a break, and return from 8 pm to 12 am. This type of schedule can be beneficial in bridging gaps during mid-day slow footfall and then covering the busy evening rush. Seasonal Scheduling Seasonal scheduling is appropriate for establishments where footfall is significantly affected seasonally, such as restaurants in tourist areas or those impacted by seasonal events. This type of scheduling requires strategic planning and recruitment to scale up operations during busy months and scale down in the off-season. Restaurants in tourist spots use seasonal scheduling to ensure optimal staff utilization and service level throughout the year. Steps to Make a Restaurant Schedule for Employees Creating a well-organized restaurant schedule is more than just a routine administrative task. Here are a few practical steps to streamline your scheduling process, ensuring you have the right staff at the right time, minimize labor costs, and boost team morale. 1. Choose a Good Restaurant Scheduling Software and Create Your Restaurant Schedule Template The first step is to choose a robust employee scheduling software for restaurants that can help you use technology for your business operations. A good scheduling tool like Truein offers features that allow easy creation and modification of schedules, real-time communication capabilities, and integration with other systems such as payroll and HR. It makes the scheduling process efficient by minimizing human errors. To optimize the scheduling process, create a restaurant schedule template that works for you and can be used repeatedly. 2. Pay Attention to Business Demands and Employee Strength Understanding the ebb and flow of your business and recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of your workers is essential for effective scheduling. When you anticipate busy periods and customer demands, you can match them with appropriate employee skills, roles, and performance. Matching the right person to the right shift is necessary to ensure your team is strong when your restaurant is busiest. 3. Setting Up Shifts and Duties You must clearly define the shift structure, including the length of shifts, the number of staff needed per shift, and the specific roles required during the shifts. Duties should be assigned based on the employee’s skills and the restaurant’s operational needs. 4. Schedule Busy Shifts First The priority of the scheduling should be to cover peak times such as lunch, dinner, weekends, or special occasions. By prioritizing scheduling for busy shifts, you can guarantee that the best workers are available during the most needed hours. 5. Assign Shifts According to Availability You cannot have an effective schedule if you are not aware of the availability of the workers. Collect and consider employee availability before assigning shifts to avoid conflicts and last-minute changes. 6. Handle Changes in Shifts Your employees must be aware of the process for handling shift changes. This is another aspect of restaurant employee scheduling that can be well handled by using software that effectively informs workers about shift changes. You can establish a shift swap system among employees or have on-call staff for unexpected needs. 7. Avoid Back-to-Back Shifts You don’t want cranky staff handling your customers. Avoid scheduling employees for consecutive closing and opening shifts to prevent employee burnout and maintain employee well-being and productivity. 8. Maintain Communications Regarding the Schedule Effective communication is an integral part of restaurant employee scheduling. All your employees should have access to their schedules well in advance, and any changes should be communicated promptly. 9. Enhance Flexibility in Shift Changes When Needed Shift schedule flexibility leads to higher employee satisfaction and retention. Allowing for shift changes to accommodate personal emergencies or requests fosters a supportive workplace culture. 10. Make the Schedule Easy to Access Ultimately, you must ensure that your perfectly crafted shift schedules are easily accessible to all employees. Truein offers a mobile app that allows employees to check their schedules from anywhere at any time. This accessibility reduces confusion and missed shifts, ensuring smooth operations. Best Practices and Tips for Restaurant Scheduling Here, we discuss strategies and insights to help in enhancing employee satisfaction and operational efficiency through scheduling. Whether you’re looking to fine-tune your current practices or overhaul your scheduling approach entirely, here are the best practices. 1. Cross-train employees Restaurants need specific skills and roles for each shift. However, if you cross-train your employees, you’ll be prepared for the days when you are understaffed. For example, a busy weekend evening might require more servers, and your cleaning staff can take on the role if they are cross-trained. 2. Plan and honor time off requests Ensure that your employees and new hires know the schedule requirements and how much time they are expected to work. Explain to them the number of consecutive working days, the duration of shifts, and their roles’ physical and mental demands. Honor the time off requests to ensure your workers know you care for them. Ensuring employees have adequate time off is crucial for maintaining a healthy and motivated workforce. 3. Plan for holidays Create a holiday time off policy to ensure that your staff is available at certain times of the year, such as holidays or local festivals. To keep them motivated, consider offering them time and a half or double pay for working during the holiday season. Additionally, you can schedule time off shortly after the holiday rush to help them rest after working hard. 4. Analyze Previous Schedules Regularly reviewing feedback on previous schedules can provide valuable insights. The data can help you decide what works and what doesn’t for your restaurant, discover any blind spots in your scheduling process, and learn from past schedules to make future scheduling more effective. 5. Gather feedback from employees . Ultimately, your employees can provide valuable insights about the sore points of the scheduling process. Establish open communication channels to encourage employees to provide honest feedback on the scheduling process. Factors to Consider When Creating Schedules When creating a schedule for your restaurant employees, you have to consider some crucial things. Here are the factors to ensure that your scheduling optimizes workforce management, reduces turnover, and complies with applicable labor laws. Compliance with labor laws and regulations Restaurants require more dynamic scheduling than most businesses, which makes them susceptible to compliance issues. Adhering to labor laws and regulations, including regulations on minimum wage, overtime, working hours, and mandatory breaks, is essential. Peak hours and busy periods Maintaining effective employee restaurant schedules without identifying peak hours and busy periods will be challenging. You must analyze sales data, customer traffic patterns, and event calendars to anticipate peak hours and busy periods. Employee availability and preferences It is important to consider when employees are available to ensure they are not turning down shifts or unhappy at work. If your schedules consider their preferred working hours, it can affect morale and reduce turnover. You will have a more engaged workforce, and they will perform better if they work shifts that suit their personal lives. Benefits and Challenges of Restaurant Scheduling Restaurant scheduling is a critical task that directly impacts both operational success and workplace atmosphere. However, the benefit of a restaurant’s efficiency and employee satisfaction comes with some hurdles that can complicate achieving these benefits. Here are the key advantages of restaurant employee scheduling and the common challenges that can arise as well. Advantages of restaurant employee scheduling: Optimized labor costs as restaurant owners can align staff needs with customer demand. Improved customer service due to adequate staffing during peak times without compromising service speed and quality. Fair and flexible scheduling results in more job satisfaction, reduced turnover, and improved morale. Streamlined scheduling improves overall restaurant operational efficiency by matching the right staff with the right skills to the right role and shift. Challenges of restaurant scheduling: Accommodating employee preferences with the demands of scheduling is complicated and time-consuming. Even with the best tools, anticipating customer flow can be difficult, making it challenging to schedule the correct number of employees for peak hours. Shift changes, illness, and emergencies result in last-minute changes that can disrupt even the most carefully planned schedules.
