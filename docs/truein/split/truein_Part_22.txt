How Advanced Workforce Management Solutions Can Transform Hospitality Operations in the Middle East? August 29, 2024 The Middle East is diversifying itself into a crucial component of the global economy by shifting its reliance on the oil and chemical industry. In this approach, the countries in the region are transforming into tourist destinations and other sectors as part of their economic diversification strategy. This is impacting the hospitality industry the most. From luxury resorts in Dubai to cultural heritage sites in Saudi Arabia, the industry has become a cornerstone of tourism and economic development. However, with this growth comes the challenge of managing an increasingly complex and diverse workforce. Efficient workforce management is crucial in the hospitality industry. When customer satisfaction and operational excellence are paramount for your business success, you must ensure processes are in place to ensure smooth operations. This is why workforce management for hospitality is critical. Proper hospitality workforce management is the difference between a thriving establishment and one that needs help to meet guest expectations. Here, we explore how workforce management solutions in the hospitality industry give the ability to schedule staff, manage resources, and optimize productivity effectively. Table of Contents The Current State of Workforce Management in Middle Eastern Hospitality Why should one consider advanced workforce management solutions? Optimized Workforce Scheduling in Operations Management Integration with Existing Systems Benefits of smooth data integration and system interoperability Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity Better Employee Satisfaction and Retention Improved Resource Allocation Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management Data-Driven Insights Implementing Advanced Workforce Management Solutions 1. Select an appropriate workforce management solution based on: 2. Specialised Workforce Management Software for Hospitality 3. Training and Support Needs 4. Cost Considerations 5. Customization and Scalability 6. Monitoring and Evaluation Future Trends in Workforce Management for Hospitality Remote and Flexible Work Trends How does Truein help with Hospitality Workforce Management in the Middle East? Conclusion The Current State of Workforce Management in Middle Eastern Hospitality The hospitality industry in the Middle East is highly dynamic with such a high influx of foreigners. The workforce operations and scheduling also have some unique challenges in the sector due to cultural differences. These workforce scheduling in operations management challenges are further compounded by the industry’s inherent characteristics, such as 24/7 operations, seasonal fluctuations, and the need for diverse skill sets. Another pressing issue of hospitality workforce management in the Middle East is the high turnover rate. This is particularly challenging as most of the hospitality sector workforce is comprised of ex-pats. In the absence of enough local workforce, turnover can be a crippling factor for any hospitality establishment. According to a study by TFG Management , the average turnover rate in the Middle East cities like Dubai’s hospitality sector is around 30%. This attrition rate is significantly higher than the global average. Without immaculate workforce management for hospitality in the region, restaurants and hotels will face a constant churn of employees. This will pressure HR departments to recruit, train, and integrate new staff members continuously. However, these are only some of the factors posing workforce management challenges in the Middle Eastern hospitality sector. Some other factors include: Seasonal demand fluctuations High turnover rate Complex shift patterns and scheduling requirements Compliance with labor laws and regulations Managing a diverse, multicultural workforce Balancing cost control with service quality Another distinguishing factor of workforce management in the Middle East is the cultural and regulatory factors. For instance, the region’s unique workweek structure, with many countries observing Friday and Saturday as the weekend and religious observances such as Ramadan, necessitate adjustments in the work schedules and staffing levels. Additionally, the regulatory compliance requirements for each country in the Middle East can vary significantly. For example, the United Arab Emirates recently introduced new labor laws to improve work-life balance and employee rights. Such changes require hospitality businesses in the region to be agile and responsive in their workforce management practices. Why should one consider advanced workforce management solutions? Given the unique challenges faced in restaurant workforce management in the Middle East, it’s a no-brainer that only advanced workforce management solutions can overcome these challenges. There are several reasons to opt for such a workforce management solution: Optimized Workforce Scheduling in Operations Management Modern scheduling tools such as Truein can enhance operational effectiveness. These tools achieve this optimization by significantly automating the creation of complex schedules, considering factors such as employee skills, availability, and local labor laws. Due to their agile design and customizable features, such scheduling tools provide the flexibility to adjust schedules quickly in response to unexpected changes in demand or staff availability. For instance, according to Captera, businesses implementing modern workforce management solutions reduce the time spent on scheduling by 80% and improve labor cost management. Advanced workforce management software for hospitality differs from traditional hospitality management systems in several ways: It focuses specifically on employee management It provides deeper insights into workforce productivity and performance. These solutions can often integrate with existing hospitality management systems They create an ecosystem of a more comprehensive operational overview. Interestingly, many of these solutions are based on the core principles of manufacturing scheduling, where lean management and just-in-time scheduling are critical. Integration with Existing Systems Modularity and compatibility are other advantages of modern workforce management solutions. It gives them the ability to integrate seamlessly with other business systems. Modern workforce management solutions like Truein can seamlessly integrate with payroll systems, ensuring accurate and timely wage calculations. It reduces errors and improves employee satisfaction. They also integrate with existing HR systems, aiding onboarding, training, and performance management processes. Furthermore, their operational system integration provides real-time data on business needs, allowing for more responsive workforce management. Benefits of smooth data integration and system interoperability Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity By automating routine tasks and providing data-driven insights, workforce management solutions can significantly boost operational efficiency. When employees and managers don’t have to log in time and attendance data manually, productivity can be improved considerably. Better Employee Satisfaction and Retention With effective workforce management solutions, hospitality establishments can improve employee satisfaction. For instance, self-service portals for shift swapping and time-off requests, mobile apps for easy access to schedules and communication, and fair and transparent scheduling practices can lead to higher job satisfaction and potentially reduce the high turnover rates. Improved Resource Allocation Advanced solutions provide managers with a detailed insight into labor costs and productivity. This allows managers in the industry to allocate resources more effectively, leading to significant cost savings without compromising service quality. Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management With built-in compliance and safety check features, such hospitality workforce management solutions help businesses comply with the regulatory and labor requirements in the Middle East. Data-Driven Insights One of the most valuable aspects of advanced workforce management solutions is their ability to provide actionable insights based on data analysis. The hospitality industry can significantly benefit from such data as it can be used for strategic decisions about staffing levels, training needs, and operational improvements. Implementing Advanced Workforce Management Solutions Planning the implementation of advanced workforce management solutions is essential. A botched-up implementation can curtail operations and derail schedules. Follow through these steps for effective implementation: 1. Select an appropriate workforce management solution based on: Scalability to accommodate future growth of your restaurant or hotel Compatibility with existing HR and payroll systems Customization options to meet the specific needs of your business User-friendliness for both managers and employees Robust reporting and analytics capabilities Conduct a thorough audit of current systems and processes to ensure that the workforce management software for the hospitality you are considering is compatible with existing systems. It will require the assistance of IT teams early in the planning process. Discuss the need for data migration and ensure data integrity. Additionally, a phased implementation of the workforce management solution should be considered to minimize disruption. If you are facing challenges like potential resistance from employees, try to: Communicate clearly and frequently about the reasons for change and expected benefits Involve employees in the implementation process to address their concerns Provide comprehensive training and support 2. Specialised Workforce Management Software for Hospitality Depending on your business model and requirements, you might require bespoke specialized workforce management software. This will require considering features such as: Flexible scheduling tools that can handle complex shift patterns Real-time time and attendance tracking Mobile accessibility for on-the-go management and employee self-service Advanced integration capabilities Compliance management features tailored to Middle Eastern labor laws Customized workforce management solutions offer several advantages for various hospitality settings. For instance, you can integrate it with room management systems to align staffing with occupancy rates. For several reasons, the hospitality industry is moving towards cloud-based solutions over on-premises solutions. While the cloud-based solutions have ongoing subscription fees, they are far more agile and customizable, which is only possible with on-premises solutions with custom development. You don’t have to manage any IT infrastructure as setup and data are in cloud storage. It makes cloud-based workforce management solutions far more scalable and flexible. However, cloud-based solutions’ data security and compliance needs are more complex. 3. Training and Support Needs Once you select an advanced workforce management solution for your establishment, create a comprehensive staff training program. Focus on role-specific training for managers, supervisors, and employees with hands-on practice sessions. Create a help desk that supports online knowledge bases and user forums. Feedback from employees at all levels must be encouraged to foster a culture of ongoing improvement and adaptability. 4. Cost Considerations Implementing advanced workforce management solutions can be a costly affair. However, in the long run, the investment is recovered in high employee retention and customer satisfaction. The cost involved in specialized hospitality workforce management software typically includes: Initial licensing or subscription costs Implementation and integration expenses Training and change management costs Ongoing support and maintenance fees When considering overall cost, do not just decide on face value but the return on investment (ROI) and long-term advantages. Consider labor cost savings through optimized scheduling and reduced administrative time for managers. Also, forecast the benefits of improved employee retention and reduced turnover costs. Also, enhanced customer satisfaction will lead to increased revenue. 5. Customization and Scalability Work closely with vendors if you need to tailor the solution to your unique operational requirements. Hotels can need customization, such as developing custom reports or dashboards for specific management needs. Customization can also be required to integrate with local systems or processes unique to the Middle East market. Whatever approach you take, there must be scope for scalability. Choose a solution that can easily accommodate increasing employees and locations. Prefer software vendors with a track record of continuous product development and improvement. It is better to opt for solutions that support modular add-ons for future expansion of capabilities. 6. Monitoring and Evaluation You must set clear milestones and KPIs for the implementation process to evaluate progress and monitor benefits. Regularly review the implementation progress against these benchmarks. It is better to use project management tools to keep implementation on track. To measure system effectiveness and efficiency: Monitor key metrics such as labor cost percentage and time to create schedules Compare pre- and post-implementation data to quantify improvements Use built-in analytics tools to identify areas of improvements That is not all; you will also need to make continuous adjustments to the implementation based on system performance. Also, regular surveys or focus groups should be conducted with employees and managers for feedback on needed improvements. Future Trends in Workforce Management for Hospitality Several emerging technologies will likely shape the future of workforce management in the Middle East hospitality sector. Just like every other sector, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning are making a headway into the industry. Establishments use such technologies for more accurate demand forecasting and innovative scheduling algorithms. For example, AI could analyze historical data, weather forecasts, and local events to predict staffing needs with unprecedented accuracy. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices such as smart meters, trackers, and smart room sensors could provide real-time data on guest movements and preferences. For instance, smart room sensors could alert housekeeping when a room is vacated, optimizing cleaning schedules. Remote and Flexible Work Trends There is also a shift towards remote work instead of traditionally on-site presence in the industry. Certain positions, such as reservations or customer service, may adopt hybrid models, combining on-site and remote work. How does Truein help with Hospitality Workforce Management in the Middle East?
