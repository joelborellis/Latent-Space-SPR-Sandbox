For any organization or business, employees are the greatest assets. The challenges and nuances of efficient employee scheduling must be addressed to keep them happy and engaged at work. There is much to deal with scheduling needs, leave and time-off requests, worker demands, and payroll requirements. When juggling many responsibilities, common employee scheduling problems are likely to occur. But as a manager, it is your responsibility to make it possible for workers to maintain a balanced work schedule. The staff scheduling problem is much more common for organizations still managing everything manually. According to market research , manual scheduling is the most common reason for scheduling problems, errors, and employee dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the study found: 20% of HR managers’ time is wasted creating work schedules 140 hours are lost annually on manual employee scheduling 174% more turnover occurs due to errors from manual schedule creation It is evident that digitization of employee scheduling is mandatory now; there are some common employee scheduling problems you must be familiar with. Here we are listing some commonly occurring scheduling problems and their solutions. Table of Contents 1. Not utilizing modern technology 2. Shortage of employees 3. Unequal shift distribution 4. Last-minute employee absences 5. Overscheduling employees 6. Vacations and time off Conclusion 1. Not utilizing modern technology Pen and paper are no longer viable for managing the workforce. Even if you have a small business to operate, manual employee scheduling is prone to issues and miscommunication. It requires a lot of following up, back-and-forth calls, and messages which is incredibly time-consuming and inefficient. There exist powerful and easy-to-use employee scheduling software like Truein that you can deploy to eradicate manual scheduling issues and streamline communication.

Shortage of employees An employee scheduling problem will likely occur if your organization has a staff shortage. To keep things running smoothly, you need enough employees to cover all the shifts and also cover for employees who call in sick or are on vacation. Understaffed operations result in an overworked and unsatisfied workforce and poor customer service. The solution to the problem is to hire more workers or optimize the existing workforce. The first option is relatively straightforward; you can fill the gap in the shifts by hiring full-time or part-time employees. However, it’s an additional cost, and if the requirement is temporary, it can result in overstaffing later. Optimizing the workforce with software like Truein can solve this issue. You can automate processes, maintain compliance, and always have real-time data of available workers. This will empower you to deal with staff shortages. 3. Unequal shift distribution Playing favorites when employee scheduling might not be on your mind, but subconsciously you might pick certain workers for tasks you think best match their skills. However, putting them in a particular shift every time will send the wrong message. Other workers will feel that you are favoring some workers over others. Again, automated employee scheduling software can help avoid such a staff scheduling problem. It can ensure that no employee gets a ‘good’ shift every time, and similarly, no worker is stuck with a ‘bad’ shift. Furthermore, employee scheduling software can help you comply with federal, state, and local labor laws. Such optimization ensures that there is never unequal shift distribution. 4. Last-minute employee absences Life is unpredictable, and no matter how well planned your shift schedule is, personal problems can get in the way of work anytime. Sick kids, illnesses, accidents, or unforeseen obstacles can result in last-minute employee absences. When such an event occurs, the worse thing is to panic. The solution here is to identify the workers who can fill the shift. You can quickly look through Truein’s employee roster to find which employees are scheduled to work in that particular shift or before. You can ask them if they can put in extra hours (overtime), suggest days off, or shorten the shifts for the rest of the days instead of covering for the absent worker. If no such employee is available, you can contact off-duty workers regarding shift change. 5. Overscheduling employees The efficiency of the workforce depends on how well rested the workers are. If you expect 100% efficiency from them, you have to ensure that you are not overscheduling employees. Federal and state regulations make it mandatory that employees must be given eight hours between shifts; it is not an application for all employees, such as temporary staff. Also, at times managers scrunch shifts together accidentally. In the real world, employees have to commute to and from work, take care of chores at home, and catch up with friends and family. This leaves them with less-than-optimal time to take rest if their shifts are scheduled for more than 8 hours. The solution to this common employee scheduling problem is maintaining at least 12 hours gap between shifts. If it’s not possible in your organization to keep a difference of 12 hours, try to arrange staff scheduling so that workers get two days off together. The extended period will allow them to decrease their sleep deficit. 6. Vacations and time off Every worker deserves time off from work to balance work and personal life. When too focused on productivity, revenue and profits, it is easy to not care for employees’ vacation time or time off. All employees must be given this incentive. To cover for the employees who take time off, you can cross-train the workers such there is always staff available to take responsibility in the absence of other employees. You can also incentivize employees to cover for other workers by offering bonuses, increased pay rates, or more time off. Conclusion It may not be possible to avoid employee scheduling problems altogether, but they can be managed. It all depends on how effectively you manage your workforce. This guide will help you avoid the most common staff scheduling problems. We recommend Truein for employee scheduling. You can create, change, and publish schedules almost instantly. No longer excel sheets or additional hardware is needed; you can deploy the best employee scheduling solution with this cloud-based time and attendance software .

How To Create A Staff Deployment Plan? July 24, 2024 A staff deployment plan differs in every organization depending on the requirement and other factors. Most managers use staffing deployment plans only to identify the headcount additions and reductions when much more can be achieved. If you are creating a staff deployment plan, you should know what questions to ask to clearly understand the current state of the workforce, the desired future state, and how to get there. In this article, we’ll explore how managers can create a staff deployment plan best suited for your business’s particular needs. Table of Contents What is a staff deployment plan? Benefits of the employee deployment plan 1. It saves time 2. No worry of shortage of employees or no employees for a particular task 3. Work gets completed on time How to create a staff deployment plan 1. Evaluate the staffing goals 2. Assign roles to the employees 3. Provide training to employees for the work 4. Monitor performance Conclusion What is a staff deployment plan? A staff deployment plan is a process that provides flexible multi-channel workforce forecasting. With effective staff deployment planning, companies can ensure that there is an accurate representation of work and employees and workload is evenly distributed and meets the budgetary goals. A staff deployment plan is how you can decide the best possible employee schedule . It also fully leverages the employee skillsets to balance the workload and gives an optimized shift schedule by accounting for variables such as payroll requirements, employee availabilities, budgetary objectives, company requirements, and other policies. With workforce deployment, an organization can align the company’s goals, customers’ expectations, and the employees’ career needs. A staff deployment plan transforms the scheduling process from a necessary, tedious, and clerical chore into a cost-effective, analytical, and proactive business management process. Benefits of the employee deployment plan While managers will need to spend significant time crafting a quality staff deployment plan, it is still worth the investment of resources. It is because the outcome offers many advantages. Here are the key benefits of an employee deployment plan: 1. It saves time A deployment plan is not only for scheduling optimization but also provides employees with a clear description of what they need to do. It is also a great document to assist in onboarding new hires as they are less likely to commit mistakes at work. It saves time as managers and supervisors don’t have to spend time making corrections or altering the shift schedules. Deployment plans are highly effective in ensuring that employees work on tasks correctly. HR managers are free from repeated tasks of adjusting shift schedules to ensure high productivity. They can invest the time saved in making crucial business operation decisions that directly contribute to revenues and profits. 2. No worry of shortage of employees or no employees for a particular task When you utilize software solutions like Truein to keep track of the workers, you are in a better position to schedule shifts, distribute workload, and keep productivity high at all times. Understaffing or overstaffing are both problematic for a company. If you regularly struggle with a shortage of employees, not only will the production levels be hurt, but you will also face difficulties on other fronts. Workers will be overworked if there is a shortage, and you might be forced to give tasks to employees who are not appropriately skilled to handle them. Staff deployment plans free you from such issues. You can forecast if there will be an increase in demand for labor or workers ahead. 3. Work gets completed on time With the correct number of shift workers, you can ensure that the work is done on time. Staff deployment plans can inform about the gap in the skillset in the workforce such that you can train employees accordingly. Cross-training employees is an effective way to make sure you always have workers available to substitute for other workers. How to create a staff deployment plan 1. Evaluate the staffing goals Like any other planning task, the first step in developing a staff deployment plan is to evaluate the organization’s needs. You have to recognize the targets you want to achieve and write them down such that employees can work towards them. HR managers are responsible for evaluating the goals and identifying the support needed to meet those goals. When you clearly understand the staff deployment plan requirements, you can better align departmental goals with the organization’s goals. For this step, you must reach other leaders to understand their expectations from the departments for the coming year or new strategic initiatives they plan to undertake that will require staffing adjustments. Here are some critical questions that can help you identify significant goals: What primary strategic or tactical goals the company wants to implement for the upcoming year? How will HR managers support these goals? What goals do you need to set for your team such that your team is aligned with the company’s goal? What staffing changes will need to be worked on to ensure enough workforce to make these goals possible? How will you ensure that other departments support each other to achieve the end goals? 2. Assign roles to the employees After you identify the goals correctly, the next step is to assign roles to the employees. First, evaluate the current staffing state and create an inventory of the skillset at play. The staff deployment plan must support future goals by availing the right talent at the right time. To effectively assign roles to employees, you will need information like current staff, contingency workers, and other contractual staff available to fill in the gaps. In addition, you must know about their skillsets and the role they perform within the company. Manually it is impossible to keep track of all this information which is why you need automated tools like Truein. Truein is a complete employee time and attendance system that offers shift scheduling solutions . It is a cloud-based, AI-powered face recognition attendance system that allows managers and supervisors to create and share shift schedules with workers. It will enable workers to record their attendance and confirm their availability for shift directly from the Truein app on their smartphones. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account 3. Provide training to employees for the work If you find a skill gap after listing goals and matching them against the available workforce inventory, you need to plan ways to bridge the gap. Whether you find inadequate staffing, lack of expertise, or simply wrong employees being put in the wrong place, you can fix the issues by providing training to employees. Analysis of the workforce will help you identify the deficiencies in the current state of employees. It is your responsibility as an HR manager to address the skill deficiencies that can hinder the success of the goals outlined in the staff deployment plan. Please do not view the skill gap as a weakness of the current teams but rather as an opportunity to help employees evolve in their roles to better align with future organizational goals. 4. Monitor performance Once you have successfully decided the end goals of the staff deployment plan, created shift schedules, and matched workers with the right skills with the tasks, the last phase is to monitor the workers’ performance. Your staff deployment plan must monitor the end-state and interim staffing. You must ensure that employees are not struggling with performance and can complete tasks on time. If there is a skill gap, consider retraining the employees whenever required. Any successful deployment plan must outline when the staff is needed, at what time, and location. It should also differentiate full-time versus contractual staff and identify the critical roles based on the skill set. Conclusion A staff deployment plan is one of the essential components of workforce planning. It is the first step an organization can take towards evolving its existence and helping employees adapt to the changing needs of the business. We hope this guide will provide you with enough insights to help you create an effective staff deployment plan that considers more than the headcount and includes additional complexities such as skill sets, end goals, and long-term strategic plans.

Why Automatic Scheduling Is Better Than Regular Scheduling? July 24, 2024 At any company, scheduling employees and their tasks are one of HR managers’ core responsibilities. It is a crucial management function that ensures enough workers are available to keep the business operations running. Shift scheduling is essential but time-consuming and tedious when the number of workers to manage is high. Many companies are adopting automatic scheduling tools to simplify the process, but many employers are still reluctant to use them. Change is hard. However, it is essential for business growth and adaptation. Today, optimizing business operations for efficiency to increase productivity and beat the competition is vital. An automated scheduling system can result in a productivity boost as it frees up a lot of time for HR managers to focus on other activities related to operations management and employee engagement. This article will explore the importance and benefits of automatic scheduling for a company. But, before we discuss the benefits of automated scheduling for a business, it is helpful to understand manual scheduling and where it is lacking. Table of Contents What is manual scheduling? What is automated scheduling? 4 benefits of automated scheduling 1. Saves time 2. Reduces overtime spending 3. Track working employees easily 4. More accurate Why is automatic scheduling better than manual scheduling? How can Truein help you with automated scheduling? Conclusion What is manual scheduling? Manual scheduling is when supervisors and managers have to manage the schedule of workers through timesheets. It is a prevalent practice at most manufacturing and construction companies. As manual scheduling gives the managers complete control over who, when, and where an employee is scheduled, it allows for micromanaging almost all aspects of an employee’s work shift. However, this type of schedule is not sustainable as it can take hours or even days depending on the number of employees to be scheduled. Furthermore, manual scheduling creates layers of abstraction that make it challenging to identify favoritism by managers. For instance, as managers ultimately control the shift schedule, they can easily allot preferred shifts to some employees irrespective of whether the assignment fits them. They can also discriminate between the distribution of hours of work, days off, shift rotations , and holidays. With an automatic employee schedule, the entire shift schedule data can be centralized such that no one manager is in control. What is automated scheduling? Automatic scheduling can have a revolutionary effect on employee scheduling and management. Most automatic schedule maker tools consider your organization’s policies, holidays, weekly off, and staff availability to come up with the best times and people to schedule shifts. The real benefit of an automatic employee schedule lies in its ability to assist HR managers in creating transparent shifts and eliminate favoritism or discrimination. Automated scheduling allows you to put labor where labor is needed with extreme efficiency without overworking employees. An automatic shift schedule is beneficial not only for the company but for employees as well. These systems are flexible and can help improve employee quality of life issues. These tools can allow multiple shift availabilities so employees can work without burnout . As the workload will be evenly distributed among employees, there will be better work-life balance. For HR managers, such tools provide a high degree of automation. As a manager, you can create and fix a schedule taking a fraction of the time compared to manual scheduling. Also, the program will keep you on track even if you are on leave for a day or two. 4 benefits of automated scheduling With automatic scheduling, you can achieve an extremely balanced work schedule for workers and create an automated system that can operate independently. An automatic schedule maker offers more than time-saving and labor management . Here are some essential benefits of automated scheduling. 1. Saves time When HR managers don’t have to sit through a long list of data to find the right employees for a particular shift, they can create a work schedule much more efficiently. Time-saving is one of the most significant benefits of adopting automatic scheduling in your company. The time thus saved by using shift scheduling tools like Truein can then be focused on more critical tasks like promoting your business and making future goals. 2. Reduces overtime spending Overtime spending can have a dramatic impact on a business’s bottom line. If not kept under check, you can lose a substantial portion of your revenue in paying overtime wages. You can configure the system with an auto-scheduler to consider certain overtime limits. It is how you can control overtime spending and eliminate any malpractices, such as unnecessary work hours and frequent overtime shifts. 3. Track working employees easily Often there is a discrepancy between planned or scheduled tasks and actual tasks performed by the employees when there is no way to track their performance. It happens with on-site employees more often. With automated scheduling, it is possible to create an accurate log of exactly what work is being performed and when. An automatic shift scheduler can record the time worked by the employees at the location. This allows HR managers to match the schedule with actuals, tracking down any discrepancy or deviation in employee performance. Managers can quickly generate reports comparing the program with actual tasks and tracking discrepancies or deviations. 4. More accurate Unsurprisingly, an auto-schedule maker is much more accurate than manual scheduling. Human error is possible when you keep timesheets to track employees and create schedules. Automatic scheduling can auto-track data such as employee availability, schedule shift timing, weekly off, etc., to more accurately schedule shifts, ensuring that the right person is available for the job at the right time. It saves time and cost otherwise wasted if shifts are not correctly scheduled. It can lead to poor productivity and loss of revenue. Also, faulty schedules can put the same workers to work affecting their performance and health. Why is automatic scheduling better than manual scheduling? Automatic scheduling saves the labor wasted on manual scheduling to a great extent as managers can invest the resources saved by adopting automated scheduling on the tasks that can increase sales, improve customer interaction, and result in cost savings. Manual scheduling is highly limited in flexibility when a large workforce is involved. With an automated schedule maker, a large workforce can be much more easily managed, ensuring better labor distribution, lower cost, happier employees, and better customer experience. How can Truein help you with automated scheduling? Truein is a cloud-based shift scheduling and attendance software. It is an AI-powered face recognition attendance software that offers capabilities to automate attendance management and leave management.
