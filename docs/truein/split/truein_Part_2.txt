Helping businesses to bring transparency and control in Attendance & Timesheets process to improve workforce utilization and plug revenue leakages. Designed in-depth for Contract & Distributed staff use cases. Trusted by 500+ Customers Globally The start of things Founder Ankit Tanna and Jigar Pujara started Truein to address the pain areas in Time & Attendance management for contract and remotely deployed staff. In the course of his previous venture, Ankit happened to meet several of his customers and their Admin and HR leaders. During discussions, he learned about the pain areas in time and attendance management for contract and remotely deployed staff. As most of these staff were temporary and frequently changing, one common problem was registering them for attendance. Sometimes the staff directly reported at the worksite, and admins had to manually sync records across locations. He also noticed a lot of manual steps involved in Timesheets calculations for payroll. It was tedious and error-prone. Existing attendance solutions were not centralized and foolproof. The problem multifolds when the staff is distributed across customer sites with different policies for each of these sites. These problems directly impacted workforce productivity and also caused revenue leakages. Journey to Solution We embarked on this journey to fix the several issues for Contract and Distributed workforce. We built Truein, a nextgen Time and Attendance solution for organizations with a low and medium skilled workforce. The solution leverages face recognition and AI technologies. Truein brings transparency and control in the Time and Attendance process. It also helps to optimize workforce utilization and plug revenue leakages. 25 Countries 500+ Customers 500,000+ Users Truein is robust, reliable, and works as promised. I have implemented Truein in my previous and current companies. It's the best and most cost-effective solution.

Payroll-ready Reports Automated timesheets with final calculations for payroll processing. Our Awards and Achievements Our founders had over 10 years of tech experience in India, U.S.A and Singapore and they saw a big gap in the current visitor management system. They visited large multinationals who totally disappointed them right at the gate. From tedious and manual check-in processes to unimpressive front-end, they had not evolved in a long time. There definitely existed a problem and we were all set to solve in the most futuristic way. Our first flagship product was Truein visitor management system. We introduced AI-based face-recognition systems for the first time to indian companies and the response was overwhelming. We had cracked the code at two levels – the system was secure and super fast. It was a ‘wow at first sight’. In no time, we had entered the premises and hearts of some of the biggest organizations. However, we couldn’t stop at this. We kept evolving by keeping our ears to the ground. We listened intently to our customers and helped them solve challenges with new features. Soon enough we had 100+ features in our visitor management app. We were all set to go a step further and we used our proprietary technology to launch Truein attendance, which also had 30+ features. With new applications for contract staff, remote workers and covid-safety, we are at the cutting-edge of innovation.

How does face attendance win over other biometric systems? June 21, 2024 Traditionally companies have used the thumb-based attendance system, which served as a good substitute to card-based systems. Neither of them were perfect and faced many setbacks on reliability and security. Attendance with face recognition has gained attention in recent years. While large companies have been quick to upgrade to face recognition attendance systems, many mid-sized organizations are still working with older technologies. Is it worthwhile to upgrade to face id attendance systems? Let’s evaluate the biometric systems objectively. Table of Contents How face recognition attendance system works? Why is face attendance better than thumb-based or fingerprint systems? Frequently asked questions: 1. Which biometric attendance system is more reliable and accurate? 2. Which biometric attendance system is more affordable? Make an informed decision How face recognition attendance system works? The system stores a database of faces. A screen, usually a mobile or tablet in case of Truein, is placed at the entrance and employees have to simply walk towards it. A match is triggered with the database and attendance is captured within a second. Systems like Truein are benchmarked with the eye so no amount of change in facial features or fashion accessories affects its ability to return accurate results. Why is face attendance better than thumb-based or fingerprint systems? 1. Practically 100% accuracy: Thumb-based attendance systems have often failed in situations where the fingerprint is faded. Workers who work in oiling systems can’t register their attendance with faded thumb prints. Similarly heena applications or cuts on fingers return errors. It is often frustrating to try attendance multiple times before simply writing down in a manual attendance register. That is not the case with face recognition attendance . It has been tried, tested and proven that it is practically 100% accurate. Employees simply walk towards it and attendance is captured. It works even when hairstyles change or employees age. 2. Touchless safety: With covid-19, the world has become increasingly aware of the risks of contact-based attendance systems. There is no attendance system, other than face id attendance system which is absolutely touchfree. The user has to simply show his face. The system is triggered automatically. Even after the world is covid-free, people will be conscious of the touches they make and it will be good to provide a hygienic system. 3. No complex hardware: Thumb based systems always require that you install a machine at the entrance. While the upfront costs are a barrier in itself, the machine requires maintenance too. When you choose a face attendance system like Truein, there is no complex machine. You simply install the application on any Android or iOS system and it works. Often, companies use just a tablet or mobile for Truein face attendance. 4. Remote access: Not every staff member steps into the office every day. There are remote workers or on-the-go field staff who report directly to client offices, distributor’s godown or other places. If you have rigid systems that require machines or hardware, it won’t work out for remote workers. With Truein mobile-based face recognition systems it is possible to allow on-the-go workers to take attendance from their own phone, wherever they are. Companies can restrict the mobile-based attendance to specific geographies , geo-fencing it, making it more secure and controlled. 5. Wow experience: With attendance time cut-down to a second and no action required from the user-end, face id attendance is by far the best biometric system. It wows employees who don’t require training and are happy to adopt immediately. When a face id system is based by a powerful application, it is even more welcome. Employees can track their records from the phone and managers can track everyone in real-time. 6. Reliability: Face recognition attendance systems like Truein have spoof-proof mechanisms. Employees may be required to blink their eyes before capturing attendance. It ensures no photos are used in the attendance process to mark proxies. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Frequently asked questions: 1. Which biometric attendance system is more reliable and accurate? Time and again it has been proven that fingerprint systems fail when fingers are dirty, oily, wet or bruised. Face attendance is practically 100% accurate. 2. Which biometric attendance system is more affordable? Thumb based systems require sensor-based machine installation at every site, making it costly in the beginning and also at the time of maintenance. With face attendance, any Android or iOS based mobile may be sufficient. Even employees can track their face ID with their own phone. Even retail stores with multiple outlets or construction companies with multiple sites find face attendance more affordable. Make an informed decision There are many choices available today. Not every finger print system or every face attendance system is made equal. Evaluate the options between various vendors or brands and make an informed choice. Be sure to ask questions like: Does the attendance system have geo-fencing? Does the system require hardware installation and maintenance? Does the system have mobile-based capabilities? Asking the right questions will help you choose the most advanced biometric attendance system. Schedule a free demo today and try Truein face recognition attendance system which has all the features that a biometric attendance system should have.

In other words, if a worker punches attendance during general shift timings, the system will automatically assign general shift to him. 2. Get the Truein job mapping feature If you activate job mapping, every worker will have to select his job ID at the time of attendance. If his job ID gets wrongly selected, the admin will have the rights to change it from the web dashboard. This ensures attendance is linked to job IDs. Why should you link an attendance system with shift scheduling and job mapping features? 1. Make it fool-proof: An attendance system has critical records about a worker’s in-time, out-time, hour clocked, leaves, overtime and so on. It is important from a compliances stand point and also from remuneration point of view. It should not be left to manual syncs and reconciliations. When you automate everything, you can be assured of an audit trail too. 2. Make it convenient: It is easy for everyone to view their allocated shifts through the Truein face attendance system. The admins can focus on the more important tasks and let Truein automatically allocate shifts or track assigned shifts. 3. Get powerful analytics: When you do job mapping and shift scheduling through the attendance system, you are recording critical data on a daily basis. It builds into our powerful analytics and reports. You can see insights around: How many workers are coming in their allocated shifts? Which shifts have least or most attendance? Which shifts have overtime issues? Which worker or department needs to be appreciated or warned? All of it can be viewed in real-time by the employer as well as the workers in the web dashboard or the mobile dashboard. Critical decisions need not wait until the end of the month; the organization can be more agile. 4. Meet compliance standards: Time tracking is an important legal requirement as well. Compensation may vary depending on shifts – night workers may have higher hourly pay for instance. The overtime rates may also vary based on shifts – weekend rates may be higher. All of this can be managed from one powerful Truein system. The time and location stamps are tamper-proof. They are not dependent on the user’s system but on our servers. So, they can be used for all audits. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Never again go the manual way Truein face attendance system has been tried and tested by big brands across the country with large shift-based staff.

Streamline your attendance process PC Jewellers made their retail stores safe with touchless face attendance Customer Stories Sites 91 Staff 1000+ Country India Industry Retail/Distributed Stores About PC Jewellers PC Jewellers is a national retail chain in the jewelry industry. Their flagship store, located at Karol Bagh in Delhi, was opened in 2005. With more than 91 stores across India, PC Jewellers has made a remarkable journey. Being the most reputed player in the hallmarked jewelry market, they stand for trust and high-quality designs. Umesh Arya Head IT PC Jewellers Previously, we used a standalone attendance system at various sites, due to which tracking and reconciling records at a central level was tedious and error-prone. Once we implemented Truein in August 2020, attendance management became hassle-free, and all the required reports were available with a single click. The rollout was smooth, and all our 60+ stores in the major geographical regions of India went live within 2-3 days. We have around 1500 staff now using Truein. The touchless technology brings a sense of safety, and our staff finds the system very user-friendly. We have also set up attendance policies like break-time, overtime, etc., as per our requirements. Monthly timesheets and reports are generated with automated calculations based on the policies. The team has been very supportive in guiding and helping us whenever needed.

Umesh Arya Head IT Challenges Before the pandemic outbreak, PC Jewellers used a thumb-based attendance system at their large stores and maintained manual entries at their small stores. As a result, there was no way to sync records at the national level, leading to a lack of transparency. Besides, with the pandemic hitting hard, it was essential to implement a high level of safety to get their staff back to work. They wanted to bring in a foolproof and touchless attendance system that could: Be quickly rolled out nationwide without infrastructure challenges Provide accurate time and attendance, and enable the staff to mark their attendance easily without the need for any training Replicate the the reporting structure rightly in the solution, so that the right access is available to managers Help implement stringent retail store policies to ensure discipline on the following fronts: Late marks; Overtime; Shift timings Ensure attendance gets captured in remote locations that face frequent internet issues Solution PC Jewellers implemented the Truein attendance solution in record time across their stores. Truein offered them: Touchless face attendance for the safety of their staff Mobile based attendance , which required no hardware installation overheads Geo-fenced attendance to ensure attendance marking is done only at approved store locations Admin settings to replicate the detailed reporting structure in the solution. Site settings for location-wise holidays and other policies Do you want to know more ? Talk to us Watch a demo Result Truein made it possible to implement a cost-effective, safe, and accurate attendance solution across locations without cost or time barriers. With Truein, PC Jewellers got rid of their multiple attendance systems and had just one touchless attendance system nationwide. The convenience of the Truein mobile app made everything from taking attendance to viewing real-time reports easy. The geo-fencing feature allowed the staff to use their phones to mark attendance at approved locations. As the staff used their mobiles for attendance, no hardware costs had to be borne by the store. Every store had custom HR policies, yet data could be synced automatically at the national level. Remote stores that face internet issues could use Truein in offline mode to capture data, which gets synced when connectivity is restored.

Implement Face recognition based attendance for your organisation – in hours, not days! May 31, 2024 Face recognition sounds like the technology of the future and it is natural to have inhibitions like – prohibiting costs, a long learning curve and so on. Fortunately, those are just myths. In this article, we address your biggest fear – change management. Will moving to a new System require new training, complex hardware or large upfront investments? Absolutely not. Some face recognition system work only with their own accompanying hardware which is not easy to get around. While it was the easiest way to launch Truein, we researched for years to bring you a solution that is totally hardware independent. Table of Contents Why should you opt for a hardware-independent Attendance System? 1. There are no entry or exit barriers 2. It works on user mobiles too 3. There are no operating system woes 4. It lives on and off internet 5. It is portable 6. It is easy to maintain Take the first step. We do the rest Why do we claim one day kick-off? Why should you opt for a hardware-independent Attendance System? 1. There are no entry or exit barriers The idea is to allow employees to come face-to-face with an app that recognizes them and marks attendance. Truein is that AI-powered employee attendance application which makes it possible. Question is – what do you install the app on?  Any smart device that fits your budget. It can be an existing large screen phone or a tablet you already own. In spite of being so versatile, our hardware-independent system is practically 100% accurate and works better than any complex system. 2. It works on user mobiles too If you are not ready to invest in a tablet yet, you can ask employees to mark attendance from their very own phones. Worried they will mark attendance from home, without stepping into the premise? Geo-fence it – Define the geographic boundaries of attendance. Only when they are in that radius, they will be able to do it. 3. There are no operating system woes We’ve ensured that our staff attendance system is truly universal. Pick any Android or iOS based mobile or tablet and you are good to go. 4. It lives on and off internet Do you want your attendance data to get updated in real-time, showing managers instant reports? You would need Wi-fi or 4G data. If you are in a remote location where connectivity is an issue, Truein will still work just fine. It will operate in offline mode, allowing attendance or visitor management to take place without a glitch. When the internet connection gets restored, the data will get automatically synced. 5. It is portable Unlike a hardware-based system which would require a technician to install and uninstall, we have no such hassle. Your office has moved to a new location? Simply take your tablet along and place it at the new entrance. 6. It is easy to maintain If the hardware device you install gives you hiccups, you don’t have to fret. Like we mentioned, no technician required. You troubleshoot it like you would troubleshoot any Android or iOS device. And if you still need help, we are always a call away. Take the first step. We do the rest The biggest barrier to adopting new technology is ‘apprehension’. Deep down, all of us fear change and the ‘unknown’ complexities it might bring. That leads to procrastination – putting it off to another day. HR departments put up with tons of manual work, annoying syncs and the woes of traditional attendance systems or visitor management systems because moving to a new solution seems like a mammoth task. Sometimes it helps to talk to an expert to find out if those fears are grounded in reality or they are just myths. We have installed Truein at organizations as small as twenty employees and as large as fifty thousand employees. The feedback is unanimous – it takes a day to get started and it is the most intuitive system. The COVID Pandemic situation made us switch to new normal in many ways and one of them was switching from Biometric attendance system to touchless attendance system . We enquired with many vendors and suppliers for such products and finally we opted for Truein – Touchless Face based attendance system for our Shindewadi plant.

Why face-recognition technology is the only way forward for businesses? May 31, 2024 Face recognition technology was used to bar intruders in the Avenger Towers. Does it ring a bell? What was sci-fi yesterday, is a reality today. The most obvious application is security – the Forensics department identifying criminals, the Highway authorities identifying speeders, the Airport authorities recognizing fleeing convicts. There are more fun applications too – Facebook allowing you to tag your pictures. Have businesses used these insights? Of course, yes. When you read these use-cases, you might get a ‘Aha’ moment Table of Contents Business Applications of face recognition technology Face recognition attendance 1. It leaves no margin for error 2. It is non-intrusive 3. It is contactless Face recognition visitor management system 1. It is as secure as it can get 2. It leaves a good impression 3. It is always-on Face recognition technology is accessible Business Applications of face recognition technology Face recognition attendance While biometric attendance has been around for a while, face recognition attendance is way ahead of the curve. Let’s look at the top three reasons why businesses have embraced it with both hands. 1. It leaves no margin for error The swipe not working, or the thumb not being recognized – which one are you used to? When you use an attendance system that doesn’t work at all times, you are allowing manual systems to take over. The manual system has to be synced back for the final tally. There is a scope for proxy as well as human error. Face recognition attendance is practically 100% accurate and reliable. It leaves no room for parallel systems. Leading face-recognition technologies benchmark the system with the eyes. An employee may grow old or fashionable – it doesn’t matter. No facial or hair change can hamper its ability to recognize. 2. It is non-intrusive Most attendance systems require a user action like placing their thumb on the keypad for identifying its geometry. Many may or may not want to part with this personal data and may find it unsecure. Users have shown less concerns with leaving their picture behind as it is easily accessible on social media or other public domains any way. 3. It is contactless The user just passes by the hardware and the system completes the scan. With COVID, this is a necessity. Even otherwise, it reduces attendance time to one second and leads to zero queuing up outside the gates. Can you imagine the happiness score when an everyday chore becomes this convenient? We’ve seen this work like charm in even organizations with fifty thousand employees. And that is not the benchmark – it can work with an unlimited database. Face recognition visitor management system It is appalling to see large organizations leave important matters such as security to one man at the gate. While we don’t doubt his efficiency, it is definitely not fool proof. Here are top three reasons enterprises have moved to face recognition-based visitor management system . 1. It is as secure as it can get With face recognition, anybody stepping in leaves a record in the system which can be back tracked or verified by anybody in the organization at a later date. Well, it is also real-time so large organizations can have multiple watchful eyes. Going to think of it, is there any other system that can leave breadcrumbs that lead back to the face of the visitor – the true identifier? 2. It leaves a good impression Signing manual books or standing at the gate while the employee confirms appointment is definitely not pleasing. And imagine standing in a queue to make a pass! We’ve all been there and done that. We’ve cursed and we’ve left stamping our feet. Why would we want to leave visitors with such agony? A face-recognition based technology at the door speaks volumes about how progressive your organization is. 3. It is always-on An enterprise never sleeps and is not on a holiday during weekends. You need systems to blacklist people, to send you notifications and to be vigilant. A face-recognition based system lets you manage visitors remotely and have an extra pair of eyes at the door.  Again, there is no margin for error. Face recognition technology is accessible Back in the 60s when the technology was first identified, the computing power was too low to render quick results. In the 2002 Super Bowl, the experiment failed badly due to false criminal alarms. Today, we have left it all behind and have achieved exceptional accuracy and reliability. It is not a privilege of multi-national organizations alone. It is affordable and accessible to even startups. It does not require any complex hardware as well. An organization deciding to implement it can start as early as yesterday with practically no barriers. It truly is the only way forward. Businesses that don’t adopt it run security risks and productivity losses. This technology is becoming widespread – out of the movies into our very own premises.

All data gets synced back in real-time, churning reports that can go straight into salary calculations and other reporting. Is that really practical? Can you actually do that without the need for manual overrides and physical syncs? After all, there are so many exceptions – branch wise holidays, employee wise weekly offs and so on. Well, we worked on all those exceptions and made them a rule within our employee attendance app . You can define all these unique possibilities and automate practically 100%. Let’s look into top 5 such compliances Table of Contents Top face attendance automations 1. Assign weekly off 2. Define public holidays 3. Set workhour calculations 4. Calculate overtime 5. Detect mask When convenience meets compliance Top face attendance automations 1. Assign weekly off While most of your employees may have Saturday and Sunday as weekly off, there would be contract workers or shift employees with different week offs. It is particularly true for call centers, plant operations or retail stores. How would the system know if an employee is absent or just has a weekly off? You get to define it. You can define employee categories (full time, part-time, contract, temporary, factory etc.) and then assign specific weekly offs for them. Of course, you can do it at an individual level or as a bulk action – either ways weekly offs can be taken care of easily. 2. Define public holidays In case of multinational organizations, the geography of the branch office defines the public holidays. For instance, an office in Maharashtra may have a public holiday on Uttaran. However, a branch in Kerela may have a public holiday on Onam instead. These differences don’t have to be manually entered. Each branch can be defined as a separate site with its own set of public holidays and other rules. 3. Set workhour calculations Are your salary calculations dependent on total hours clocked by the employee? There are several ways organizations can calculate it and it is possible to define your own rules. You can set the system in a way that it uses the ‘First in, Last out’ rule to report total hours clocked. Alternately, the system can calculate the actual time based on every single in and every single out. Either ways, it is easy to spot outliers who have too many outs or break-time. You can go a step further and define all days with less than 5 hours as part-time. 4. Calculate overtime If you have workers who get daily wages or whose renumeration is calculated ‘per hour’, you might have to pay them overtime for every extra hour. It is a common practice in factories, BPOs and Government organizations. Even this can be automated using a simple toggle (on/off) for each of the below pre-defined rules Above 9 hours in a day to be auto added as overtime Consecutive 7th day of work to be auto added as overtime (public holiday not counted) Work hours on public holiday will be added to overtime Overtime apply only when OT is more than 30 minutes Work hours on weekly off will be added to overtime If you would like to apply these rules to only a specific set of employees, you can segregate them by categories and tick or untick ‘apply overtime’ on relevant categories.  Employers can use this feature to automate time tracking and enforce overtime policy . 5. Detect mask Would you like to restrict entry to employees who are not wearing mask? Truein face recognition attendance system is geared to identify masks on their faces. It will deny entry in case attendance is marked without it. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account When convenience meets compliance Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

How does Face Recognition Technology work? June 21, 2024 How easy is it to identify a person you have met before? Usually, very easy! You may say it is because you remember him. Technically, your brain is matching it against a memory it has. Face recognition by machines work in a similar fascinating way. Table of Contents What is Face Recognition? Steps for Face Recognition Not all face recognition technology is created equal How Easy Is It To Beat Facial Recognition What makes Truein’s face recognition technology unique? Why face recognition is the most futuristic ID system? Read more: What is Face Recognition? The Dictionary definition of face recognition is the ability of a computer to scan, store, and recognize human faces for use in identifying people. Today this term is not very alien. Apple users use Face ID to unlock their phones. Airport security uses it to identify convicts. Workplace safety apps like Truein use it to mark attendance or authorize visitors. Steps for Face Recognition There are many variations of this technology. We will look at the most common approach. Let’s break down the definition. 1. Scan: A person walks by a machine that takes its picture and identifies its geometry. By geometry we mean distance of the nose from chin or location of eyes. There can be 60 to 80 such data points that make the complete face ID. 2. Store: The face ID, a mathematical formula consisting of data points is stored in the database. The computer understands this as your signature – unique to you. 3. Recognize: Next time you walk past the same machine, it can create a similar map and trace it against the database it has. Result? You are identified. Not all face recognition technology is created equal Face recognition was first invented by Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe in 1960s. Back then the degree of errors was vast and the amount of time it took to return a result was huge. Part of it was due to computing power of machines back then. Besides, the number of facial markers used to create a Face ID were low. In 1970s there were 21 facial markers. Today, the sophisticated machines use as many as 80, increasing accuracy. How Easy Is It To Beat Facial Recognition Facial recognition gets seriously compromised if the machine is not geared to identify in low-light or with changing facial features. It will result in two things: False negative: It won’t identify a person despite his ID being present in the database. It can be frustrating, but it is not dangerous. False positive: It will identify a person wrongly as another person. A false match is a bad sign, especially when law-enforcing agencies use it. It is therefore critical that you pick a face recognition technology that stands the test of time. A time-tested and proven technology by a trusted provider is the key to adopting this futuristic technology. What makes Truein’s face recognition technology unique? We believe that accuracy has to be practically hundred percent. Any small error leads to manual work, beating the purpose of our technology. This hundred percent perfection has happened over many years through many iterations. Today, we are proud to meet those benchmarks. Truein face recognition attendance is benchmarked with eyes. Result? No amount of facial changes can affect our performance. Ageing, hats, face masks – doesn’t matter. It works. We beat the odds. Our face recognition technology has proved to work in low-light conditions as well. So common work conditions like night shift workers or outdoor construction sites don’t pose a challenge to our system. It works offline too. So, there are practically no barriers to primary enterprise activities – face attendance and visitor management. Distant sites or stores too can use it seamlessly. We have invested in the necessary infrastructure to make it super-fast. We surely don’t want people to wait in queues while the device scans and marks face attendance for each employee. It takes just three seconds, including changeover time. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Why face recognition is the most futuristic ID system? Biometric IDs are unique and beat the traditional paper-pen or card systems hands down. Cards can be swiped by proxies and attendance can be fudged. It is a common malpractice, often seen at plants within contract workers. The thumb IDs are biometric too, but they have failed to meet the hundred percent benchmark. Women using Indian Mehndi on hands feel frustrated when their thumbs don’t get identified at office machines. Similarly, plant workers who work on oily machines cannot walk past a thumb-based system easily. Besides, it is not touchless, and it takes multiple attempts for one correct match. Face recognition is truly the only unique identifier, doing its job in few seconds. It cannot be proxies or scope for manual overrides.

How geo-fencing takes touchless attendance to the next level? June 21, 2024 Face recognition based attendance is the straight off answer to the touchless solution the world is seeking today. Or may it is not as straight. Not all face recognition attendance is made equal. It is important to consider specific use-cases before picking the one that works for you. Today, we will focus on use-cases for geo-fencing – a powerful feature on Truein’s contactless attendance system . Table of Contents What is geo-fencing? Who is it most relevant for? 1. Retail chains 2. Construction sites 3. Marketing and event agencies 4. Any other large organization What are the key advantages? 1. Being compliant: 2. Being progressive: 3. Being safe What should you know about geo-fencing on Truein? The bottom line What is geo-fencing? With Truein, organizations can allow users to mark attendance from their very own phone . Organization’s ability to limit such attendance to only a specific geography (usually a radius around the office) is called geo-fencing. Geo-fencing can be activated to ensure that employees don’t queue up in front of the kiosk at the main gates, conveniently use their own phone but do not misuse it while vacationing. Who is it most relevant for? 1. Retail chains Large retail chains can avoid putting a kiosk at every store. Each individual store can geo-fence attendance for their site and employees can mark attendance from their devices . It can result in huge savings while ensuring automation that syncs data back to the head-office in real-time. 2. Construction sites In case of outdoor locations, the supervisors need not report to office before going to the site. They can go to their work site directly and mark attendance after reaching that geo-fenced boundary. It makes sense for even contract workers who keep changing and report to site directly. 3. Marketing and event agencies Any organization that employs a large workforce that is on their feet and always on field, would find geo-fencing very useful. The geo-fencing feature can be used to mark radius around the distributor’s office where sales team reports. It can also be used to mark an event location where the marketing team is working. 4. Any other large organization In case you have a large employee strength, you can shorten the queue at the main gate by activating user-device based geo-fenced attendance. What are the key advantages? 1. Being compliant: We believe that automation of attendance should always be 100%. If you leave scope for manual entries in case of remote sites, on-field force etc., you are increasing chances of proxy and plenty of paperwork. When data for the entire workforce gets automated – no matter where they are, all of it can feed back into compliance and salary calculations. 2. Being progressive: The hard part about allowing employees to report directly to remote sites is the ability to track and trust. You can leave all of it behind and embrace progressive HR policies. Geo-fencing is your safety net – an assurance that all will be well even when you adopt laissez-faire policies. It sure leaves a good impact on employee satisfaction score as well. 3. Being safe When social-distancing is active and you have a large workforce queuing up at the kiosk, you could consider moving to geo-fenced user-device attendance. People can space out and mark attendance from their desks if they please. What should you know about geo-fencing on Truein? Truein has evolved over the last 4 years to include more than hundred features. Geo-fencing is only one of them. Like always we have focused on keeping it simple. It can be activated or deactivated by the user at a click of a button There is no limit to how many locations can be activated It is possible to geo-fence attendance by adding Google location address or latitude/longitude co-ordinates It is also possible to define the radius around the marked address. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account The bottom line Face recognition is the buzzword in touchless attendance .

How retail chains are solving the age-old attendance & compliance problem? June 21, 2024 It is (relatively) easy to track attendance in a corporate park or branch. How do you handle attendance tracking and compliance when you have dispersed outlets with varying staff strength of ten to fifty employees? Even large brands have not found the perfect answer. They end up using a mix of methodologies like thumb-based/card-swipe systems in larger stores and some manual registers in smaller ones. Neither are fool-proof and the age-old problem persists even today. Table of Contents What are the top retail attendance challenges and their solution? Retailers can heave a sigh of relief What are the top retail attendance challenges and their solution? 1. Hardware Installation: Installing a hardware for attendance at every single shop is not practical, especially when the staff strength is not large. Besides, retail chains are always in an expansion mode and installing hardware in all new stores is not a scalable idea. Solution: Opt for a biometric attendance system that will benefit your retail store , and a solution like Truein face attendance does not require any hardware installation. How face recognition attendance system works ? It works on any Android or iOS device. It can also be configured to work from an employee’s own phone. It is scalable to as many stores as one may need, without any added upfront hardware cost. 2. Remote locations: A lot of retail stores are located in far-off locations, with limited internet access. Most attendance systems require the internet to function and may be redundant in smaller towns. Solution: Always check if the system you shortlisted works in offline mode. Truein face attendance can work offline and sync data online when the internet comes available. That way, all stores can have a single attendance system. No exceptions! 3. Parallel systems: When attendance systems like the thumb or card don’t work at all times due to non-detection or errors, people start using parallel systems like manual registers. Smaller stores don’t have the infrastructure for maintenance and resort to alternatives. That makes the organization prone to proxies and leakages in the system which add hidden costs. Solution: Try to use a system that does not allow people to slip through. A face attendance software like Truein works practically hundred percent of all times. Thumb not being recognised or the card getting damaged are not the kind of excuses you hear with face recognition. It simply works, no matter what! 4. Store wise reconciliation: With retail chains using multiple systems across multiple stores, it is often a task to bring it all together at the end of the month and calculate salaries. Not to forget, there are sick leaves , casual leaves, public holidays and other such complexities too. It takes many man hours to sync this data across stores and of course, it can never be foolproof. Solution: An attendance system backed by solid software can link everything from holidays and leaves to shifts and compliances. Everything flows through just one comprehensive system so you can simply export the reports and disburse remunerations. No manual syncs! Truein makes it possible. 5. No visibility: It is not possible for HR or leadership teams to see what is happening at different outlets on a day-to-day basis. Attendance, compliances and all are left to local teams. Head office comes to know about the attendance percentages only at the end of the month when there is a manual sync. The system is not agile. It is difficult to ensure that rules are complied with. Solution: It is important to choose a system that syncs data in real-time back to the head office or HR admins. Anybody can see analytics through the web dashboard or on their mobile. Truein brings this power and transparency. 5. Shift management : Retail stores often operate for twelve hours. They have staff working in rotation shifts. Often, separate morning, afternoon and general shift registers are maintained to manually track the shift allocation and attendance . Again, another manual entry which has to be synced and is prone to human error. Solution: Have it all as part of the attendance system! Shift allocation is technically an extension of attendance and systems like Truein make it possible to link the two. One can allocate shifts in bulk to the entire staff via a simple spreadsheet upload or can do it individually for every staff member. Retailers can heave a sigh of relief Finally, there is an attendance system that works in every situation – offline, with shifts, with compliance rules and more. One click enables complete sync and export for next steps like salary disbursement. Large retailers like PC Jewellers have trusted Truein and have rolled it out to their entire chain in no time – no hardware installation required, after all! When the pandemic posed more challenges to the already existing retail attendance woes, there was only one solution they could reliably depend on – face attendance with no hardware and a solid software.

Why you don’t need to install attendance machines? June 21, 2024 When companies evolved from paper-based attendance to one that was technology enabled, they were asked to install machines for card swiping or thumb imprints. Once upon a time that felt like an obvious choice. Not anymore! If you are still installing bulky attendance systems, you are probably living in a cave. There are choices. Go hardware-less! Table of Contents Introducing hardware-less face recognition attendance Why does hardware-based attendance increase liability? 1. Initial investment 2. Recurring maintenance 3. Lack of portability 4. Parallel systems 5. Limited use case 6. Onboarding pain Step into the future Read More: Introducing hardware-less face recognition attendance The charm of technology is not in its complexity, but in its practicality. Consider Truein’s face attendance app – it can be installed on any tablet or mobile to get started in no time. A common tablet (any Android or iOS device) at the gate is all the infrastructure you need. Or better still – install nothing! Ask your employees to do a selfie-attendance from their very own phone. How do you ensure they are not marking attendance from home or a beach holiday? With Truein geo-fencing, of course. Our geofencing attendance feature lets employees mark selfie attendance only from geographical boundaries set by you. Define the radius from your office and you are set. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Why does hardware-based attendance increase liability? 1. Initial investment If you have hundred construction sites or two hundred retail stores, would you invest a machine everywhere? The cost would multiply manifold. Besides, nothing lives forever. You are looking at a similar investment every few years. 2. Recurring maintenance Hardware that you or your IT does not understand will always have an external dependency. It will have its maintenance requirements. It means calling the technicians every time you hit a snag. It can also mean annual maintenance contracts and more cost. In comparison an Android or iOS based simple tablet or mobile needs little to no troubleshooting. And anyone can do it! 3. Lack of portability Typical hardware-based systems have heavy installations which act as permanent fixtures. They are immovable. They sit with your furniture. When you move somewhere, you need a technician again. Contrast that with a simple iOS or Android-based mobile attendance system with a temporary stand. Move it around as you please. Rainy days? Move it inside. No problem! 4. Parallel systems Whether it is card-based system or thumb-based system, you always hear complains about card not getting recognized or thumb not being accepted. An oily hand or scratches on card are common reasons for the system to not work. Result? The admin pulls out a manual entry register which is reconciled end of the month. We take attendance seriously. With Truein face attendance , you get practically hundred percent accuracy and reliability. No parallel systems, please! 5. Limited use case When you install a hardware, you are only thinking about your desk employees. What about your field workers or mobile workforce? Can a marketing manager mark attendance from agency’s office? Can a salesperson report from distributor’s office? Not if they need a large machine to mark attendance. Consider the Truein mobile-based selfie attendance. It works for very many use cases: On field staff doesn’t have to come to office only to mark attendance In construction industry or similar industry where sites keep changing, there is no unnecessary infrastructure created. The security guard can take attendance of all contract workers from his device. Retail outlets which run in hundreds and thousands can just geo-fence their stores and let employees mark attendance from their phones. 6. Onboarding pain Every time a new employee joins in, there is a long process of thumb registration or card activation. How would you like to replace it with a face recognition system that lets new employees click a selfie and onboard themselves in no time? You will like it very much, especially when the organization grows. Think scale? Think ease of onboarding with face attendance. It becomes even more relevant when you are dealing with contract staff that changes on daily basis. The common bane in the construction industry! Step into the future Don’t hold yourself in the past. In the 21st century, getting an attendance machine is like buying a keypad based mobile. It is like using pigeons when you can use emails. Embrace technology that is light, portable and practical. Go touchless, go hardware-less. Read More: 5 Attendance compliances you can automate easily (like-never-before) How geo-fencing takes touchless attendance to the next level?

We’ve helped construction companies get over their biggest bane with a practical solution, especially designed for them. Table of Contents The current attendance scenario in the construction industry 1. Buddy punching: 2. Manual errors: 3. Reconciliation pain: How can construction industry have better attendance monitoring? 1. Portability: 2. No proxy: 3. Fast onboarding: 4. Geo-fencing: Testimonial from a leading construction brand Read more: The current attendance scenario in the construction industry Construction companies would agree that there are no fixed sites. New sites come up and old ones close down all too often. It is not practical to install machines to track attendance. Manual attendance by the security guard is the most common practice. The result? 1. Buddy punching: Who is signing attendance for whom? Nobody would ever know. The actual site may have ten people, but the company may be paying for twelve. Small leakages like these in the contract labour attendance system can result in big cheques and losses eventually. It can also have legal and security implications too as there is no real way of knowing who you are employing. 2. Manual errors: Even in a perfect world where everyone is honest and truthful at attendance time, there is scope for mistakes. There can be date errors or spelling errors. Contract labour may not be educated enough to realize it and it may go completely unnoticed. 3. Reconciliation pain: Manual attendance at the end of the day, week or month has to be converted into excels for payroll processing. It can be many days of unproductive work, further prone to errors. How can construction industry have better attendance monitoring? Truein face attendance app is one with many solutions for the construction industry. Let’s break it down for simplicity. 1. Portability: Your sites keep changing so you don’t have to invest in attendance infrastructure. Install any temporary stand to hold a tablet at the gate and let workers simply walk in using face attendance. Don’t have a closed gated site? Truein face attendance needs no hardware. It works on any Android or iOS mobile too. The security guard can be given a mobile to take face attendance of contract workers on site. 2. No proxy: What you see is what you get! A face recognition-based system cannot be fudged or overridden. Besides, Truein works in the most complex scenarios too: Construction site has low-light or works in night shift? Our system works. Construction site is in a remote location with no internet? Truein works offline too. Truein works practically hundred percent of times so there is no scope for parallel systems like manual registers. 3. Fast onboarding: When you have contract staff that keeps changing every day, you cannot afford to have a slow or long onboarding system. How about a one-click system? The new joinee captures his face from the kiosk or mobile and his onboarding is completed. Every other detail like reporting manager, contractor agency, shift assignment etc. can be managed in our web dashboard later. 4. Geo-fencing: If you want to restrict the attendance of a worker to one site, you can do that using our technology. We allow you to fence the attendance by marking the GPS location. He can mark his attendance only within those geographical boundaries. All entries get stamped with location and time, so you have a verifiable audit trail at all times. Practically no-fuss, quick and accurate system is what we have to offer. What’s more? We have clients in the construction industry who have used our system for more than four years at multiple sites on a large scale. Tried and tested? You got it! Testimonial from a leading construction brand Girish Nambalkar from SJ Contracts says, “Using a face attendance system at construction sites was a big challenge. Team Truein calmly understood our requirement and provided required customization too. Truein is an excellent solution. As of today, we are using Truein attendance system at our 22 sites. We found that Truein is more user-friendly and easier to use.

Similarly, the marketing staff has to do market visits or go for meetings at agency offices. Rarely does the sales or marketing team report to head office for attendance. More often than not, there is a manual attendance register that gets reconciled at month-end. In other cases, the managers receive out-of-office request emails from their subordinates and the manager has to manually override absent marks in the system. Either ways, it is a painful exercise. FMCG companies have figured an easier way to overcome this issue. What did they do? Table of Contents 1. Embrace face attendance: 2. Allow selfie-based attendance: 3. Take advantage of geo-fencing: 4. Rely on system stamps: 5. Create a unified system: Key learnings from FMCG 1. Embrace face attendance: Face attendance is the only form of attendance that cannot be fudged or misused. Card based attendance can invite proxies as workers do buddy punching . Thumb based attendance is known to have recognition issues which give rise to parallel systems like manual registers. Face attendance, especially on reliable systems like Truein, works with practically 100% accuracy. No misrepresentation. FMCG companies have built trust and reliability within their sales departments with the power of face attendance. 2. Allow selfie-based attendance: Large FMCG companies have given up the idea of calling the sales team to head office for attendance. It is not practical and it is not productive. They have placed an attendance system in every salespersons’ palm. Sales people simply download the Truein app and turn their very own mobiles into attendance systems. They can upload their attendance selfies and register attendance from wherever they are – on field, at agency office or in market. 3. Take advantage of geo-fencing: Companies have marked territories by defining GPS boundaries in the Truein face attendance system . Sales and marketing staff can take selfie attendance from wherever they are, as long as they fall within the approved geography. So a sales person can’t log attendance from home. He has to be at a specific location which need not be the head office. It can be the distributor’s office, geo-fenced by their HR team. Geo-fencing lets companies adapt progressive policies like ‘anywhere attendance’ without worrying about misuse. 4. Rely on system stamps: Can employees change their device time and location to manipulate attendance stamps? No way. Companies that have implemented the Truein way of attendance know that the system is robust. The system stamps take only the server time and cannot be played around with. All time and location stamps are preserved, creating a robust audit trail. Sales and marketing staff can be made accountable and can be questioned if the records look suspicious. 5. Create a unified system: The biggest reason why some FMCG companies have been able to overcome the age-old attendance problem is through their reliance on forward-looking technology. They cut down the parallel systems like manual registers or email approvals completely. They use Truein as the single-source of truth for all attendance related matters. Truein is used for all of the following: Marking attendance on kiosk or employee mobiles Sending leave requests and approving them Managing shifts Managing employee overtime policy and calculating overtime hours and other compliances When there is a single unified system, it is easy to manage massive records and there is no need for manual reconciliations. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Key learnings from FMCG When you are dealing with a large workforce that works from out-of-office, you need the power of automation . Manual registers won’t do. There has to be a balance of freedom and compliance. Employees are less stressed out and yet the company has audit trails. It is important to work with proven technologies like Truein and overcome many problems in one clean shot.

Employers are leveraging modern technology to optimize workforce management with the growing demand for work-life balance. Enterprises are using attendance software as a groundbreaking solution for workforce management, leveraging unique biological traits to verify employee identity and track attendance. As a result, the attendance software market is growing at a CAGR of 9.29% and is forecasted to reach USD 3800 million by 2027 . The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, additionally, is particularly benefiting from biometric attendance systems, where rapid economic growth and a diverse workforce necessitate advanced and reliable attendance tracking mechanisms.

Conclusion FAQs Q. How does a biometric attendance system work? Q. Are biometric attendance systems secure? Q. Are biometric attendance systems suitable for all types of businesses? Q. Can biometric attendance systems operate offline? Q. What types of biometrics are commonly used in attendance systems? Q. How does a time attendance system help with labor law compliance? Q. Are there any legal or privacy concerns associated with biometric attendance systems? Understanding Biometric Attendance Systems Unlike traditional methods that rely on PINs, passwords, or swipe cards, a biometric attendance machine uses physical characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, ensuring higher accuracy and security. Facial recognition technology is transforming biometric time and attendance systems. Its precision and speed streamline employee check-ins, enhancing security and minimizing errors. This non-invasive method ensures accurate attendance records, reduces the risk of fraud, and optimizes workforce management, making it a standout feature in modern HR solutions. At its core, a biometric attendance system captures and stores biometric data, such as facial features or fingerprints of employees, in a decentralized database. This data is then used to authenticate individuals as they check in and out of the workplace. Adopting biometric attendance in workforce management offers numerous advantages, including eliminating time theft, reducing administrative burden, and enhancing overall security. How Does a Time and Attendance System Work with Biometrics? Time and attendance systems conventionally work with manual entry and punch cards, but modern systems utilize biometric data capture and authentication mechanisms. First, the employees’ biometric data is captured and stored in the system. This usually involves capturing facial images, scanning fingerprints or recording iris patterns. The algorithms of an attendance system with biometrics compare the presented biometric data with the stored information to verify identity when employees show their biometric traits to the system. Upon successful verification, the biometric attendance system records the time of entry or exit, thereby logging the attendance. The recorded attendance data is processed and compiled into reports, which can be used for payroll, compliance, and performance tracking. Biometric systems ensure the recorded data is highly accurate, reducing errors associated with manual time tracking. Features of Biometric Authenticated Time & Attendance System While biometrics are often linked to hardware solutions, software-based biometric systems offer a more efficient alternative. These solutions leverage advanced algorithms for secure, seamless authentication, reducing the need for specialized hardware and enhancing accessibility across various devices and platforms. Here are some features of the Biometric Time & Attendance System. Biometric Recognition Methods for Attendance Fingerprint recognition is one of the most widely used biometric technologies in time and attendance systems. It involves a fingerprint biometric device that scans an employee’s fingerprint and compares it with stored data for identity verification. The system you wish to buy should be capable of storing and verifying the fingerprints. As the business grows, the system should be capable of storing fingerprint details of all employees. However, facial attendance systems are increasingly favored over fingerprint methods due to their inherent advantages. Unlike fingerprint scanners which can be affected by factors like greasy fingers or cuts, facial recognition remains consistent and reliable in various environmental conditions. Moreover, facial systems require minimal hardware and offer greater portability, facilitating easier deployment across different locations. These benefits make facial attendance a more practical and efficient choice for modern workplaces and organizations seeking reliable attendance tracking solutions. Attendance Management Biometric attendance systems streamline management by automatically recording employee check-in and check-out times. This eliminates manual tracking and minimizes errors, ensuring accurate and reliable attendance records. Biometric Integration Choose a biometric attendance system that can be integrated with other workplace management tools, such as access control systems, payroll software, and human resource management systems (HRMS). Be it for time tracking, attendance or payroll, the biometric system should integrate with management and authentication solutions within the software only. And if not, then it should facilitate integration with other tools too. Data Security Measures Biometric attendance systems employ encryption and secure storage techniques to protect sensitive biometric data from unauthorized access and breaches. Compliance with data protection regulations is also ensured to safeguard employee privacy. Reporting and Analytics Advanced biometric attendance systems come with robust reporting and analytics capabilities. The comprehensive reports on attendance patterns, employee punctuality, and overtime help management make informed decisions. The system you choose should have good reporting functions to offer a comprehensive view of the operations. As for online attendance tracking, it should show the status of every employee whether present, late, absent or leaving early. Key Benefits of Biometric Attendance Systems Regardless of their size or industry throughout UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and other countries in the Middle East, businesses utilize biometric time and attendance systems for several benefits. Here are the key benefits of deploying a biometric time attendance system: Real-Time Monitoring Biometric attendance systems offer real-time monitoring capabilities such as GPS and geofencing, allowing managers to track employee attendance instantly. This feature is handy for large organizations and those with multiple locations, enabling centralized oversight and timely intervention when issues arise. Prevents Buddy Punching Buddy punching is a time-theft practice where one employee clocks in for another, resulting in financial loss and a demotivated workforce. Biometric systems eliminate this problem by ensuring only individuals with the registered biometric trait can record their attendance. Accuracy and Reliability on Attendance Automated time and attendance recording offers unparalleled accuracy and reliability in tracking attendance. There is no scope for errors and manipulation. Biometric systems are the most accurate way of identifying employees as they are unique to every individual and cannot be forged or duplicated. Such systems assist the businesses to track employee attendance and time accurately. With such technology, cases of arriving late, leaving early or working without approval will be easily eliminated. Eliminating Time Theft As biometric attendance systems are highly accurate, time theft, such as extended breaks or falsifying work hours, is eliminated. It significantly improves productivity and payroll costs. Biometric systems save the time of the employers that is spent on manually managing the attendance. And so through these systems, the total time of the employee is calculated automatically as per clock in and clock out timings. The employer can also download the attendance report of the employee with ease. Streamlined Payroll Processing Biometric time attendance systems simplify payroll processing by accurately recording and calculating work hours. This reduces administrative workload, minimizes payroll errors, and ensures timely and accurate salary payments. Time Saving Automation and streamlining are made effective by biometric attendance systems, saving time for employees and administrative staff. Employees can quickly check in and out, and administrative staff spend less time verifying and processing attendance data. Biometric devices save employers time that would otherwise be spent manually managing attendance. The employee’s total time will be calculated automatically based on the clock-in and clock-out times. Through a biometric attendance system, an employer can simply download an employee’s attendance report. Implementing Biometric Attendance Systems in the GCC The Biometric Time and Attendance Systems can be the most revolutionizing for your business. If you are ready to adopt a biometric attendance system, here are the factors to consider: Choosing the Right System: When choosing a biometric attendance system, factors such as the type of biometric technology (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.), ease of use, integration capabilities, and cost should be considered. Decide whether you need a standalone biometric device for attendance or a cloud-based solution like Truein that can handle in-house, distributed, and remote workforce. Integration with Existing Systems: Any new system you introduce in your business ecosystem must integrate with systems such as existing HR and payroll to ensure seamless operations and maximize the benefits of automation. This integration facilitates data sharing and reduces the need for manual data entry, enhancing overall efficiency. Training and Support: Effective implementation of the biometric attendance system you choose requires adequate training and support for both employees and administrators. Select a solution that is user-friendly and intuitive, reducing the need for extensive training. This ensures employees can easily grasp its usage, while administrators can efficiently manage and troubleshoot the system. Data Privacy and Security: Ensuring data privacy and security is crucial for businesses in the Middle East countries. Any biometric attendance system you choose must comply with local data protection regulations and implement robust security measures to protect biometric data from unauthorized access and breaches. Challenges and Solutions for Biometric Attendance Systems Implementing biometric attendance systems offers significant benefits, but it also comes with challenges that organizations must address to ensure smooth operation and acceptance. Data Privacy Concerns As biometric data is susceptible, concerns about its collection, storage, and potential misuse exist. Choosing a system with robust data protection measures is a simple solution. Systems like Truein implement strong encryption and secure data in cloud storage to protect biometric data. Choose a system that is compliant with data protection regulations. Technical Issues One of the challenges preventing businesses in the GCC region from adopting biometric systems is the apprehension regarding technical problems like sensor malfunctions, software glitches, or integration challenges. Digital adoption typically involves specific technical infrastructure requirements. Opting for a software-based solution with minimal hardware dependency can mitigate these concerns. Such solutions often offer robust technical support and maintenance services, ensuring prompt resolution of any issues that may arise. User Resistance Employees may resist adopting new technology, especially if they have privacy concerns or are unfamiliar. The solution offers comprehensive training programs to familiarize employees with the biometric system. Address privacy concerns transparently and highlight the system’s benefits in gaining employee buy-in. The Need for Advanced Workforce Management in the GCC Region The GCC region attracts businesses and workers driven by its rapid economic growth and transformation. This growth necessitates advanced workforce management solutions to manage a diverse and expanding labor force effectively. Economic Growth These countries are experiencing rapid economic growth, driven by diversification efforts and large-scale infrastructure projects. To benefit from such an economic boom, businesses need to expand, and advanced workforce management is the only way to ensure that companies can scale their operations effectively. Compliance and Regulation The GCC has evolving labor laws and regulations. Businesses in these countries must comply with these requirements. Advanced workforce management systems help organizations adhere to regulatory requirements, minimizing the risk of legal issues and penalties. Diverse Workforce The GCC region and the rest of the Middle East has a highly diverse workforce that includes temporary/contractual workers, and full-time employees. Advanced workforce management systems help manage this diversity effectively by providing equitable and transparent attendance tracking.

The shopping experience is one of the significant experiences in cities like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, and Riyadh. These Middle Eastern cities are home to the world’s most luxurious and expansive shopping centers. A distinctive feature of retail hubs here is that they are not just commercial spaces but cultural landmarks reflecting the region’s rapid economic growth and modernization. Shopping mall management is a complex task involving overseeing diverse aspects, from tenant relations to marketing strategies. Among these, workforce management is the most fundamental requirement of shopping center management. With workforce management, shopping center management companies can optimize employee productivity. With effective employee management, shopping malls can ensure that they can keep track of attendance, manage shifts, and provide optimal staffing levels even if they employ hundreds, sometimes thousands of staff. Embracing modern infrastructure such as face recognition time attendance systems for tracking employees’ work hours becomes crucial.

Role of Technology in Facility Management of Malls Overcoming Implementation Challenges Future Trends in Retail and Mall Management The Role of Training and Development Leveraging Data for Strategic Decisions Legal and Ethical Considerations How does Truein help shopping centers and retail stores with Workforce Management and Time and Attendance tracking of employees? Conclusion The Evolving Landscape of Middle Eastern Shopping Centers The Middle East is experiencing a shopping mall boom in the last few decades. This growth is made possible by the emerging retail sector in the Gulf region. According to a report by Alpen Capital, the GCC retail sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% to USD 370 billion by 2026 . We are witnessing this growth through increasing numbers and sizes of regional shopping malls. Not only are shopping malls becoming more extensive, but shopping mall facilities management is getting sophisticated, too. Technology is becoming increasingly integral to their management and operations. If you visit sprawling shopping malls in cities like Dubai, you will see retail innovation at every step, from intelligent parking systems to AI-powered customer service kiosks. The increasing demand for efficiency of operation is pushing shopping center management companies to look for a technical revolution. Mall managers are turning to advanced solutions for everything, right from energy management to security. However, the most impact is on workforce management. Shopping Mall and Retail Management in the Middle East In large establishments like shopping malls, the mall managers look after the day-to-day operations, tenant management, and marketing management. While this is true for retail establishments in any country, the size and geographical elements in the Middle East pose challenges for companies dealing with shopping mall property management. Day-to-day Operations Management Day-to-day operations management in shopping malls is a complex task. As it involves coordinating staff across various departments, from security to maintenance, management needs workforce management tools like time and attendance management to make the workforce more efficient. It is crucial to manage facility workers to ensure the mall remains clean, safe, and welcoming. Tenant Management Another aspect is tenant management because malls can only function by maintaining good tenant relationships. To ensure that visitors and shoppers have a pleasant experience, mall managers need to ensure their retailers’ needs are met while at the same time enforcing mall policies and standards. Competition is fierce in the retail sector in the Middle East; no mall can expect to attract customers and drive footfall without marketing management. This involves planning and executing promotional events, managing social media presence, and coordinating with tenants for joint marketing initiatives. The Need for Effective Workforce Management Any company engaged in shopping mall management must know the potential challenges of managing a large and diverse workforce. Challenges faced by Shopping Malls in Managing Large Workforce Here are some of the prominent challenges faced by shopping malls in the Middle East: Shift Management Managing multiple shifts can be a severe challenge when staff numbers run in thousands, and shopping malls operate for hours late at night. The concern is to ensure adequate staffing levels during peak hours while avoiding overstaffing during quiet periods. This can only be achieved with shift scheduling software. Time Theft Traditional time-tracking methods like punch cards are susceptible to “buddy punching,” where one employee clocks in for another. When hundreds of workers are involved, this can lead to significant financial losses. Compliance The Middle East has some of the strictest labor laws that consider special events like Ramadan when deciding shift hours, working hours, overtime, and breaks. Compliance with these laws is crucial but can be difficult to track manually. Diverse Workforce In the GCC countries, more than 66% of the workforce is expats . Unsurprisingly, most Middle Eastern shopping malls employ staff from various nationalities. This can lead to communication challenges and differing work cultures. High Turnover Just like in any other economy, the retail sector in the Middle East often experiences high employee turnover, making it crucial to have efficient onboarding and offboarding processes. These workforce management challenges can be overcome by implementing efficient time and attendance solutions like Truein. It is essential for shopping mall facilities management to ensure that all areas of the mall are adequately staffed at all times, from cleaning crews to security personnel. Benefits of Implementing Advanced Workforce Management Systems Improved Accuracy: Automated systems reduce human error in time-tracking and payroll calculations. Enhanced Productivity: By offering real-time insights into staffing levels, such systems help mall managers make quick adjustments to ensure optimal productivity. Cost Savings: Accurate time-tracking prevents overpayment due to time theft or calculation errors. Better Compliance: Automated systems can flag potential labour law violations, helping managers ensure compliance. Data-Driven Decision Making: Analytics and reporting features of advanced time and attendance tracking systems provide valuable data that can inform long-term staffing strategies. Embracing Face Recognition Time Attendance Systems Face recognition technology has become a preferred biometric system for time and attendance systems implemented across industries in the Middle East. This technology uses facial biometric data to identify individuals, making it virtually impossible to buddy punch and eliminating time theft. The face recognition mechanism captures an employee’s face and compares it to a database of registered faces. If a match is found, the system logs the employee’s arrival or departure time. It is not only tempering proof but also more advantageous over traditional attendance methods: Accuracy: Face recognition is highly accurate. According to the American National Institute of Standards and Technology, face recognition technology has error rates as low as 0.08% . Speed: Employees can clock in or out in seconds without any manual input requirements, reducing queues and saving time. Hygiene: Unlike fingerprint scanners or punch cards, face recognition systems are contactless, making them more hygienic. Difficult to Deceive: Face recognition eliminates the possibility of “buddy punching.” Integration: These systems can easily integrate with other HR and payroll software for seamless operations. Integrating Workforce Management with Facility Management While separate domains, workforce management, and facility management have many overlapping aspects. The two are closely interlinked in the context of retail and mall management. With effective workforce management, shopping mall property management companies can ensure that the correct number of staff with the right skills are available at the proper times to maintain the facilities. How Integrated Systems can Improve Overall Mall Operations? Integrating workforce and facility management can improve the efficiency and quality of the shopping experience. For instance, if the two are interlinked, a sudden increase in footfall detected by mall sensors could trigger alerts in the workforce management system to deploy additional cleaning or security staff. Role of Technology in Facility Management of Malls Technology, especially Internet of Things (IoT) technology , is increasingly crucial in modern facility management. IoT sensors can monitor everything from air quality to occupancy levels. When integrated with workforce management systems, this data can inform staffing decisions in real-time. Overcoming Implementation Challenges While adopting new technologies like face recognition time attendance systems can provide the much-needed efficiency in operations, their implementation also presents challenges: Employee Resistance: Not all employees respond to such implementations positively. Some staff may need more confidence in biometric data collection. Technical Issues: Ensuring the system works reliably across lighting conditions and with a diverse workforce can be challenging. Integration: Integrating the new system with existing HR and payroll software may require additional work. While the implementation strategy to ensure seamless integration of face recognition time and attendance systems depends on the particular shopping mall technology infrastructure, some quick fixes exist to overcome these challenges. Here are a few Suggestions : Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to justify the investment before investing in any face recognition time and attendance solution. Before implementation, educate employees about the system’s benefits and promptly address privacy concerns transparently. Only go with reputable vendors with a proven record of offering and implementing such advanced solutions in similar environments. Do not deploy a facility-wide implementation. Instead, plan for a phased rollout, starting with a pilot program in one department to evaluate the effects. Comprehensive training for both staff and management. Future Trends in Retail and Mall Management Undoubtedly, the future of retail and mall management in the Middle East will likely be shaped by emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Concepts like predictive maintenance of facilities and personalised customer experiences are becoming increasingly popular. Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies back another revolution in the shopping experience arena. These technologies allow customers to try on clothes or visualize furniture in their homes virtually. It means embracing these technologies in staff training and facility planning for mall facility management. Innovative solutions to the Internet of Things are already becoming essential to remain relevant in the evolving retail landscape. It is already making shopping centers smarter and more efficient . From smart energy management systems to IoT-enabled inventory tracking, shopping malls across the Middle East have begun integrating these technologies into their infrastructure. To remain operational, shopping malls may need to reinvent themselves as experience centers, requiring flexible and efficient workforce management systems to support diverse operations. The Role of Training and Development All these emerging technologies require overhauling the training and development programs to be more inclusive and focused on emerging technologies. Training staff on new systems like face recognition time attendance is crucial for successful implementation. Successful training and development is not just about teaching employees how to use the new systems; it’s about helping them understand its benefits and addressing any concerns. An effective training program must: Be comprehensive, covering both system operation and underlying principles. Use comprehensive training methods, including a mix of hands-on practice, video tutorials, and written guides. Be a continuous program, with refresher courses and updates as the system evolves. Include training for managers on how to use the system’s data for decision-making. Shopping center management companies should invest in continuous staff development as it offers long-term benefits. It improves employee satisfaction and retention, enhances productivity, and ensures the facilities can fully leverage their technological investments. Leveraging Data for Strategic Decisions One of the by-products of advanced workforce management solutions is the vast amount of data they generate. Managers can make decisions proactively by leveraging the data generated by modern workforce management and attendance systems. When assimilated effectively, this data can provide valuable insights into employee productivity, peak operating hours, and staffing needs. The application of such data in strategic decision-making is multifaceted, particularly across three sectors: Predictive Scheduling: Analysing historical data can help predict busy periods and inform staffing decisions. Performance Management: Attendance patterns can highlight high-performing employees or those needing additional support. Cost Control: Accurate time-tracking data can help manage overtime costs and identify areas of potential savings. The Mall of the Emirates in Dubai is already leveraging data to improve foot traffic and decrease cost per visit using AI . The mall used Footprints AI’s indoor customer behavior data and AI technology to optimize its retailer mix and improve its digital ecosystem. Legal and Ethical Considerations One of the significant challenges of adopting face recognition technology is the legal and ethical considerations. In the Middle East, biometric data collection and use laws vary by country; for instance, in the UAE, Federal Decree-Law No. 45 of 2021 on Personal Data Protection i s implemented, which is different from the digital protection laws of other Emirates. To ensure compliance while implementing face recognition technology for shopping mall management: Obtain explicit consent from mall employees to collect and use their biometric data. Implement robust data security measures to ensure stored information is protected against cyber-attacks. Use the collected face recognition data only for its intended purpose (time and attendance tracking). Provide employees with access to their data and the right to request corrections. Additionally, the most common ethical considerations regarding such data include: Privacy concerns to ensure the system doesn’t infringe on employee privacy beyond its intended use. Fairness in implementation ensures that the system should work equally well for all employees, regardless of skin tone or facial features. Transparency in data collection and handling. Be open about how the system works and what data is collected. How does Truein help shopping centers and retail stores with Workforce Management and Time and Attendance tracking of employees?

How to Ensure Compliance with Labor Laws? October 7, 2024 To successfully build and grow your business, you need a workforce. And, if you are based in a rapidly evolving business region like the Middle East, ensuring compliance with labour laws is critical. It can be particularly challenging because the Middle East has a sophisticated law ecosystem due to overlapping regions. With this guide on labour law compliance, we will unravel the intricacies of labour law compliance and provide practical strategies for businesses to navigate the complex regulatory environment in the region. Labour compliance is not just the adherence to laws and regulations but sets the standards that govern the relationship between employers and employees. Ensuring workers’ rights, fair compensation, and safe working conditions benefits employers and employees. For employers, it ensures a reduced risk of legal disputes and associated costs while creating a more robust corporate reputation and brand image. For employees, it protects their fundamental rights, ensures proper compensation and benefits, and ensures a sustainable work-life balance.

Conclusion Overview of Labour Laws in the GCC While sharing many resources and infrastructure similarities, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have distinct labour laws. It is based on their unique cultural, economic, and social contexts. For businesses, it is essential to understand the specific regulations in each country where they operate for compliance. Critical Regulations in the Region As the regulations differ among GCC states, we list some of the critical rules that business owners must know in each region. United Arab Emirates (UAE) The UAE’s Labour Law Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021 governs employment relationships, covering working hours, leave entitlements, and end-of-service benefits. It has been updated with Federal Decree-Law No. 9 of 2024 , which enhances the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratization’s (MOHRE) powers, streamlines labour dispute resolution, and imposes stricter penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, maternity leave has been extended to 60 days—45 fully paid and 15 half-paid Saudi Arabia In Saudi Arabia, all businesses must adhere to the Saudi Labour Law Royal Decree No. M/51 , implemented in 2005 and updated in 2021. It covers employment contracts, Saudization, and worker protection. The law regulates employment conditions, including nationalisation quotas, with Saudization (Nitaqat) requiring a certain percentage of local citizens to be employed. Qatar Qatar has one of the most diverse workforces in the world, with the majority of the working class comprising expatriates. Qatar’s Labour Law No. 14 of 2004 applies to one of the most diverse workforces globally. Recent amendments in 2021 improved worker rights, including minimum wage increases and job change flexibility. The law addresses employment termination and labour disputes. Differences in Labour Laws Across Middle Eastern Countries GCC countries have the most common principles in their labour laws, but notable differences can profoundly impact your business’ compliance. It includes: Working Hours: In the UAE, the workweek is 48 hours , with some industries adopting a 4.5-day workweek . Other GCC countries have similar caps but different overtime rules. Nationalisation Policies: When hiring foreign workers, businesses must consider each country’s unique requirements. Also, there are varying requirements for employing local citizens, e.g., Emiratisation, Saudization, and Qatarization. End-of-Service Benefits: While there is a similarity in the legal framework regarding pay, overtime, and working hours, calculation methods and eligibility criteria for end-of-service benefits differ across countries. Leave Entitlements: Maternity, annual, and sick leave allowances vary across countries. The UAE provides 60 days of maternity leave, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar offer 70 and 50 days , respectively. Probation Periods: The maximum allowed probation period differs among GCC nations. For instance, Qatar allows a minimum probationary period of 2 weeks, while for Saudi Arabia and UAE, it is 90 days. Why Are Labour Laws Established? Labour laws are fundamental to establishing a fair work environment where labour is compensated fairly and provided a work-life balance. Some of the key reasons why labour laws are based include: Worker Protection: In diverse economies like the Middle East, ensuring compliance with labour laws is essential to safeguard employees from exploitation and ensure fair treatment. Economic Stability: Labour laws protect the financial stability of employees, employers, and the economy. Social Justice: Labour laws ensure equality in workforce management and no discrimination prevails in the workplace. Productivity Enhancement: Adherence to labour laws sets the standards that foster a productive and efficient work environment. Conflict Resolution: These laws provide legal mechanisms for resolving disputes between employers and employees. National Development: Labour laws serve a broader purpose by aligning workforce practices with national economic and social goals. Core Areas of Compliance Businesses can ensure labour compliance by diligently addressing the core areas of compliance. Here are the key areas of labour law compliance employers must focus on: Wage and Overtime Regulations This segment includes everything from minimum wage requirements to adherence to agreed-upon compensation structures. Businesses must create policies associated with timely payment of salaries and proper calculation and payment of overtime. Working Hours and Rest Periods Compliance with maximum working hours daily and weekly is essential to ensure work-life balance. Companies must create and implement provisions for required rest breaks during workdays, observance of weekly rest days, and special considerations for Ramadan working hours. Leave Entitlements (Annual, Sick, Maternity, Paternity) The provision of statutory annual leave is a core component of labour laws in the GCC. Employers must communicate their sick leave policies and documentation requirements with the employees. Leave policies must include maternity, paternity, and special entitlements (e.g., Hajj leave, study leave). Termination and End-of-Service Benefits Adherence to notice period requirements is another core requirement for ensuring compliance with labour laws. End-of-service benefits are also crucial for compliance, including gratuity, termination procedures, and handling of employee resignations and contract terminations. Health and Safety Requirements Maintaining safe working conditions is an innate compliance requirement. It requires employers to provide necessary safety equipment and training to workers. Furthermore, implementing occupational health programs and addressing workplace accidents and injuries is essential for labour compliance. Data Privacy Protecting employee personal information is essential for compliance with data protection laws under labour laws. It involves companies securely storing and handling employee records and obtaining necessary consent for data processing. Challenges in Compliance Labour law compliance comes with some challenges that businesses in the Middle East must proactively address for smooth compliance. Language and Cultural Barriers The Middle East has a diverse workforce, which presents the challenges of handling personnel with multiple languages and cultural backgrounds. There can be potential misunderstandings in policies and regulations without measures to overcome language or cultural barriers. Rapidly Evolving Regulations GCC countries frequently update labour laws and regulations to keep up with international labour laws and globalisation. For employers, it is challenging to stay informed about the latest changes. Managing a Diverse Workforce Balancing local employment quotas with expatriate workforce needs can take time and effort. Businesses must address the varying expectations and work cultures to ensure workers feel pretty treated regardless of nationality. Overcoming these labour compliance challenges requires ongoing education and a commitment to fostering an inclusive work environment. Practical Steps for Ensuring Compliance Ensuring compliance with labour laws becomes easier if you know the practical steps you can implement within your organisation. Start with these strategies: Conduct Regular Audits Your organisation’s HR practices and policies will require periodic internal audits. Hiring external auditors with expertise in Middle Eastern economies can help with unbiased compliance assessments. Address any identified compliance gaps promptly and systematically. Train Managers and HR Teams Compliance adherence becomes easier when management is aware of labour laws and compliance requirements. Provide comprehensive training to managers and HR teams on regulatory changes and their implications to develop a culture of compliance throughout the organisation. Utilise an Employee Agreement & Handbook When documented, labour laws, company policies, and regulatory requirements run into hundreds of pages. Create an employee handbook that communicates company policies and procedures in an easy-to-understand language. Also, clear, comprehensive employment contracts that align with local laws should be created. Implement Clear Policies and Procedures Once you have created and communicated well-defined policies for all aspects of employment, the next obvious step is to implement these policies consistently. A workforce management solution like Truein can help with implementation. Document Policies and Procedures Maintain detailed records of all HR policies and procedures. It includes employee-related documents such as promotions and disciplinary measures. Ensure all documentation is organised and readily available for inspections. Know Which Labour Laws Affect Your Business As we discussed, labour laws can vary widely, so stay informed about industry-specific regulations applicable to your business. Understand the implications of company size and structure on legal obligations to ensure compliance. Maintain Accurate Records of Compliance Maintenance Labour compliance requires employers to keep detailed logs of compliance activities and audits. A system for tracking the documentation related to policy updates and corrective actions will help enforce compliance. Engage Legal Experts Consult with local labour law specialists for complex issues, and we recommend retaining legal counsel for ongoing compliance support. Hiring laws with expertise in the field will ensure your organisation complies continuously with the labour laws. Using Technology to Enhance Compliance It’s the digital age, with technologies like AI and the cloud helping businesses thrive irrespective of location. Businesses in the Middle East can leverage technology to ensure labour law and compliance requirements are met. Here are the solutions you can consider to streamline your compliance efforts: HR and Payroll Software Solutions Consider implementing integrated HR management systems that automate compliance-related tasks. These systems can check compliance at every operation step with minimal human intervention. Also, modern payroll software can help with accurate calculations related to wages, overtime, and benefits by local laws. Attendance Management Tools Ensuring compliance with labour laws requires accurately tracking work hours, overtime, leave, etc. Utilise advanced time tracking systems like Truein to record working hours and overtime accurately. These modern attendance management tools use face recognition and mobile-based attendance solutions for precise time logging. By incorporating these technological solutions, businesses in the Middle East can significantly reduce non-compliance risk while improving efficiency in HR operations. Government Role and Labour Inspections The government plays a crucial role in enforcing labour law compliance. All businesses operating in the Middle East must be aware of government activities such as labour inspections and non-compliance penalties. Labour Inspections and Penalties for Non-Compliance Middle Eastern governments have strict regimens in the context of compliance enforcement. Regulatory bodies actively enforce labour compliance through regular inspections and potential penalties for non-compliance. Employers must be ready for: Unannounced visits by labour inspectors to workplaces Random review of employee records, contracts, and workplace conditions If found violating the labour laws, offenders can face penalties ranging from fines to business closure for severe violations. Also, non-compliant companies can be blocked from government services. Preparing for Labour Inspections To remain compliant and prepared for government inspections and avoid penalties, businesses should: Document every employment-related activity accurately Maintain up-to-date and easily accessible employee records Regularly review and update company policies to align with current laws Conduct mock inspections to identify and address potential compliance issues Provide training to staff on how to interact with labour inspectors professionally These proactive steps will demonstrate the business’s commitment to labour compliance and minimise the risk of penalties. Legal Resources for Employers Here are some of the legal resources employers can use to stay informed and compliant: Online Government Portals and Resources: United Arab Emirates Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation Helpful Resources for UAE Businesses State of Qatar’s Ministry of Labour website Saudi Arabia Ministry of Human Resource and Social Development Legal Advisory Services: https://legalconsultantuae.ae/ https://mbgcorp.legal/ https://legaladviceme.com/ How does Truein help with Labour Law Compliance?

How Advanced Workforce Management Solutions Can Transform Hospitality Operations in the Middle East? August 29, 2024 The Middle East is diversifying itself into a crucial component of the global economy by shifting its reliance on the oil and chemical industry. In this approach, the countries in the region are transforming into tourist destinations and other sectors as part of their economic diversification strategy. This is impacting the hospitality industry the most. From luxury resorts in Dubai to cultural heritage sites in Saudi Arabia, the industry has become a cornerstone of tourism and economic development. However, with this growth comes the challenge of managing an increasingly complex and diverse workforce. Efficient workforce management is crucial in the hospitality industry. When customer satisfaction and operational excellence are paramount for your business success, you must ensure processes are in place to ensure smooth operations. This is why workforce management for hospitality is critical. Proper hospitality workforce management is the difference between a thriving establishment and one that needs help to meet guest expectations. Here, we explore how workforce management solutions in the hospitality industry give the ability to schedule staff, manage resources, and optimize productivity effectively. Table of Contents The Current State of Workforce Management in Middle Eastern Hospitality Why should one consider advanced workforce management solutions? Optimized Workforce Scheduling in Operations Management Integration with Existing Systems Benefits of smooth data integration and system interoperability Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity Better Employee Satisfaction and Retention Improved Resource Allocation Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management Data-Driven Insights Implementing Advanced Workforce Management Solutions 1. Select an appropriate workforce management solution based on: 2. Specialised Workforce Management Software for Hospitality 3. Training and Support Needs 4. Cost Considerations 5. Customization and Scalability 6. Monitoring and Evaluation Future Trends in Workforce Management for Hospitality Remote and Flexible Work Trends How does Truein help with Hospitality Workforce Management in the Middle East? Conclusion The Current State of Workforce Management in Middle Eastern Hospitality The hospitality industry in the Middle East is highly dynamic with such a high influx of foreigners. The workforce operations and scheduling also have some unique challenges in the sector due to cultural differences. These workforce scheduling in operations management challenges are further compounded by the industry’s inherent characteristics, such as 24/7 operations, seasonal fluctuations, and the need for diverse skill sets. Another pressing issue of hospitality workforce management in the Middle East is the high turnover rate. This is particularly challenging as most of the hospitality sector workforce is comprised of ex-pats. In the absence of enough local workforce, turnover can be a crippling factor for any hospitality establishment. According to a study by TFG Management , the average turnover rate in the Middle East cities like Dubai’s hospitality sector is around 30%. This attrition rate is significantly higher than the global average. Without immaculate workforce management for hospitality in the region, restaurants and hotels will face a constant churn of employees. This will pressure HR departments to recruit, train, and integrate new staff members continuously. However, these are only some of the factors posing workforce management challenges in the Middle Eastern hospitality sector. Some other factors include: Seasonal demand fluctuations High turnover rate Complex shift patterns and scheduling requirements Compliance with labor laws and regulations Managing a diverse, multicultural workforce Balancing cost control with service quality Another distinguishing factor of workforce management in the Middle East is the cultural and regulatory factors. For instance, the region’s unique workweek structure, with many countries observing Friday and Saturday as the weekend and religious observances such as Ramadan, necessitate adjustments in the work schedules and staffing levels. Additionally, the regulatory compliance requirements for each country in the Middle East can vary significantly. For example, the United Arab Emirates recently introduced new labor laws to improve work-life balance and employee rights. Such changes require hospitality businesses in the region to be agile and responsive in their workforce management practices. Why should one consider advanced workforce management solutions? Given the unique challenges faced in restaurant workforce management in the Middle East, it’s a no-brainer that only advanced workforce management solutions can overcome these challenges. There are several reasons to opt for such a workforce management solution: Optimized Workforce Scheduling in Operations Management Modern scheduling tools such as Truein can enhance operational effectiveness. These tools achieve this optimization by significantly automating the creation of complex schedules, considering factors such as employee skills, availability, and local labor laws. Due to their agile design and customizable features, such scheduling tools provide the flexibility to adjust schedules quickly in response to unexpected changes in demand or staff availability. For instance, according to Captera, businesses implementing modern workforce management solutions reduce the time spent on scheduling by 80% and improve labor cost management. Advanced workforce management software for hospitality differs from traditional hospitality management systems in several ways: It focuses specifically on employee management It provides deeper insights into workforce productivity and performance. These solutions can often integrate with existing hospitality management systems They create an ecosystem of a more comprehensive operational overview. Interestingly, many of these solutions are based on the core principles of manufacturing scheduling, where lean management and just-in-time scheduling are critical. Integration with Existing Systems Modularity and compatibility are other advantages of modern workforce management solutions. It gives them the ability to integrate seamlessly with other business systems. Modern workforce management solutions like Truein can seamlessly integrate with payroll systems, ensuring accurate and timely wage calculations. It reduces errors and improves employee satisfaction. They also integrate with existing HR systems, aiding onboarding, training, and performance management processes. Furthermore, their operational system integration provides real-time data on business needs, allowing for more responsive workforce management. Benefits of smooth data integration and system interoperability Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity By automating routine tasks and providing data-driven insights, workforce management solutions can significantly boost operational efficiency. When employees and managers don’t have to log in time and attendance data manually, productivity can be improved considerably. Better Employee Satisfaction and Retention With effective workforce management solutions, hospitality establishments can improve employee satisfaction. For instance, self-service portals for shift swapping and time-off requests, mobile apps for easy access to schedules and communication, and fair and transparent scheduling practices can lead to higher job satisfaction and potentially reduce the high turnover rates. Improved Resource Allocation Advanced solutions provide managers with a detailed insight into labor costs and productivity. This allows managers in the industry to allocate resources more effectively, leading to significant cost savings without compromising service quality. Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management With built-in compliance and safety check features, such hospitality workforce management solutions help businesses comply with the regulatory and labor requirements in the Middle East. Data-Driven Insights One of the most valuable aspects of advanced workforce management solutions is their ability to provide actionable insights based on data analysis. The hospitality industry can significantly benefit from such data as it can be used for strategic decisions about staffing levels, training needs, and operational improvements. Implementing Advanced Workforce Management Solutions Planning the implementation of advanced workforce management solutions is essential. A botched-up implementation can curtail operations and derail schedules. Follow through these steps for effective implementation: 1. Select an appropriate workforce management solution based on: Scalability to accommodate future growth of your restaurant or hotel Compatibility with existing HR and payroll systems Customization options to meet the specific needs of your business User-friendliness for both managers and employees Robust reporting and analytics capabilities Conduct a thorough audit of current systems and processes to ensure that the workforce management software for the hospitality you are considering is compatible with existing systems. It will require the assistance of IT teams early in the planning process. Discuss the need for data migration and ensure data integrity. Additionally, a phased implementation of the workforce management solution should be considered to minimize disruption. If you are facing challenges like potential resistance from employees, try to: Communicate clearly and frequently about the reasons for change and expected benefits Involve employees in the implementation process to address their concerns Provide comprehensive training and support 2. Specialised Workforce Management Software for Hospitality Depending on your business model and requirements, you might require bespoke specialized workforce management software. This will require considering features such as: Flexible scheduling tools that can handle complex shift patterns Real-time time and attendance tracking Mobile accessibility for on-the-go management and employee self-service Advanced integration capabilities Compliance management features tailored to Middle Eastern labor laws Customized workforce management solutions offer several advantages for various hospitality settings. For instance, you can integrate it with room management systems to align staffing with occupancy rates. For several reasons, the hospitality industry is moving towards cloud-based solutions over on-premises solutions. While the cloud-based solutions have ongoing subscription fees, they are far more agile and customizable, which is only possible with on-premises solutions with custom development. You don’t have to manage any IT infrastructure as setup and data are in cloud storage. It makes cloud-based workforce management solutions far more scalable and flexible. However, cloud-based solutions’ data security and compliance needs are more complex. 3. Training and Support Needs Once you select an advanced workforce management solution for your establishment, create a comprehensive staff training program. Focus on role-specific training for managers, supervisors, and employees with hands-on practice sessions. Create a help desk that supports online knowledge bases and user forums. Feedback from employees at all levels must be encouraged to foster a culture of ongoing improvement and adaptability. 4. Cost Considerations Implementing advanced workforce management solutions can be a costly affair. However, in the long run, the investment is recovered in high employee retention and customer satisfaction. The cost involved in specialized hospitality workforce management software typically includes: Initial licensing or subscription costs Implementation and integration expenses Training and change management costs Ongoing support and maintenance fees When considering overall cost, do not just decide on face value but the return on investment (ROI) and long-term advantages. Consider labor cost savings through optimized scheduling and reduced administrative time for managers. Also, forecast the benefits of improved employee retention and reduced turnover costs. Also, enhanced customer satisfaction will lead to increased revenue. 5. Customization and Scalability Work closely with vendors if you need to tailor the solution to your unique operational requirements. Hotels can need customization, such as developing custom reports or dashboards for specific management needs. Customization can also be required to integrate with local systems or processes unique to the Middle East market. Whatever approach you take, there must be scope for scalability. Choose a solution that can easily accommodate increasing employees and locations. Prefer software vendors with a track record of continuous product development and improvement. It is better to opt for solutions that support modular add-ons for future expansion of capabilities. 6. Monitoring and Evaluation You must set clear milestones and KPIs for the implementation process to evaluate progress and monitor benefits. Regularly review the implementation progress against these benchmarks. It is better to use project management tools to keep implementation on track. To measure system effectiveness and efficiency: Monitor key metrics such as labor cost percentage and time to create schedules Compare pre- and post-implementation data to quantify improvements Use built-in analytics tools to identify areas of improvements That is not all; you will also need to make continuous adjustments to the implementation based on system performance. Also, regular surveys or focus groups should be conducted with employees and managers for feedback on needed improvements. Future Trends in Workforce Management for Hospitality Several emerging technologies will likely shape the future of workforce management in the Middle East hospitality sector. Just like every other sector, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning are making a headway into the industry. Establishments use such technologies for more accurate demand forecasting and innovative scheduling algorithms. For example, AI could analyze historical data, weather forecasts, and local events to predict staffing needs with unprecedented accuracy. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices such as smart meters, trackers, and smart room sensors could provide real-time data on guest movements and preferences. For instance, smart room sensors could alert housekeeping when a room is vacated, optimizing cleaning schedules. Remote and Flexible Work Trends There is also a shift towards remote work instead of traditionally on-site presence in the industry. Certain positions, such as reservations or customer service, may adopt hybrid models, combining on-site and remote work. How does Truein help with Hospitality Workforce Management in the Middle East?
