How does face attendance win over other biometric systems? June 21, 2024 Traditionally companies have used the thumb-based attendance system, which served as a good substitute to card-based systems. Neither of them were perfect and faced many setbacks on reliability and security. Attendance with face recognition has gained attention in recent years. While large companies have been quick to upgrade to face recognition attendance systems, many mid-sized organizations are still working with older technologies. Is it worthwhile to upgrade to face id attendance systems? Let’s evaluate the biometric systems objectively. Table of Contents How face recognition attendance system works? Why is face attendance better than thumb-based or fingerprint systems? Frequently asked questions: 1. Which biometric attendance system is more reliable and accurate? 2. Which biometric attendance system is more affordable? Make an informed decision How face recognition attendance system works? The system stores a database of faces. A screen, usually a mobile or tablet in case of Truein, is placed at the entrance and employees have to simply walk towards it. A match is triggered with the database and attendance is captured within a second. Systems like Truein are benchmarked with the eye so no amount of change in facial features or fashion accessories affects its ability to return accurate results. Why is face attendance better than thumb-based or fingerprint systems? 1. Practically 100% accuracy: Thumb-based attendance systems have often failed in situations where the fingerprint is faded. Workers who work in oiling systems can’t register their attendance with faded thumb prints. Similarly heena applications or cuts on fingers return errors. It is often frustrating to try attendance multiple times before simply writing down in a manual attendance register. That is not the case with face recognition attendance . It has been tried, tested and proven that it is practically 100% accurate. Employees simply walk towards it and attendance is captured. It works even when hairstyles change or employees age. 2. Touchless safety: With covid-19, the world has become increasingly aware of the risks of contact-based attendance systems. There is no attendance system, other than face id attendance system which is absolutely touchfree. The user has to simply show his face. The system is triggered automatically. Even after the world is covid-free, people will be conscious of the touches they make and it will be good to provide a hygienic system. 3. No complex hardware: Thumb based systems always require that you install a machine at the entrance. While the upfront costs are a barrier in itself, the machine requires maintenance too. When you choose a face attendance system like Truein, there is no complex machine. You simply install the application on any Android or iOS system and it works. Often, companies use just a tablet or mobile for Truein face attendance. 4. Remote access: Not every staff member steps into the office every day. There are remote workers or on-the-go field staff who report directly to client offices, distributor’s godown or other places. If you have rigid systems that require machines or hardware, it won’t work out for remote workers. With Truein mobile-based face recognition systems it is possible to allow on-the-go workers to take attendance from their own phone, wherever they are. Companies can restrict the mobile-based attendance to specific geographies , geo-fencing it, making it more secure and controlled. 5. Wow experience: With attendance time cut-down to a second and no action required from the user-end, face id attendance is by far the best biometric system. It wows employees who don’t require training and are happy to adopt immediately. When a face id system is based by a powerful application, it is even more welcome. Employees can track their records from the phone and managers can track everyone in real-time. 6. Reliability: Face recognition attendance systems like Truein have spoof-proof mechanisms. Employees may be required to blink their eyes before capturing attendance. It ensures no photos are used in the attendance process to mark proxies. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Frequently asked questions: 1. Which biometric attendance system is more reliable and accurate? Time and again it has been proven that fingerprint systems fail when fingers are dirty, oily, wet or bruised. Face attendance is practically 100% accurate. 2. Which biometric attendance system is more affordable? Thumb based systems require sensor-based machine installation at every site, making it costly in the beginning and also at the time of maintenance. With face attendance, any Android or iOS based mobile may be sufficient. Even employees can track their face ID with their own phone. Even retail stores with multiple outlets or construction companies with multiple sites find face attendance more affordable. Make an informed decision There are many choices available today. Not every finger print system or every face attendance system is made equal. Evaluate the options between various vendors or brands and make an informed choice. Be sure to ask questions like: Does the attendance system have geo-fencing? Does the system require hardware installation and maintenance? Does the system have mobile-based capabilities? Asking the right questions will help you choose the most advanced biometric attendance system.

How to make shift scheduling and job mapping a breeze? June 21, 2024 If you run an organization that requires workers to come in at different shifts, it can be a hassle to track their shifts and attendance. Often the HR or admin department uses a manual register to allocate shifts – morning, evening, general and so on. Staff often changes their shift based on personal situations too. It is difficult to sync that with attendance machines and there is a manual reconciliation required at the end of the month. The entire process is tedious and cumbersome, to say the least. If you’ve been suffering from this, you will be delighted to find an easy and technological solution. Table of Contents 1.Upgrade to Truein scheduling 2. Get the Truein job mapping feature Why should you link an attendance system with shift scheduling and job mapping features? Never again go the manual way 1.Upgrade to Truein scheduling The Truein facial recognition attendance system comes with a powerful web dashboard and advanced shift rostering features. Here is how it works: The admin can upload a spreadsheet with shift details for the entire staff in one go in the Truein dashboard Alternatively, the admin can assign shifts individually to every worker from the web dashboard The workers’ face attendance everyday will get mapped against their allocated shift It is also possible to schedule shifts automatically based on attendance. In other words, if a worker punches attendance during general shift timings, the system will automatically assign general shift to him. 2. Get the Truein job mapping feature If you activate job mapping, every worker will have to select his job ID at the time of attendance. If his job ID gets wrongly selected, the admin will have the rights to change it from the web dashboard. This ensures attendance is linked to job IDs. Why should you link an attendance system with shift scheduling and job mapping features? 1. Make it fool-proof: An attendance system has critical records about a worker’s in-time, out-time, hour clocked, leaves, overtime and so on. It is important from a compliances stand point and also from remuneration point of view. It should not be left to manual syncs and reconciliations. When you automate everything, you can be assured of an audit trail too. 2. Make it convenient: It is easy for everyone to view their allocated shifts through the Truein face attendance system. The admins can focus on the more important tasks and let Truein automatically allocate shifts or track assigned shifts. 3. Get powerful analytics: When you do job mapping and shift scheduling through the attendance system, you are recording critical data on a daily basis. It builds into our powerful analytics and reports. You can see insights around: How many workers are coming in their allocated shifts? Which shifts have least or most attendance? Which shifts have overtime issues? Which worker or department needs to be appreciated or warned? All of it can be viewed in real-time by the employer as well as the workers in the web dashboard or the mobile dashboard. Critical decisions need not wait until the end of the month; the organization can be more agile. 4. Meet compliance standards: Time tracking is an important legal requirement as well. Compensation may vary depending on shifts – night workers may have higher hourly pay for instance. The overtime rates may also vary based on shifts – weekend rates may be higher. All of this can be managed from one powerful Truein system. The time and location stamps are tamper-proof. They are not dependent on the user’s system but on our servers. So, they can be used for all audits. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account Never again go the manual way Truein face attendance system has been tried and tested by big brands across the country with large shift-based staff.

Streamline your attendance process PC Jewellers made their retail stores safe with touchless face attendance Customer Stories Sites 91 Staff 1000+ Country India Industry Retail/Distributed Stores About PC Jewellers PC Jewellers is a national retail chain in the jewelry industry. Their flagship store, located at Karol Bagh in Delhi, was opened in 2005. With more than 91 stores across India, PC Jewellers has made a remarkable journey. Being the most reputed player in the hallmarked jewelry market, they stand for trust and high-quality designs. Umesh Arya Head IT PC Jewellers Previously, we used a standalone attendance system at various sites, due to which tracking and reconciling records at a central level was tedious and error-prone. Once we implemented Truein in August 2020, attendance management became hassle-free, and all the required reports were available with a single click. The rollout was smooth, and all our 60+ stores in the major geographical regions of India went live within 2-3 days. We have around 1500 staff now using Truein. The touchless technology brings a sense of safety, and our staff finds the system very user-friendly. We have also set up attendance policies like break-time, overtime, etc., as per our requirements. Monthly timesheets and reports are generated with automated calculations based on the policies. The team has been very supportive in guiding and helping us whenever needed.

Umesh Arya Head IT Challenges Before the pandemic outbreak, PC Jewellers used a thumb-based attendance system at their large stores and maintained manual entries at their small stores. As a result, there was no way to sync records at the national level, leading to a lack of transparency. Besides, with the pandemic hitting hard, it was essential to implement a high level of safety to get their staff back to work. They wanted to bring in a foolproof and touchless attendance system that could: Be quickly rolled out nationwide without infrastructure challenges Provide accurate time and attendance, and enable the staff to mark their attendance easily without the need for any training Replicate the the reporting structure rightly in the solution, so that the right access is available to managers Help implement stringent retail store policies to ensure discipline on the following fronts: Late marks; Overtime; Shift timings Ensure attendance gets captured in remote locations that face frequent internet issues Solution PC Jewellers implemented the Truein attendance solution in record time across their stores. Truein offered them: Touchless face attendance for the safety of their staff Mobile based attendance , which required no hardware installation overheads Geo-fenced attendance to ensure attendance marking is done only at approved store locations Admin settings to replicate the detailed reporting structure in the solution. Site settings for location-wise holidays and other policies Do you want to know more ? Talk to us Watch a demo Result Truein made it possible to implement a cost-effective, safe, and accurate attendance solution across locations without cost or time barriers. With Truein, PC Jewellers got rid of their multiple attendance systems and had just one touchless attendance system nationwide. The convenience of the Truein mobile app made everything from taking attendance to viewing real-time reports easy. The geo-fencing feature allowed the staff to use their phones to mark attendance at approved locations. As the staff used their mobiles for attendance, no hardware costs had to be borne by the store. Every store had custom HR policies, yet data could be synced automatically at the national level. Remote stores that face internet issues could use Truein in offline mode to capture data, which gets synced when connectivity is restored. Companies with contract staff have saved 37% of revenue leakages simply by switching to new age Face recognition Time & Attendance .
