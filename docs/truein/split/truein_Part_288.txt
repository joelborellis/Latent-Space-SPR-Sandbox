Whether you are a restaurant or a manufacturing unit, if your business is based in Colorado, you must understand the laws that govern various aspects of time off, including vacation days, medical leave, and other circumstances that may require employees to take time away from work. Understanding Colorado PTO laws is beneficial for both employers and employees. That’s what this article is about. We explain various aspects of Colorado’s paid time off laws in detail. Table of Contents Does law in Colorado require PTO? Laws for various types of leaves in Colorado 1. Medical Leave 2. Jury duty leave 3. Voting 4. Military leave 5. Domestic violence 6. Sick leave What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Colorado PTO law? What happens to Roll Over (Carry Over, Brought Forward) Leaves? Colorado State Holidays for 2024 Payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination How much PTO can an employee carry over? How can Truein help with paid time-off management? Conclusion Does law in Colorado require PTO? While Colorado law does not mandate that employers provide paid vacation leave, it does have specific requirements for paid sick leave under the Colorado Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA). Employers can decide if they want to offer PTO and what type. However, when hiring, they must create transparent PTO policies and share them with the employees. These policies should address various aspects, such as accrual rates, carry-over limits, and payout rules. Employers in Colorado must communicate these policies to employees through employment contracts, handbooks, or other written materials to avoid misunderstandings. Laws for various types of leaves in Colorado Colorado has several laws and regulations governing various types of leaves that employees may be entitled to under specific circumstances. While there are no particular PTO laws, these regulations provide guidelines for companies to create policies that provide employees with the necessary time off when faced with specific life events or emergencies. 1. Medical Leave The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) applies for medical leave in Colorado. It is an application for all employers who employ 50 or more employees. Under FMLA, such companies should provide eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within 12 months for specific qualifying reasons. Medical leave is applicable for the birth/adoption of a child, caring for a seriously ill family member, or an employee’s serious health condition. In addition to the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Colorado has introduced its own Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Program , which will begin providing benefits starting in January 2024. This state program offers paid leave for: The birth or adoption of a child Caring for a seriously ill family member The employee’s own serious health condition Employees will be entitled to up to 12 weeks of paid leave under the FAMLI program. 2. Jury duty leave Colorado law prohibits employers from interfering with employees’ participation in jury duty. No employer can penalize employees summoned to serve on a jury, and they should pay regular wages of up to $50 a day for the first 3 days of jury duty. After 3 days, jury duty leave can be unpaid. 3. Voting Colorado law allows employees to take up to two hours of paid time off to vote in general elections. However, employers can choose when they take the time off to vote. Furthermore, an employee who takes at least 3 hours off work when polls are open is not eligible for 2 hours of paid time off. 4. Military leave Colorado follows the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which provides job protection and reemployment rights for employees who serve in the military. Under this law, an employee can take up to 5 years off work to serve in the military. When such an employee returns, the employer must rehire them in the same position. There cannot be any discrimination against them for their military service. Employees called to active state service in the Colorado National Guard are entitled to unlimited leave and reinstatement. Also, members of the U.S. military or the Colorado National Guard in Colorado may receive up to 15 days of unpaid leave per year for training. 5. Domestic violence Colorado Domestic Violence Leave Act requires companies with 50 or more employees to provide up to three days of unpaid leave per year to employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking or who have a family member who is a victim. Employers should provide employees seeking medical attention, counseling, legal assistance, or to address safety concerns with time off. 6. Sick leave Sick leave falls under the Colorado Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) . As per the law, employers have two types of paid sick leave for their employees: accrued leave and public health emergency (PHE) leave (not currently in effect). Employees can accrue up to 48 hours of paid sick leave per year at 1 hour of paid sick leave earned for every 30 hours worked. Employees can use sick leaves for their or a family member’s illness, injury, medical care, or preventive care. What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Colorado PTO law? Colorado PTO law does not mandate accrual, and it’s entirely at employers’ discretion to allow vacation time accrual. As Colorado does not have specific state laws that require the accrual rates or systems for vacation or PTO, employers in the state have the flexibility to establish their methods and rates of PTO accrual. They can also cap the vacation time earned. These caps are often set to prevent excessive accruals and may vary depending on the company’s policies. Employers can also specify when employees are eligible to start using their accrued vacation or PTO days. Additionally, in Colorado, accrued vacation or PTO must be paid out upon termination regardless of company policies What happens to Roll Over (Carry Over, Brought Forward) Leaves? Colorado is one of the rare states that prohibit employers from using the Use It or Lost It policy after the June 2021 judgment by the high court . In the state, any accrued but unused vacation days from one year must be allowed to carry over into the new year. Employees cannot be forced to use their vacation days within a specific time frame, often by the end of the calendar year. They can roll over the accrued PTO to next year if they do not use these days within the designated period. However, employers may limit how many days can be carried over. For example, an employer may permit employees to carry over up to five unused vacation days from one year to the next. Colorado State Holidays for 2024 Here is a tentative list of state holidays in Colorado in 2024. Please note that the holidays falling on a Sunday are observed on Monday, and those falling on a Saturday are observed on Friday. Date Holiday January 1 New Year’s Day 3rd Monday in January Martin Luther King Birthday, Jr. Day 3rd Monday in February President’s Day Last Monday in May National Memorial Day July 4 Independence Day 1st Monday in September Labor Day 1st Monday in October Frances Xavier Cabrini Day November 11 Veterans Day 4th Thursday in November Thanksgiving December 25 Christmas Day Payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination The payment of accrued, unused vacation or paid time off (PTO) upon termination is mandatory per the Colorado paid time off laws. These laws mandate employers to provide a payout for accrued but unused vacation or PTO upon an employee’s termination. However, unpaid sick leave doesn’t have to be paid at termination. No employer can establish policies regarding the payment of accrued, unused vacation or PTO that prevent payout upon an employee’s termination. The same should be outlined in the company’s employment contracts, employee handbooks, or other written materials. Colorado PTO payout laws mandate that an employer pay out PTO within 14 days of receiving the employee’s written demand. Failure to comply with this timeline makes the employer liable to pay double the amount of unpaid PTO or up to 10 days of the employee’s average daily wages starting from the date of receiving the written demand, whichever amount is more significant. If the failure to pay is willful, the penalty can be increased by 50%. Employers not responding to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage complaint for unpaid wages of up to $7,500 will be issued a citation, a notice of assessment for the amount owed, and penalties. How much PTO can an employee carry over? Colorado Wage Act governs policies regarding PTO carry-over. While it mandates PTO payout upon separation from employment, it doesn’t specifically address the issue of carry-over from year to year. Therefore, the employer’s policies typically determine how much paid time off an employee can carry over from one year to the next. Employers can limit the carry-over days based on their company’s needs and practices. For example, Apple only allows to carry over up to 10 days of unused vacation time for eligible employees. These policies are also significantly affected by employee tenure and seniority. How can Truein help with paid time-off management?

Employers must know these leave provisions, as they provide essential protections and rights in various personal and civic situations. A) Virginia required leave 1. Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) Virginia doesn’t have its own state family and medical leave policies, and it follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). According to the rule, every employer with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius should allow employees to take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave in 12 months. Employees can ask for leave under FMLA for specific family or medical reasons that include: Birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child. Medical emergency facing an immediate family member.

Employers cannot make an employee who serves four or more hours on jury duty work on a shift starting 5 p.m. on the same day or before 3 a.m. the following day. Jury duty leave allows employees to fulfill their civic duty, and employers cannot terminate or penalize employees for taking jury duty leave. 3. Witness leave Employees who testify in court as witnesses should be granted leave. However, when appearing as a witness when subpoenaed, employees should inform their employers beforehand. Witness leave can be compensated or unpaid, depending on the company policies. Additionally, witness leave should not come from sick leave or any other type of earned leave. Virginia requires employers to grant witness leave, ensuring employees can participate in legal proceedings without jeopardizing their employment. 4. Crime Victim Leave Virginia provides leave to employees who are victims of certain crimes and need to address related issues. Employers must allow employees who are crime victims to leave, although they can ask for proof from the concerned law enforcement agency. This leave can be paid or unpaid and may include: Attending court hearings. Seeking medical or psychological treatment. Participating in law enforcement proceedings. 5.

Employees should be given the same positions, promotions, and other benefits when they return to work. Additionally, members of the Civil Air Patrol can get an additional 10 days per year for training and 30 days per year for responding to duty. This ensures that these individuals can serve their country without adverse employment consequences. (B) Virginia Non-Required Leave 1. Sick leave Apart from the FMLA-mandated leave scheme, employers in Virginia are not required to offer either paid or unpaid sick leave. However, most employers choose to provide employees with sick leave as a benefit. If the employer offers, the sick leave policies can depend on their requirements and choices. However, employers must commit to the policies if offered as a benefit. 2. Vacation leave There are no state-mandated vacation leave requirements in Virginia. Employers have full discretion to decide whether to offer vacation leave and the policies regarding these leaves. The provision of vacation leave, its accrual rate, and usage policies are typically determined by individual employers and may vary between employers. 3. Holiday leave Virginia doesn’t mandate employers to provide employees unpaid or paid holiday leave. In the absence of any specific laws regarding paid holidays, paid time off for holidays is typically a matter of employer policy. 4. Voting leave According to Virginia’s paid time off laws, employers should permit employees to take up to two hours of paid leave to vote in any federal, state, or local election. Employers may decide when employees take time off during their work hours. 5. Bereavement leave Bereavement leave is not mandated by Virginia law. However, some employers in Virginia may offer this type of leave to employees in case a family member or loved one dies. Policies regarding such leave should be included in employee contracts and handbooks. (C) Other Types of Leaves 1. Maternity, Paternity, & FMLA Virginia provides provisions for maternity and paternity leave for new parents. Employers in the state must follow FMLA guidelines to provide eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for various family and medical reasons. All eligible employees can avail of maternity or paternity leave in situations involving a child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement. This leave ensures that new parents, both mothers and fathers, can take unpaid leave to bond with their newborn or adopted child without risking their job security. 2. Military leave Military leave in Virginia extends the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) provisions. It provides job protection and specific benefits to employees serving in the military or the National Guard. Employees called to active duty or training can continue getting health care benefits for up to 24 months during military leave. Additionally, such employees can avail up to 5 years of unpaid leave for military service. Employers are generally prohibited from terminating or penalizing employees due to their military service. 3. Pregnancy disability leave While Virginia does not have a separate pregnancy disability leave law, employees can still get leave for pregnancy-related medical conditions that may be covered under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Employers can provide pregnancy disability leave to employees for pregnancy-related medical conditions, such as complications or recovery from childbirth. FMLA ensures pregnant employees have job protection and access to necessary medical leave during pregnancy and postpartum. What is the accrual vacation system of employers in Virginia PTO law? Virginia paid time off laws do not mandate any accrual vacation system but are widely used by employers. Employers in Virginia have the flexibility to decide their methods of vacation accrual. It can be hourly, daily, weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly, usually aligning with the company’s pay cycle. Employers can also specify caps on vacation leave accrual in Virginia. All provisions addressing the payout of accrued, unused vacation on termination should be mentioned in company policies, contracts, and employee handbook. This means that individual company policies largely determine policies around accrual and payout. What happens to Roll Over (Carry Over, Brought Forward) Leaves? In Virginia, employers are not forbidden to use or lose the policy regarding the rollover (carry over or brought forward) of leaves. As there are Virginia paid time off laws regulation rollover, it’s at the employer’s discretion to decide whether or not to allow employees to carry over unused vacation leaves to the following year. Each company can set its policy about carryover. To ensure that employees accrue only a few leaves, they can include rules or limits on how much leave can be carried over. Also, employers should encourage employees to take PTO regularly to balance rollover. Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination In Virginia, the payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination is primarily governed by the policies set by individual employers as no specific state laws mandate the payment of new vacation time upon termination. Employers have full discretion to establish their policies regarding the payout of accrued vacation. Employers can implement a “use it or lose it” policy to ensure employees must use their accrued vacation time within a specified timeframe or forfeit their unused days and receive no compensation upon termination. Employers may set caps on the maximum number of vacation days employees can accrue. This approach aims to prevent employees from accumulating excessive vacation time. Overtime pay in Virginia Virginia doesn’t have state overtime law and follows the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) federal law for overtime calculation. The FLSA mandates that non-exempt employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek must receive overtime pay at one and a half times their regular pay rate for each hour worked beyond the 40-hour threshold. This rule does not cover salaried executive, administrative, or professional employees. While employers can set their own wage rates, they cannot be lower than the federal minimum wage, $7.25 per hour. Breaks and rest periods in Virginia Virginia labor law does not require private sector employers to provide their employees with specific rest or meal breaks. However, employers must determine break and rest period policies that ensure a healthy work environment. The availability and duration of meal and rest breaks vary widely among employers. Many employers choose to offer breaks as a matter of policy, recognizing that providing employees with an opportunity to rest and eat can contribute to productivity and employee well-being. Individuals under 16 must be offered 30 minutes break for every five hours worked. It is mandated by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The FSLA and Virginia House Joint Resolution 145 mandate that employers provide unpaid break time and a suitable arrangement for breastfeeding or milk expression.
