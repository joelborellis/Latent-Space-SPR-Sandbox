Conclusion Tipped Worker Rules and Tip Pooling Pennsylvania has many establishments in the service industry that employ many tipped workers—Pennsylvania’s regulations regarding tipped workers and tip pooling aim to protect the earnings of tipped employees. Clarification on ownership of tips and gratuities paid via non-cash methods As per law, in Pennsylvania, the tips and gratuities belong to the employees who receive them, regardless of whether they are paid through cash or non-cash, such as credit card payments. Therefore, tips given by customers are the property of the tipped employees, and employers are prohibited from withholding or retaining any portion of these tips for themselves. Prohibition of employers deducting processing fees from employee tips The Department of Labor clearly states that no employer can deduct any sort of processing fee from employee tips for credit cards or another mode of payment . Under no condition can an employer deduct any processing fee, ensuring that all employees receive total compensation and all tips. Guidelines for forming tip pools A tip pool can include all employees who receive the minimum wage of $7.25 per state and federal rules. However, tip pools can only have individuals who receive regular tips. It can include non-tipped employees if they also receive the state-determined minimum wage. Managers, supervisors, or employers are strictly prohibited from receiving tips from the tip pools. However, these individuals can contribute to the tip tools. These employees can receive tips from the patrons if they provide the entire service without assistance. Understanding Definitions and Requirements for Tipped Employees Tipped employees are the ones who receive regular tips in addition to hourly wages. To be considered a tipped employee, an individual must earn at least $135 monthly tips. As per the regulations, employers must ensure that tipped employees earn at least $7.25 per hour, including the base hourly wage and tips. If a tip-credited employee earns less than $7.25 per hour, the employer must make the difference to comply with the Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act. Comprehending Federal Overtime Regulations: Ensuring Worker Protection and Compliance Understanding federal overtime regulations is crucial for employers to ensure compliance and protect the rights of their workers. Act 70, effective July 9, 2021 , is one of the most essential overtime regulations. Insight into Federal Overtime Regulations The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) governs federal overtime regulations in all states in the United States. Pennsylvania doesn’t have any state law for overtime, so it implements FLSA as per the overtime rules for all employers. Under overtime regulations as per the FLSA, all non-exempt employees are entitled to receive overtime pay at least 1.5 times their regular pay rate for all hours worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek. Irrespective of the industry, employers must provide all non-exempt employees overtime pay and accurate compensation. There are guidelines for determining employee eligibility for overtime pay, including classifications as exempt or non-exempt and specific criteria for exemption status. Employers must familiarize themselves with the provisions of Act 70 to ensure compliance with the latest federal overtime regulations. Guidance on Compliance in Case of Conflicts If there is a conflict between the state and federal laws regarding overtime, employers are advised to follow the regulation that provides maximum protection to workers. For instance, if there is a conflict in deciding the appropriate overtime pay rates for your employees due to a conflict of the laws, choose the federal or state law depending on which provides higher overtime pay rates or broader eligibility criteria. However, employers must seek legal counsel for clarification on the appropriate course of action. Employers can ensure maximum worker protection by prioritizing compliance with state and federal regulations. Overview of Pennsylvania Overtime Laws Pennsylvania’s overtime law aligns with federal law, allowing all non-exempt employees to earn overtime at 1.5 times the regular wage rate. Such employees are eligible for overtime beyond a 40-hour workweek. For employers, it is essential to understand the eligibility, rate, and other criteria for overtime payment. Eligibility Criteria All employers in Pennsylvania are required to pay most hourly employees overtime. Salaried employees are primarily exempt, but a few categories of salaried employees can be eligible for overtime pay as per state and federal law. Additionally, the eligibility for overtime pay is determined based on the number of hours worked in a workweek. Employees are entitled to overtime pay at one and a half times their regular pay rate for hours worked beyond 40. Calculation for Overtime in Pennsylvania For hourly employees: Hourly employees should be paid time and a half for hours over 40 work hours/week. Hourly employees receiving bonus or commission: Overtime calculation for such employees is made based on this formula= {((Total hours x Hourly Rate) + Commission) / Total hours} / 2 For salaried employees: For eligible salaried employees, the overtime pay is made per regulation, i.e., 1.5 times the regular page for the overtime hours. Exemptions: Certain salaried employees are exempted from overtime requirements under Pennsylvania law. According to Pennsylvania’s overtime law, here is a complete list of those exempt from overtime requirements . Some of the exempted employees include: Specially skilled employees like computer workers Agricultural workers Seasonal employees Executives Administrative Professional employees making at least $684 per week Highly compensated employees However, these exemptions are narrowly construed; you must check the specific criteria outlined in state and federal regulations to qualify for exemption status. The above rules and exemptions are a mixture of the overtime laws determined by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and federal laws. Employers in the state can provide more benefits and rights contained in the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, but not less. Special Rules for Tipped Employees and Alternate Work Schedules According to Pennsylvania overtime laws, a tipped employee has to earn tips of $135 per month to be exempted from overtime. They are eligible for the tip credit if they earn less than this. Therefore, if you employ tipped employees, you must check if they receive a significant portion of their income from gratuities. Then, you can make changes to the employment policies as necessary. Also, the 80/20 rule applies to tipped employees. The rule stipulates that tipped employees must spend at least 80% of their time performing tipped duties directly related to customer service. They can pay 20% of the time on non-tipped duties, such as side work or cleaning. Non-customer tasks must be at most 20% of the employee’s total work time to be eligible for tipped employee benefits. Alternate Work Schedules (AWS) An alternate work schedule is also known as a flexible or compressed work schedule. It is entirely up to the employees’ discretion to provide AWS to employees. Eligibility for AWS typically depends on employer policies and agreements negotiated with employees or labor unions. Under a compressed work schedule, employees can complete the 80-hour work in less than ten work days. Flexible work schedules allow employees to deviate from a specified arrival and departure time but must be present for core work. AWS may allow for longer shifts without triggering overtime pay until a certain threshold of hours worked in a workweek is met. Clarifications on Exemptions and Daily Overtime Limits As mentioned, certain occupations are exempt from overtime pay requirements under state and federal law. It mainly includes certain types of salaried employees, professionals, and certain seasonal workers. For employers, it is mandatory to review exemption criteria carefully to ensure compliance with regulations. Unlike some states, Pennsylvania does not impose daily overtime limits. Instead, overtime pay is typically calculated based on hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. This means that employers can independently decide the overtime hours for the employees. However, it is recommended that employers maintain a balanced schedule for employee overtime. How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management?

These laws govern the allocation, accrual, and usage of paid time off for employees, encompassing vacation, sick, and other types of leave. Employers must comply with the various PTO laws in their policies to ensure fair treatment of employees, maintain productivity, and avoid legal liabilities. Effective management of PTO benefits both employers and employees, which is why employers must meet their legal obligations. This comprehensive guide on New Mexico PTO law provides employers with details of various laws, emphasizing the importance of compliance. Table of Contents Vacation Leave Quota Accruals Rollover of accrued PTO Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay New Mexico Laws on Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination New Mexico Sick Leave Policy New Mexico Paid Sick Law Maternity, Paternity and FMLA Leave Provisions Bereavement Leave Jury Duty Leave Military Leave Voting Leave New Mexico State Holidays in 2024 How can Truein help with paid time off management? Conclusion Vacation Leave Quota As of 2024, New Mexico PTO law doesn’t mandate private employers to offer vacation leave to employees. The state does not require any vacation leave quota, leaving it to employers to define their policies, so the decision is at their discretion. However, if an employer offers paid or unpaid vacation leave, the policies should be communicated and consistently applied to all employees. Employees must be informed about policies governing the accrual, usage, and payment of accrued leave upon termination. Accruals PTO accruals refer to the accumulation of paid time off based on an employee’s length of service and hours worked. In New Mexico, PTO accruals are not mandatory, but still, most employers allow employees to accrue PTO, typically based on factors such as years of service or hours worked. The employer must permit accrual per pay period, monthly, or yearly. Employers also have the freedom to cap vacation accrual. Employers must communicate the accrual method and rates to employees and ensure accurate tracking of accrued PTO to prevent misunderstandings or disputes. Rollover of accrued PTO New Mexico is one of the states allowing a use-it-or-lose-it policy. Employers can prevent employees from carrying over accrued PTO to the following year. In the absence of any rollover provision in New Mexico PTO law, the policies regarding the rollover or carryover of accrued but unused PTO from one year to the next, if allowed, depend on employer policies. Employers may implement rollover provisions to incentivize employees to use their accrued PTO responsibly while accommodating fluctuations in staffing needs throughout the year. Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay The state has no statutory provisions as accrued vacation time is not treated as wages. New Mexico PTO law does not mandate employers to offer accrued vacation time or pay for unused PTO within a specified timeframe after an employee’s termination. New Mexico Laws on Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination Payment of accrued, unused vacation time on termination is not mandatory. As the state doesn’t require employers to offer paid or unpaid vacation time, there is no provision to make employers pay for unused PTO upon termination. However, if an employer in New Mexico has a policy allowing employees to accrue vacation time, unused vacation time is considered wages. In such a scenario, New Mexico PTO law requires employers to pay employees for accrued, unused vacation time upon termination. New Mexico Sick Leave Policy New Mexico follows the federal guidelines for sick leave. Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), all eligible employees must be allowed 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. The eligible employees are the individuals who: Employed with the current employer for at least 12 months or worked 1,250 hours in the previous year Works at a location with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius Employees can use unpaid sick leave to attend to a family member’s personal or medical needs due to injury, mental illness, maternity, or paternity requirements. FMLA sick leave is unpaid. New Mexico Paid Sick Law The New Mexico Paid Sick Leave Law, which took effect on July 1, 2022, mandates that employers should provide paid sick leave to all employees (part-time, seasonal, and temporary ones) for their own or a family member’s illness, medical appointments, or other covered reasons. Employers must ensure compliance with the accrual rate of 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Employees can also carry over unused paid sick leave to the following year. However, employers can cap paid sick time to 64 hours annually. Furthermore, it is not mandatory to pay unused or paid sick leave on termination. By offering paid sick leave, employers can demonstrate their commitment to employee wellness and mitigate the spread of illness in the workplace. In Bernalillo County, New Mexico, all employers with more than two employees should allow employees to accrue 1 hour of paid leave for every 32 hours worked. This leave can be up to 56 hours in 3 years and used for any purpose. Maternity, Paternity and FMLA Leave Provisions In New Mexico, while there are no state-specific laws for paid maternity or paternity leave, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) applies. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with job-protected leave for birth and care of a newborn child and adoption or foster care placement. It allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for maternal or paternal requirements. In addition to FMLA, New Mexico also follows the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) to protect the rights of pregnant women. As per the act, employers cannot discriminate against pregnant employees or make decisions about their hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, etc. In addition to the federal laws, New Mexico also has the New Mexico Human Rights Act mandating all employers with four or more employees to treat pregnancy as any other medical condition, and there should be no discrimination due to pregnancy, childbirth, or other pregnancy-related medical conditions. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave in New Mexico is not mandated by state law and depends on the employer’s discretion. However, most employers offer bereavement leave when an employee experiences the death of a family member. Typically, the leave offered is two days and is unpaid. The policies regarding bereavement leave, such as duration and eligibility, depend on the employers’ policies and should be outlined in the employee handbook or employment contracts. Employers who offer bereavement leave often see it as a way to provide support and compassion to their employees during difficult times. Jury Duty Leave All employers must offer unpaid jury duty leave, providing employees the necessary time off to fulfill their civic obligations as jurors. Employees should be allowed to serve on a jury without fear of retaliation or adverse employment actions from employers. Employers cannot penalize or discriminate against employees for serving on jury duty or make them use sick leave, vacation time, or other accrued PTO for jury duty. This leave must be provided to full-time and part-time employees, regardless of their length of service or tenure with the employer. Employers are not required to pay employees for time spent on jury duty. However, employees serving on the jury are paid $7.50 a day as juror pay. Military Leave As part of New Mexico PTO law, military leave is a crucial aspect of employment law that provides protections and benefits for employees who serve in the armed forces or National Guard. Employers should be aware of their obligations regarding military leave to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations while supporting employees in their military service requirements. New Mexico implements the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which provides additional protections for military service members, including: 1. Job reinstatement rights upon return from military leave. 2. Continuation of health benefits during military service. 3. Protection against discrimination or retaliation based on military service. As per USERRA, leave for active military service can be up to 5 years without pay. In addition, they should be provided 24 months of health care coverage while on leave. New Mexico State Law New Mexico also has state laws protecting military personnel from retaliation from employers to serve in the military. It applied to all service members from the National Guard, the US Armed Forces, and other reserved services. The law requires that all such employees be reinstated within 90 days of leaving their active duty or recovery from injury. Voting Leave New Mexico’s employment laws mandate that employers provide employees up to 2 hours of paid time off for voting. However, this leave is optional for employees whose work time starts after 2 hours of voting time or ends 3 hours before voting ends. Voting leave in New Mexico allows employees to exercise their democratic rights without fear of reprisal or loss of pay. Employers cannot request proof of voting or require advance notification for voting time off. New Mexico State Holidays in 2024 New Mexico observes various state holidays throughout the year. However, private employers are not required to provide paid or unpaid holidays to employees. Public employees are provided with 11 state holidays. Here is the complete list of holidays observed in New Mexico in 2024: Holiday Observed in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Juneteenth Wednesday, June 19 June 19 Independence Day Thursday, July 4 July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 1st Monday in September Indigenous Peoples’ Day Monday, October 14 2nd Monday in October Veterans Day Monday, November 11 November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 4th Thursday of November Presidents’ Day (Observed) (*) Friday, November 29 Day after Thanksgiving Christmas Day Wednesday, Dec. 25 December 25 How can Truein help with paid time off management?
