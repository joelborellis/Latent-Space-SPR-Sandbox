Implement Face recognition based attendance for your organisation – in hours, not days! May 31, 2024 Face recognition sounds like the technology of the future and it is natural to have inhibitions like – prohibiting costs, a long learning curve and so on. Fortunately, those are just myths. In this article, we address your biggest fear – change management. Will moving to a new System require new training, complex hardware or large upfront investments? Absolutely not. Some face recognition system work only with their own accompanying hardware which is not easy to get around. While it was the easiest way to launch Truein, we researched for years to bring you a solution that is totally hardware independent. Table of Contents Why should you opt for a hardware-independent Attendance System? 1. There are no entry or exit barriers 2. It works on user mobiles too 3. There are no operating system woes 4. It lives on and off internet 5. It is portable 6. It is easy to maintain Take the first step. We do the rest Why do we claim one day kick-off? Why should you opt for a hardware-independent Attendance System? 1. There are no entry or exit barriers The idea is to allow employees to come face-to-face with an app that recognizes them and marks attendance. Truein is that AI-powered employee attendance application which makes it possible. Question is – what do you install the app on?  Any smart device that fits your budget. It can be an existing large screen phone or a tablet you already own. In spite of being so versatile, our hardware-independent system is practically 100% accurate and works better than any complex system. 2. It works on user mobiles too If you are not ready to invest in a tablet yet, you can ask employees to mark attendance from their very own phones. Worried they will mark attendance from home, without stepping into the premise? Geo-fence it – Define the geographic boundaries of attendance. Only when they are in that radius, they will be able to do it. 3. There are no operating system woes We’ve ensured that our staff attendance system is truly universal. Pick any Android or iOS based mobile or tablet and you are good to go. 4. It lives on and off internet Do you want your attendance data to get updated in real-time, showing managers instant reports? You would need Wi-fi or 4G data. If you are in a remote location where connectivity is an issue, Truein will still work just fine. It will operate in offline mode, allowing attendance or visitor management to take place without a glitch. When the internet connection gets restored, the data will get automatically synced. 5. It is portable Unlike a hardware-based system which would require a technician to install and uninstall, we have no such hassle. Your office has moved to a new location? Simply take your tablet along and place it at the new entrance. 6. It is easy to maintain If the hardware device you install gives you hiccups, you don’t have to fret. Like we mentioned, no technician required. You troubleshoot it like you would troubleshoot any Android or iOS device. And if you still need help, we are always a call away. Take the first step. We do the rest The biggest barrier to adopting new technology is ‘apprehension’. Deep down, all of us fear change and the ‘unknown’ complexities it might bring. That leads to procrastination – putting it off to another day. HR departments put up with tons of manual work, annoying syncs and the woes of traditional attendance systems or visitor management systems because moving to a new solution seems like a mammoth task. Sometimes it helps to talk to an expert to find out if those fears are grounded in reality or they are just myths. We have installed Truein at organizations as small as twenty employees and as large as fifty thousand employees. The feedback is unanimous – it takes a day to get started and it is the most intuitive system. The COVID Pandemic situation made us switch to new normal in many ways and one of them was switching from Biometric attendance system to touchless attendance system . We enquired with many vendors and suppliers for such products and finally we opted for Truein – Touchless Face based attendance system for our Shindewadi plant. The system support. software and product all are inline with our needs and expectations.

Why face-recognition technology is the only way forward for businesses? May 31, 2024 Face recognition technology was used to bar intruders in the Avenger Towers. Does it ring a bell? What was sci-fi yesterday, is a reality today. The most obvious application is security – the Forensics department identifying criminals, the Highway authorities identifying speeders, the Airport authorities recognizing fleeing convicts. There are more fun applications too – Facebook allowing you to tag your pictures. Have businesses used these insights? Of course, yes. When you read these use-cases, you might get a ‘Aha’ moment Table of Contents Business Applications of face recognition technology Face recognition attendance 1. It leaves no margin for error 2. It is non-intrusive 3. It is contactless Face recognition visitor management system 1. It is as secure as it can get 2. It leaves a good impression 3. It is always-on Face recognition technology is accessible Business Applications of face recognition technology Face recognition attendance While biometric attendance has been around for a while, face recognition attendance is way ahead of the curve. Let’s look at the top three reasons why businesses have embraced it with both hands. 1. It leaves no margin for error The swipe not working, or the thumb not being recognized – which one are you used to? When you use an attendance system that doesn’t work at all times, you are allowing manual systems to take over. The manual system has to be synced back for the final tally. There is a scope for proxy as well as human error. Face recognition attendance is practically 100% accurate and reliable. It leaves no room for parallel systems. Leading face-recognition technologies benchmark the system with the eyes. An employee may grow old or fashionable – it doesn’t matter. No facial or hair change can hamper its ability to recognize. 2. It is non-intrusive Most attendance systems require a user action like placing their thumb on the keypad for identifying its geometry. Many may or may not want to part with this personal data and may find it unsecure. Users have shown less concerns with leaving their picture behind as it is easily accessible on social media or other public domains any way. 3. It is contactless The user just passes by the hardware and the system completes the scan. With COVID, this is a necessity. Even otherwise, it reduces attendance time to one second and leads to zero queuing up outside the gates. Can you imagine the happiness score when an everyday chore becomes this convenient? We’ve seen this work like charm in even organizations with fifty thousand employees. And that is not the benchmark – it can work with an unlimited database. Face recognition visitor management system It is appalling to see large organizations leave important matters such as security to one man at the gate. While we don’t doubt his efficiency, it is definitely not fool proof. Here are top three reasons enterprises have moved to face recognition-based visitor management system . 1. It is as secure as it can get With face recognition, anybody stepping in leaves a record in the system which can be back tracked or verified by anybody in the organization at a later date. Well, it is also real-time so large organizations can have multiple watchful eyes. Going to think of it, is there any other system that can leave breadcrumbs that lead back to the face of the visitor – the true identifier? 2. It leaves a good impression Signing manual books or standing at the gate while the employee confirms appointment is definitely not pleasing. And imagine standing in a queue to make a pass! We’ve all been there and done that. We’ve cursed and we’ve left stamping our feet. Why would we want to leave visitors with such agony? A face-recognition based technology at the door speaks volumes about how progressive your organization is. 3. It is always-on An enterprise never sleeps and is not on a holiday during weekends. You need systems to blacklist people, to send you notifications and to be vigilant. A face-recognition based system lets you manage visitors remotely and have an extra pair of eyes at the door.  Again, there is no margin for error. Face recognition technology is accessible Back in the 60s when the technology was first identified, the computing power was too low to render quick results. In the 2002 Super Bowl, the experiment failed badly due to false criminal alarms. Today, we have left it all behind and have achieved exceptional accuracy and reliability. It is not a privilege of multi-national organizations alone. It is affordable and accessible to even startups. It does not require any complex hardware as well. An organization deciding to implement it can start as early as yesterday with practically no barriers. It truly is the only way forward. Businesses that don’t adopt it run security risks and productivity losses. This technology is becoming widespread – out of the movies into our very own premises.

All data gets synced back in real-time, churning reports that can go straight into salary calculations and other reporting. Is that really practical? Can you actually do that without the need for manual overrides and physical syncs? After all, there are so many exceptions – branch wise holidays, employee wise weekly offs and so on. Well, we worked on all those exceptions and made them a rule within our employee attendance app . You can define all these unique possibilities and automate practically 100%. Let’s look into top 5 such compliances Table of Contents Top face attendance automations 1. Assign weekly off 2. Define public holidays 3. Set workhour calculations 4. Calculate overtime 5. Detect mask When convenience meets compliance Top face attendance automations 1. Assign weekly off While most of your employees may have Saturday and Sunday as weekly off, there would be contract workers or shift employees with different week offs. It is particularly true for call centers, plant operations or retail stores. How would the system know if an employee is absent or just has a weekly off? You get to define it. You can define employee categories (full time, part-time, contract, temporary, factory etc.) and then assign specific weekly offs for them. Of course, you can do it at an individual level or as a bulk action – either ways weekly offs can be taken care of easily. 2. Define public holidays In case of multinational organizations, the geography of the branch office defines the public holidays. For instance, an office in Maharashtra may have a public holiday on Uttaran. However, a branch in Kerela may have a public holiday on Onam instead. These differences don’t have to be manually entered. Each branch can be defined as a separate site with its own set of public holidays and other rules. 3. Set workhour calculations Are your salary calculations dependent on total hours clocked by the employee? There are several ways organizations can calculate it and it is possible to define your own rules. You can set the system in a way that it uses the ‘First in, Last out’ rule to report total hours clocked. Alternately, the system can calculate the actual time based on every single in and every single out. Either ways, it is easy to spot outliers who have too many outs or break-time. You can go a step further and define all days with less than 5 hours as part-time. 4. Calculate overtime If you have workers who get daily wages or whose renumeration is calculated ‘per hour’, you might have to pay them overtime for every extra hour. It is a common practice in factories, BPOs and Government organizations. Even this can be automated using a simple toggle (on/off) for each of the below pre-defined rules Above 9 hours in a day to be auto added as overtime Consecutive 7th day of work to be auto added as overtime (public holiday not counted) Work hours on public holiday will be added to overtime Overtime apply only when OT is more than 30 minutes Work hours on weekly off will be added to overtime If you would like to apply these rules to only a specific set of employees, you can segregate them by categories and tick or untick ‘apply overtime’ on relevant categories.  Employers can use this feature to automate time tracking and enforce overtime policy . 5. Detect mask Would you like to restrict entry to employees who are not wearing mask? Truein face recognition attendance system is geared to identify masks on their faces. It will deny entry in case attendance is marked without it. “Get centralized and foolproof Time & Attendance for your organization” Book a Free Demo Now Start Free Trial First name Enter First Name Last name Enter Last Name Company name Enter Company Name Select Employee Size Work email Enter Work Email Address Mobile number Enter Mobile Number Create Account When convenience meets compliance Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?
