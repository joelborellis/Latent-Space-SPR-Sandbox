One of the critical aspects of workforce leave management is the availability of Paid Time Off (PTO). Maine PTO law is a significant regulation that benefits the workforce and proves advantageous for employers. This is why employers must adhere to Maine PTO payout laws. To help employers, we have created this comprehensive guide to explain the Maine PTO law from an employer’s perspective. Here, we delve into the specifics of who the law applies to and how much-paid time-off permits. We will explore the types of leave covered under the law and when employees can accrue paid time off.

Maine State Holidays 2024 How does Truein help with paid time-off management? Conclusion To whom does the Maine PTO law apply? The Maine PTO law applies to all employers who operate within the state of Maine and employ at least ten employees. The law applies to many businesses, from small enterprises to large corporations, non-profit organizations, and government entities. Essentially, Maine’s PTO law covers full-time, part-time, and per diem workers who are covered by Maine’s unemployment insurance law . However, the Maine PTO law does not protect employees in the seasonal industries. Ignoring or failing to adhere to the law’s requirements can lead to legal consequences, including fines and potential lawsuits from employees. An employee is considered a Maine employee under the following situations: If an individual performs their job within the state of Maine, they are generally considered as a Maine employee, regardless of their residence. Employment contracts and agreements may specify the jurisdiction or state under which an individual is considered an employee. These contractual terms can impact the legal determination of an employee’s status. The employee resides in Maine but has yet to receive directions or control over services from any other state in the U.S. It’s important to note that determining employee status can be complex and may vary depending on specific circumstances. Also, an individual covered by another state’s unemployment insurance law won’t be considered a Maine employee, irrespective of their residence or employment status. Additionally, all employment contracts signed after January 1, 2021, must include Maine’s Earned Paid Leave (MEPL) as a benefit. Season industries operate for less than 26 weeks within a calendar year and only during a regularly recurring period. Such employers are exempt from providing MEPL as a benefit. Here is a list of season industries the Maine Unemployment Insurance Commission maintains. If your business falls under the category of seasonal industry, then you have to report seasonal workers’ wages for your employees under a separate unemployment insurance account number. How much paid time-off is allowed as per Maine PTO law? Maine PTO payout laws entitle eligible employees to accrue paid leave at one hour for every 40 hours worked. The accrual of PTO starts when the employee joins the company and continues for as long as the employee remains with the company. Employers must allow accrual of paid time-off from the employee’s first day of employment. There is no waiting period, and employees can start building their PTO balances immediately upon joining the company. Accrual continues as long as the employee remains employed, and unused PTO can be carried over to the following year. However, employers who front load at least 40 hours of PTO at the start of the calendar year are not obligated to track accruals or allow carryovers. Furthermore, employers can also put an annual cap on the amount that can be used in a year. It’s essential for employers to keep accurate records of accrued PTO for each employee, as this is not only a legal requirement but also helps employees track their available paid time off. What kinds of leave does the Maine PTO law provide? Under the Maine PTO law, employers must provide employees leave for various purposes. Based on the requirement, employees in Maine must be able to get: Sick Leave Maine allows paid and unpaid sick leave under federal and state laws. It enables employees to take time off work when ill, reducing the risk of spreading illnesses to colleagues and allowing them to recover fully before returning. Maine follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), enabling employees to take up to 12 weeks unpaid time off for medical reasons. To be eligible for unpaid sick time off, employees should have worked with their current employer for at least 12 months or 1,250 hours the previous year. Also, FMLA applies to employers with 50 or more workers at the same site or within a 75-mile radius. Maine’s Earned Paid Leave is also applicable here. Employees can use earned time off for sick leave under the act. Also, the Maine Family Medical Leave Requirements Act (MFMLRA) in the state mandates that all private employers with 15 or more employees at one location should offer 10 weeks of unpaid family medical leave to all employees in 2 years. Vacation time-off Maine became the first state in the country to mandate paid leave for any reason, including non-medical reasons such as vacation time. The MEPL law (M.E. Rev. Stat. tit. 26, § 637 ) allows employees to accrue one hour of paid leave for every 40 hours worked. The provision enables vacation leave for all eligible employees. Any additional vacation time, whether paid or unpaid, is generally at the discretion of employers. However, if an employer has established a policy or employment contract offering paid vacation outside the MEPL law, they must adhere to their policies and provide the benefits accordingly. Bereavement Leave Maine does not require employers to provide paid or unpaid bereavement leave. Bereavement leave policies, if offered, are typically determined by individual employers. Employees in Maine may use accrued PTO or personal time for bereavement purposes if their employer permits it. Still, many employers offer bereavement leave so their employees can attend funerals or deal with the loss of a loved one. Jury Duty Leave Maine mandates employers to provide unpaid time off to employees to participate in jury duty. The law prohibits employers from discharging or penalizing employees for jury service. Employers are not required to pay employees their regular wages for the days of jury service. Instead, the court pays employees serving jury duty in Maine $15.0 a day, freeing employers from the obligation to provide compensation for jury duty. Employees cannot use accrued PTO or vacation time to cover any additional time needed for jury service if available. Military Leave Maine law provides job protection and reemployment rights for employees who are members of the U.S. armed forces or the state National Guard and are called to active duty or training. Maine employers must grant military leave to employees as required by federal law, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). The law ensures their jobs are protected during service and prohibits discrimination against employees based on their military service. Maine military leave provision also protects employees serving active duty. Military leave can be paid or unpaid based on the employer’s discretion. Also, employers must allow a rest period before they require employees to join back. Here’s how much rest should be allowed based on the length of military service: Length of Military Service Rest Period 3 days or less 24 hours 3 to 15 days 48 hours 15-30 days 72 hours 30 to 180 days 2 weeks 180 days or longer 90 days Voting Leave Maine law has no statute for voting leave. Employers are not required to provide paid leave for employees to vote in state, federal, or county elections. It is the sole discretion of the employers to allow employees voting leave on the day of the election during the employee’s regular working hours. Employers usually grant this leave to employees who need more time to vote outside of working hours. When can I allow the employees to accrue paid time off? Maine’s Earned Paid Leave law gives employees the right to accrue paid time off (PTO) from their first day of employment. Therefore, you do not have a say in this context; your employees will start accruing paid time off with no waiting period or probationary period. Employers must know they can impose a 120-day waiting period before employees can use their paid time off. Additionally, employees must notify employers to ensure business operations are not adversely affected due to abrupt absences. The law states ” use of leave must be scheduled to prevent undue hardship on the employer.” Employers should also clearly communicate the PTO accrual process to employees to ensure transparency and compliance with Maine’s PTO law. How much paid time-off are Maine employees entitled to? Maine employees are entitled to accrue paid time-off (PTO) at one hour for every 40 hours worked under MEPL. The accrual of paid time-off begins on the employee’s first day of employment and continues for as long as the employee remains employed. Maine PTO payout laws also allow employees to carry over 40 hours of unused accrued PTO into the following calendar year. This provision ensures that employees do not lose their accrued leave and will enable them to use it in the future. Is it necessary for the employer to record accrued earned paid time off? Actually, in Maine, it is optional for employers to keep records of accrued earned paid time off (PTO) for each of their employees. However, still maintaining accurate records of accrued PTO is good business practice. While it might now be a legal requirement under Maine’s earned paid leave law, your employees can ask about their paid time off status. They can also ask for information on how their PTO is tracked and documented. Maintaining these records helps ensure transparency and compliance with the law. Accurate records enable employers to track employees’ PTO usage, prevent disputes or misunderstandings, and facilitate smooth payroll processing. How does the Maine PTO law affect my employees' other benefits like paid time off, holiday pay, sick leave, etc.? Maine’s Earned Paid Leave law has no implications for employee benefits, including paid time off, holiday pay, sick leave, and other related aspects. The law only sets universal minimum paid time off guidelines that employers must follow in the state. If your existing company policies allow at least 40 hours of paid time off yearly, no changes need to be made. Any other paid time-off and leaves offered and related policies, including the accrual rate and the ability for employees to use accrued PTO for various purposes, such as sick leave or vacation, remain unaffected by the law. If your employees have already earned over 40 hours of paid time off under company policies, you cannot take it away from them using MEPL. Also, Maine’s PTO law does not directly affect health insurance benefits. Still, employers should know that offering paid leave can contribute to employee well-being, indirectly impacting health insurance benefits. Can I ask for a notice from the employee for accrued paid time off? Yes, employers in Maine can typically ask employees to provide notice up to 4 weeks in advance for the use of accrued paid time off (PTO) as long as they establish clear and reasonable notice requirements in their PTO policies. However, this notice period requirement is not applicable when “an emergency, illness or other sudden necessity” arises. Notice requirements help employers manage staffing and workflow effectively, ensuring that an employee’s absence does not disrupt operations. This is why employees must provide notice for foreseeable PTO use. Employers can also restrict how many employees can take time off at once. They can also set blackout dates if it causes them undue hardship. Employees must refrain from asking for PTO on such days. However, they still can take leave for unforeseeable situations, such as sudden illness or family emergencies, even on blackout dates. How does the Maine PTO law affect the health insurance an employer must provide the employee? Maine PTO law does not affect an employee’s health insurance. No employer can change or take any feature from an employee’s health insurance because they use paid time off. Employers should ensure that their health insurance and other employee benefits comply with applicable state and federal laws. While the Maine PTO law primarily focuses on PTO accrual and usage, employers must also adhere to laws governing health insurance coverage and employee benefits. What are the penalties if I don't adhere to Maine PTO law? Penalties for non-compliance with Maine PTO payout laws can vary, and employers must adhere to the law’s requirements to avoid potential legal consequences. The specific penalties may depend on the circumstances and the severity of the violation. Employers in Maine found violating the law may be subject to administrative fines imposed by the Maine Department of Labor (MDOL). Sometimes, you may be required to pay employees back and compensate them for the leave they should have received. This could include paying employees for unused accrued PTO. Is carryover of paid time off allowed? In Maine, employees can carry PTO under the state’s PTO law. Employers in Maine must permit employees to carry over up to 40 hours of unused accrued PTO from one calendar year to the next. Any PTO hours beyond this carryover limit may not be eligible for carryover and could be forfeited. Employers should know this carryover requirement and communicate it to employees in their PTO policies. Maine State Holidays 2024 Maine doesn’t require employers to provide employees with paid or unpaid holiday leave. Still, most employers allow leave on observed state holidays throughout the year. Here are the Maine State holidays for 2024 that are recognized as days off for state government employees, and private employers may also observe these state holidays. Holiday Date in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Washington’s Birthday Monday, February 19 3rd Monday in February Patriots Day Monday, April 15 3rd Monday in April Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Juneteenth Wednesday, June 19 June 19 Independence Day Thursday, July 4 July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 1st Monday in September Columbus Day Monday, October 14 2nd Monday in October Veterans Day Monday, November 11 November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 4th Thursday of November Christmas Day Wednesday, Dec. 25 December 25 Holidays that fall on a Saturday are observed on Friday, and holidays that fall on a Sunday are observed on Monday.

As an employer in the state, you must be aware of MA PTO laws not only for legal requirements but also for facilitating a positive work environment, retaining talent, and ensuring compliance with the state’s labor regulations. Compliance with these Massachusetts PTO laws helps businesses avoid costly legal disputes, maintain a motivated and productive workforce, and establish a reputation as a responsible employer. This article explores MA PTO laws and provides an overview of various types of leaves and PTO payouts at termination. Table of Contents What are Massachusetts PTO Laws related to various kinds of leaves? 1. Vacation time-off 2. Sick leave 3. Paid sick leave 4. Accrual of sick time 5. Bereavement Leave 6. Jury Duty Leave 5. Military Leave 6. Voting Leave Eligibility for paid sick leave in Massachusetts Use of earned sick leave Notice and documentation Carryover of earned sick time Payout of unused earned sick time at termination What happens to PTO Payout at termination? Unlimited Paid Time Off and Wage and Hour Laws Statutory Provisions Addressing Vacation Pay Payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination Massachusetts State Holidays 2024 How does Truein help with paid time-off management? Conclusion What are Massachusetts PTO Laws related to various kinds of leaves? 1. Vacation time-off Massachusetts does not require employers to provide employees with paid or unpaid vacation time. Still, most employers offer paid vacation as a benefit to attract and retain employees. However, as there is no regulation, vacation time off policies typically vary from employer to employer. Also, if employers provide paid or unpaid vacation time off, they should share all the related policies with employees, including accrual rates, usage restrictions, and payout rules. To maintain fairness and consistency, employers should communicate their vacation policies and apply them uniformly to all employees. Additionally, paid time off laws in Massachusetts don’t mandate vacation days; however, if agreed, employers must pay out vacation time upon an employee’s termination. 2. Sick leave Massachusetts observes the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which mandates eligible employees unpaid sick leave. Employees working for a company with 50 or more workers at one location and working for the current employer for at least 12 months or worked 1,250 hours the previous year. Employees can use sick time for their illness or medical needs or to care for a family member. 3. Paid sick leave Massachusetts is the third state in the U.S. to guarantee paid sick time off for employees. It mandates that all private employers provide paid sick leave to employees. However, small business owners are not required to pay for sick time off. Paid sick leave in Massachusetts is governed by the Earned Sick Time Law, which aims to provide eligible employees with paid time off to address their own or a family member’s illness, medical needs, or issues related to domestic violence or abuse. 4. Accrual of sick time All eligible employees in Massachusetts accrue sick time at a rate of one hour of earned sick time for every 30 hours worked. However, this accrual is not infinite, and an employee can accrue up to 40 hours of earned sick time per calendar year. 5. Bereavement Leave Employers in Massachusetts are not required to offer bereavement leave for employees. Bereavement leave is time off granted to employees following the death of a family member or loved one and is not legally required under Massachusetts labor regulations. Employers have sole discretion in offering bereavement leave as part of their employee benefits. Most employers still provide bereavement leave to support their employees during difficult times. 6. Jury Duty Leave Massachusetts law recognizes the importance of jury service in the judicial system and mandates that employers provide time off for serving on a jury. It applies to most employees in Massachusetts, including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. The length of jury duty leave can vary depending on the specific case, court, and trial duration. Jurors are typically required to serve for the trial, and employers cannot discriminate or take any adverse actions against employees serving on a jury. Massachusetts law requires employers to provide regular wages to employees for the first three days of jury duty. After that, the government will pay the jury $50 a day to the serving employees. 5. Military Leave Massachusetts has laws to protect the employment rights of members of the National Guard and other reserve components of the U.S. Armed Forces. These laws ensure that employees who serve in the military can return to their civilian jobs without adverse consequences. The state implements the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) for military leave. In addition to USERRA, Massachusetts law protects employees serving in active military duty from any discrimination at the workplace once they join back. The length of military leave can vary depending on the specific deployment or service requirements. Employees may be called for short-term training or extended deployments, and their job protection rights apply accordingly. 6. Voting Leave Massachusetts law provides employees in specific industries unpaid time off to vote during certain elections. This includes employees in mercantile, manufacturing, and mechanical industries. Employers in these sectors should provide workers with paid time off in between work hours to cast their vote during elections. The specific conditions and requirements for voting leave may vary, but employees should be able to exercise their right to vote without fear of negative repercussions from their employers. Eligibility for paid sick leave in Massachusetts Paid sick leave law applies to all employers with 11 or more employees. Employers in Massachusetts with fewer than 11 employees must provide unpaid sick leave under the law. All types of employees are eligible for paid sick leave, including part-time and full-time employees and seasonal and temporary workers. Use of earned sick leave All employees can use their accrued earned sick time for various purposes, including: Their illness or medical needs include routine medical appointments, treatment for chronic conditions, and recovery from diseases or injuries. To tend to medical care for a family member. Employees can use earned sick time to care for a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, or parent of a spouse or domestic partner who requires care due to illness, medical needs, or medical appointments. Issues related to domestic violence or abuse include seeking medical or legal assistance, attending court hearings, or participating in safety planning. Notice and documentation Employees are expected to notify employers to maintain business operations without staff shortage. That is why employers can require employees to provide reasonable notice of their intention to use earned sick time when necessary. Also, employers may require documentation for paid sick leave if the earned sick time is used for more than 24 consecutive work hours or 3 working days. However, employees are not required to disclose the cause of sick leave or medical condition in the documentation. Carryover of earned sick time Employees can carry over 40 hours of unused earned sick time to the following calendar year. Employers can also frontload 40 hours of paid sick time at the start of the year so they don’t have to allow carryover of earned sick time. Payout of unused earned sick time at termination Massachusetts law does not require employers to pay employees unused earned sick time upon termination. Employers are prohibited from taking any adverse action against employees who exercise their rights under the Massachusetts Earned Sick Time Law. What happens to PTO Payout at termination? Earned paid time off is termed wages, and Massachusetts employers should pay employees unused PTO upon termination. Any unused sick leave is not mandatory and must be paid in the final paycheck. The payout of accrued, unused vacation days at termination in Massachusetts is generally subject to the policies and practices established by the employer. Employers should have a clear and well-documented PTO policy that outlines their stance on PTO payout at termination. This policy should be communicated to employees. In some cases, the terms of PTO payout may be governed by employment contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or other legally binding agreements between the employer and employee. These agreements should be followed in case of termination. Unlimited Paid Time Off and Wage and Hour Laws Unlimited PTO policies are gaining traction in Massachusetts. It allows employees to take as much time off as needed but has a reverse effect as employees take less vacation due to uncertainty about acceptable limits. Additionally, offering unlimited PTO complicates payout during termination. Employers make the case that as there is a complete PTO policy, employees have no PTO days that have been “accrued.” On the other hand, terminated employees argue that employers should be obligated to pay the unused PTO just because they offer unlimited PTO. Offering unlimited PTO does not affect an exempt employee’s exempt status as long as they continue to receive their full salary for any week they perform work, with limited exceptions. In Massachusetts, employers are generally not required to pay out accrued, unused vacation time at termination, regardless of whether the PTO policy is unlimited. However, the policy should be communicated to employees. Statutory Provisions Addressing Vacation Pay In Massachusetts, employers should treat vacation time as wages. The state requires employers to pay out unused PTO to their employees. While it is at the employer’s discretion to decide whether or not to offer paid vacation benefits to their employees, if they agree to provide paid time off, they must abide by the agreed policies. If an employer provides paid vacation, they typically establish rules for how employees accrue vacation time and how it can be used. These rules should be communicated clearly to employees. Payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination MA PTO laws are clear on the payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination. State law does require employers to pay out accrued vacation time to employees upon termination if it is agreed in the employment contract. Massachusetts law does not mandate accrued sick leave time payout upon termination. Instead, it is left to the employer’s discretion to determine their policy on this matter. The terms of vacation payout at termination may also be governed by employment contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or other legally binding agreements between the employer and employee. Employers should adhere to these agreements when making termination payments. This is why employers should communicate their vacation policies, including the treatment of accrued vacation at termination, to employees.

They provide solution-based construction services that add value to industrial, commercial, and residential projects. Established in Pune in 1990, they have nearly 22 active sites, and new locations are added from time to time. Apart from their office staff, they deal with a lot of unorganized sector labor. Girish Nimbalkar AGM HR SJ Contracts We have been using the Truein attendance system at our 22 sites for over 6,000 staff since August 2018. Before Truein, using a time and attendance system at our construction sites was a big challenge. It is an excellent solution. We’ve found it to be very user-friendly and easy to use. Truein has built-in customization options and provides multiple real-time reports. Individual users can quickly generate the required reports, irrespective of their location. Challenges SJ contracts used a swipe card system along with paper-pen manual syncs for attendance. For a long time, they faced the problem of proxy attendance. Also, their attendance system did not provide them with real-time reports. They had multiple sites, and since there were no centralized controls, attendance tracking was tedious. They wanted to bring about traceability, transparency, and: Find a solution to the process of manual on-boarding of new workers daily Allow managers to check attendance reports in real-time to maximize productivity Make their ever-changing staff accountable through a stringent attendance system Get answers to strategic questions like: • How many workers are at a specific site at any particular time? • How many workers are changing frequently on a daily or weekly basis? • How many person-hours are being committed at each site? Solution The company implemented Truein attendance and benefited from the 70+ in-built features. Face recognition based attendance for completevisibility Self onboarding feature that makes the registration process of new workers fast and hassle-free Blacklisting feature to bar entry of delisted agencies and ex-workers Web-based detailed dashboard as well as app-based reporting for real-time updates on each site at one central location Reports for detailed analysis and estimations of staffing needs Do you want to know more ?

The retail store facilitates one-stop-shop convenience for its customers and caters to the entire family’s needs. Ashish Banga CHRO Vishal Mega Mart We switched to Truein 2 years back (Mar-2020). Our staff’s safety, convenience, and well-being are our key priorities. The Truein team partnered with us to ensure seamless implementation and integration of the Truein system and helped us to manage our attendance requirements for a large, diverse workforce spread across India. I highly recommend Truein for any large distributed workforce that needs a robust and reliable system to manage its time and attendance processes. Challenges Vishal Mega Mart used biometric machines and manual offline systems for attendance across their stores. This led to mismanagement of attendance data and a lack of transparency. Also, as their staff was frequently transferred from one store to another, keeping a clear record of their attendance data was a cumbersome task. Furthermore, collating reports from different systems into one centralized reporting system resulted in errors and data mismatches. They wanted a uniform time and attendance solution across their stores that can: Be centrally managed by the team at the head office Handle the staff transfer scenario Provide real-time and comprehensive reports with a single click Help implement different policies (half-day, weekly off, etc.) across all the stores Solution Truein Time and Attendance solution helped Vishal Mega Mart to: Implement a policies across its stores Manage staff transfer along with a provision to track their attendance history Have access to real-time updates of the entire organization’s attendance on the web dashboard and the app Generate detailed reports for analysis and further processing Set customized policies for all their stores that can be managed at their head office Truein Roll Out: Truein went live across all the 450+ stores of Vishal Mega Mart in a single day.

Streamline your attendance process Truein's accurate, automated, and centralized Time & Attendance Solution helped Unispice to streamline the attendance of their farm workers and production unit workers Customer Stories Sites 5 Staff 2000 Country Guatemala, Central America Industry Farming (Agriculture)/ Contractual Staff About Unispice Unispice is a farming industry firm headquartered in Guatemala in Central America.  The firm was founded in 1991 and has since expanded its operations to include state-of-the-art packing and processing plants, as well as its own farming operations. Their farming operations ensure transparency and traceability within the food industry and help trace each piece of produce directly to its source. Today, they grow farm-fresh vegetables and export them all over the world. Henry Carrillo Farm Administrator Unispice Our experience with Truein has been highly positive. The system has improved the income of personnel across different farms by reducing entry times and queues. The system’s reliance on face recognition for identification has strengthened the quality and accuracy of Time & Attendance process, eliminating any confusion arising from manual errors. Furthermore, Truein’s online record-keeping feature facilitates easy tracking of each staff, streamlining data capture and personnel administration. The platform’s dynamic and user-friendly interface has generated trust among end-users, while its comprehensive traceability feature ensures complete monitoring of new registrations, entry and exit records, and geo-positioned entry points. The system’s automated alerts also ensure compliance with relevant rules and regulations. Challenges Unispice has multiple farms spread across different locations, a production unit, and a head office. Some of their large farms are further divided into smaller farms. They employ contractual workers at their farms and production unit. They also have staff working for their head office. Time and Attendance management of the staff was a manual process at Unispice. The firm thus faced several challenges. Let’s look at some of their significant challenges and the solution they were looking for. At Unispice, farm workers are transferred across farms in the same location or to a different location on a daily basis. Manually keeping track of their headcount was a cumbersome process. It was also challenging to track the location of the workers and the hours they put in at each farm. The farm workers' attendance was manually managed and thus was error-prone and lacked transparency. The firm wanted to streamline and automate their staff's clocking In/Out procedures. Their farm workers are hired from various contractor agencies. The management wanted easy access to information regarding these agencies and the number of workers they send daily. They also wanted details about the staff domicile, especially their nationality, region, and the city they belong to. The farm workers are hired on a contractual basis and keep changing frequently. Thus, onboarding was a hassle and a continuous affair. Therefore, they sought an attendance system that could ease the onboarding process. The farm workers and production workers often trespassed into each other's areas. This was another challenge, and they wanted to restrict these movements. The farm workers are spread across multiple farms. Supervisors, HR, or management had to manually check for information on a worker's whereabouts, number of workers, workers on leave, etc. They expected an attendance system with centralized controls that would allow them to instantly access this information from any location. Solution Truein deployed attendance kiosks at their farms, production unit, and head office. They had separate kiosks for each farm. The Truein Kiosk App was automated, face-recognition based, and captured attendance accurately. Truein offered them centralized controls. They could now easily retrieve information on the number of workers on a farm, their location details, leave data, hours they put in on a farm, their clock In/Out time, etc., from the dashboard. With Truein, Unispice had easy access to information regarding their contractor agencies, the number of workers they were sending, the nationality of the workers, and any other information regarding the domicile of the workers. Truein also simplified the onboarding process for them. They could now easily add laborers through the kiosk. At Unispice, the workers are transferred across the farms daily. At times, a worker works at multiple farms in a day. With the additional site access feature, workers can be given access to multiple farms. They can now easily punch out from one farm and punch in at the farm they have been given access to. Truein also offered them kiosk-level restrictions. The farm laborers can now enter the production unit only if they have the required permission and vice versa. Truein offered them easy integration with their existing ERP and payroll and set up their staff directory (master data). The integration is real-time and gets reflected in their system on a real-time basis. Geofencing, multisite kiosk attendance, group attendance, OT, shifts, etc., are a few other features that Unispice has appreciated and implemented. Truein roll out: Truein went live across all 400+ stores of Vishal Mega Mart in a single day. More than 4000 users signed up and registered within 24 hours of launch without a single call being made to any person. The entire organization went live in 7 days. Do you want to know more ? Talk to us Watch a demo Result Truein’s automated and foolproof attendance system streamlined and simplified the attendance process at the farm. Accurate time capture helped prevent reconciliation issues and revenue leakages. Centralized controls offered them easy access to staff information from any location. They had real-time info on the number of workers procured from a contract agency and their domicile details. This brought about transparency when it comes to staff count and helped save revenue. Kiosk-level restrictions and geofencing prevented the farm workers from moving into the production unit and vice versa and bought accuracy in attendance. Easy integration with their existing ERP and payroll, simplified payroll processing Instant onboarding and quick attendance capturing improved staff productivity. With multi-site access, transferred farm workers can easily punch In/Out at multiple farms. This brought transparency regarding location and hours logged in at a farm.

PTO laws in the state encompass a range of leave categories, and employers must know laws regarding these leaves to protect the rights of employees. This article elaborates on various Michigan PTO laws and provides a comprehensive overview of different leave types, rollover policies, and other relevant employer considerations. Table of Contents What are Michigan PTO Laws related to various kinds of leaves? 1. Sick Leave 2. Maternity, Paternity, & FMLA 3. Bereavement Leave 4. Jury Duty Leave 5. Military Leave 6. Voting Leave 7. Leave for Victims of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault 8. Emergency Response Leave What happens to rollover or carry-over paid time-off as per Michigan PTO law? Are Use It or Lose It Policies Legal in Michigan? Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination Michigan State Holidays in 2024 How does Truein help with paid time-off management? Conclusion What are Michigan PTO Laws related to various kinds of leaves? Michigan recognizes the rights of employees to have different types of leaves, but employers should know which leaves are mandatory. They should have clear policies and procedures to manage every kind of leave effectively. Here are details of state and federal laws that you should know to ensure compliance and a supportive work environment for employees. 1. Sick Leave Michigan follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act that all employers must follow to ensure employees get time off to attend to medical emergencies. Additionally, Michigan’s Paid Medical Leave Act (MPMLA) was implemented in 2019, which requires eligible employers to offer paid sick leave for employees. Under FMLA, employers with 50 or more employees are required to provide sick leave to eligible employees. Eligibility includes part-time, full-time, and temporary workers who have worked an average of 25 hours per week or 1250 hours in the preceding calendar year. It allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave for approved reasons. Eligible employees can use sick time for various reasons, including the employee’s illness or injury, the disease or injury of a family member, medical appointments, and issues related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Under the MPMLA, employees are entitled to paid leave, and they accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 35 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours per year. Michigan PTO law allows employees to carry over unused paid sick leave from one year to the next. Employers can also frontload 40 hours at the start of each benefit year. Also, employers can require reasonable notice from employees for foreseeable sick leave and documentation for absences exceeding three consecutive days. 2. Maternity, Paternity, & FMLA Maternity and paternity leave in Michigan is primarily governed by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Employers with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the worksite must offer maternity and paternity leaves to all employees who have worked for the employer for at least 12 months, with at least 1,250 hours worked during the previous year. FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in 12 months for the birth or adoption of a child. Therefore, employers in Michigan should allow paternity/maternity unpaid leave for up to 12 weeks. Employers should include all the information about the medical leave policies in their employee contracts and handbooks. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is another federal law that Michigan employers must follow to ensure that all eligible employees can take maternity/paternity leave for the birth or adoption of a child. PDA ensures that both mothers and fathers have the opportunity to bond with their newborn or adopted child without facing any discrimination from employers. It provides job protection, allowing employees to return to their previous or equivalent position. Michigan’s Civil Rights Act is yet another law that protects employees on paternity/maternity/FMLA leave from discrimination at work. The act is there “to prohibit discriminatory practices, policies, and customs in the exercise of those rights based upon religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status. To preserve the confidentiality of records regarding arrest, detention, or other disposition in which a conviction does not result; to prescribe the powers and duties of the civil rights commission and the department of civil rights; to provide remedies and penalties; to provide for fees; and to repeal certain acts and parts of acts.” 3. Bereavement Leave Employers in Michigan are not required to provide bereavement leave to employees. However, most employers provide leave for bereavement on compassionate grounds by employers. As bereavement leave in Michigan is not governed by specific state laws, employers can establish their policies regarding the amount of leave and whether it is paid or unpaid. While there is no law, employers must adhere to the agreed-upon policies if bereavement leave is included in benefits in an employee contract. 4. Jury Duty Leave Jury duty leave in Michigan is governed by federal law, as in every other state. Employers must provide time off to employees summoned to serve on a jury. Employers should grant unpaid leave to employees called to serve on a jury. Employees should not face negative consequences, such as termination or demotion, solely because they fulfill their jury duty obligations. The length of the jury trial determines the duration of jury duty leave. Employees can take time off from work for jury duty as long as their jury duty is scheduled. Employers are not required to pay employees for compensation during jury duty leave. However, while jury duty leave in Michigan is unpaid by employers, jurors receive compensation directly from the court for their service. In Michigan, jurors are paid $12.50 a day for jury duty. They also receive mileage reimbursement for travel. 5. Military Leave Michigan has laws to provide job protection and leave rights to employees who are National Guard or Reserves members. Such employees can join active military duty without facing any discrimination or consequences. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is a federal law that provides protection, reinstatement rights, and unlimited leave for active duty. In addition to USERRA, Michigan local law requires employers to grant unpaid military leave to employees called to active duty, such as training or deployments. It mandates that such employees must be reinstated to their former or equivalent positions upon their return from duty. The length of military leave for an employee can vary depending on the nature and duration of the military service. 6. Voting Leave Unlike most U.S. states, Michigan has not made it mandatory for employers to provide time off for voting. No federal or state law specifies whether this leave should be paid or unpaid. It may vary depending on the employer’s policies. Employees who do not have sufficient time to vote outside of working hours can request their employers to take voting leave to take time off to vote. 7. Leave for Victims of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Michigan requires employers to provide unpaid leave to employees who are victims of domestic violence or sexual assault. Eligible employees must be victims of domestic violence or sexual assault or have a family or household member who is a victim. Affected employees can utilize this leave for various purposes, including seeking medical treatment, legal assistance, counseling, or relocation to a safer location. Leave for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault provides employees time to recover from the trauma and take necessary actions without the risk of losing their jobs or other employment rights. 8. Emergency Response Leave To provide job protection to employees who are volunteer emergency responders, classified as state civil service members or certified American Red Cross volunteers, and need to respond to emergencies with emergency response leave. Employees are eligible for this leave during times of disasters and other emergencies. Emergency response leave can be paid depending on the company policies or rules laid down by the governor or the civil service commission. What happens to rollover or carry-over paid time-off as per Michigan PTO law? Michigan is one state that allows use-it-or-lose-it policy, making it possible for employers to enforce policies requiring employees to use their paid time off within the calendar year or lose them. However, there are specific rules for sick leave. As per the Michigan Paid Medical Leave Act, employees can roll over up to 40 hours of unused sick leave from one year to the next. Alternatively, employers in Michigan can also front load the entire 40 hours of sick leave at the beginning of the benefit year. Therefore, they are not required to allow employees to roll over unused sick leave hours at the end of the year. Are Use It or Lose It Policies Legal in Michigan? Yes, use-it-or-lose-it is legal in Michigan, and employers are not required to allow accrual of PTO for carry-over to the following year. Additionally, employers can pay accrued, unused vacation on termination only if the company’s policy or contract requires it. Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination In Michigan, handling accrued, unused vacation pay upon an employee’s termination is not governed by specific laws and solely depends on employer policies. Employers are not required to provide a payout for unused Paid Time Off (PTO) when an employee leaves the company unless it is agreed in company policies. If an employer’s policy or employment contract explicitly requires the payout of accrued vacation upon termination, then the employer is legally bound to do so. Also, if there are no company policies on PTO payment on termination, employees can receive compensation for unused vacation time upon leaving the company. This default rule ensures that, without clear guidelines, employees are entitled to compensation for their unused vacation time. On the other hand, employers in Michigan have the legal right to establish company policies that deny payment for accrued vacation leave upon an employee’s termination. However, such policies must be communicated and agreed to in writing by the employees. It should include conditions where payment can be withheld, such as if the employee fails to provide adequate notice before leaving or is not employed as of a specific date in the year. Furthermore, employers may legally stipulate circumstances under which employees would be disqualified from receiving payment for accrued vacation upon separation. Again, such conditions and terms are clearly stated in a written policy or contract and agreed to by the employee. Michigan State Holidays in 2024 Michigan PTO law does not require employers to provide holiday leave to employees. Private employers can provide paid or unpaid holidays depending on their company policies. The majority of employers chose to offer time off for observed holidays. Here is a list of 14 state holidays in Michigan. Holidays falling on Saturdays are observed on Fridays, and holidays that fall on Sundays are observed on Mondays. Holiday Date in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Washington’s Birthday Monday, February 19 3rd Monday in February Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Juneteenth Wednesday, June 19 June 19 Independence Day Thursday, July 4 July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 1st Monday in September General Election Day Tuesday, November 5 November 2 to 8 (*) Veterans Day Monday, November 11 November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 4th Thursday of November Thanksgiving Friday Friday, November 29 Day after Thanksgiving Christmas Eve Tuesday, Dec. 24 December 24 Christmas Day Wednesday, Dec. 25 December 25 New Year’s Eve 2025 Tuesday, Dec. 31 December 31 How does Truein help with paid time-off management?

Missouri overtime rules ensure commitment to fair labor practices and employee well-being. In this article, we explore the intricacies of Missouri law on overtime pay, providing a comprehensive guide for employers to navigate these regulations effectively. Table of Contents Who is Eligible for Overtime Pay in Missouri? Rules of Overtime in Missouri (A) Overtime pay for tipped employees (B) Overtime for salaried employees in Missouri ​​Is overtime mandatory in Missouri? What happens if my employees refuse to work overtime? Missouri overtime exemptions Federal overtime exemptions Missouri overtime exemptions Fluctuating Workweek Method (FWW) in Missouri How does Truein help with overtime management? Conclusion Who is Eligible for Overtime Pay in Missouri? Missouri overtime rules are applied to all employees covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The federal law states that all employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek are typically eligible for overtime pay. The overtime pay is also calculated at 1.5 times the employee’s regular pay rate for each hour worked beyond the standard 40-hour threshold. While most hourly workers in Missouri are entitled to overtime pay, there are non-exempt employees. Therefore, employers must know the difference between exempt vs. non-exempt employees. In simple words, non-exempt employees are those who are covered by the overtime provisions of the FLSA. They are, therefore, entitled to overtime pay whether they are full-time or part-time employees, irrespective of the business size that employs them. Exempt employees, however, are not eligible for overtime pay under the FLSA. Specific categories of workers who are exempt from Missouri overtime rules include: Executive Administrative Professional roles such as chefs, lawyers, CPA, etc. Inhouse salesmen In most cases, exempt employee’s primary duties are managerial, administrative, or professional. For example, an exempt executive must regularly supervise two or more other employees, have management as the primary duty, and have genuine input into other employees’ job status decisions (such as hiring, firing, or promotions). Employers must diligently classify employees correctly to avoid potential legal repercussions and uphold fair labor standards. Rules of Overtime in Missouri Missouri law on overtime pay affects employees across categories, except exempt employees. Employers should be aware of overtime rules in the state to ensure that non-exempt employees, whether hourly or salaried, receive fair compensation for their extra work hours. Missouri overtime rules also allow tipped employees to balance the unique nature of their compensation with the principles of labor rights. Let’s take a look at these rules for each type of employee. (A) Overtime pay for tipped employees Missouri allows employers to consider the tips employees receive while deciding pay for tipped employees. The state will enable employers to use a “tip credit” system, where tipped employees can be paid a lower minimum wage, up to 50% of the state minimum wage. However, when calculating overtime pay for tipped employees, employers must base the calculation on the entire state minimum wage, not the reduced tipped wage. Simply put, when calculating the pay for tipped employees, employers should use the overtime rate at 1.5 times the full state minimum wage without any deductions for tip credits. This Missouri law on overtime pay for tipped employees ensures they receive fair compensation per federal labor laws. (B) Overtime for salaried employees in Missouri Not all salaried employees in Missouri are exempt from receiving overtime pay. All salaried employees who are non-exempt and earn less than the threshold of $684 per week are generally eligible for overtime pay. If such salaried employees have regular work weeks, then employees are obligated to make overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. However, there is a unique case of non-exempt salaried employees with fluctuating work weeks. Such employees in Missouri may qualify for overtime pay under the Fluctuating Workweek Method (FWW). This method allows for an overtime premium of one-half (0.5) times their regular hourly rate, even when their workweek hours fluctuate. This arrangement provides a way to compensate salaried employees with varying work hours each week but still work overtime. ​​Is overtime mandatory in Missouri? What happens if my employees refuse to work overtime? In Missouri, no specific state laws mandate overtime work for employees. However, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, employers have the legal right to require their employees to work overtime. There are no restrictions on the number of hours employees can be required to work overtime in any workweek. It gives employers in the state the legal right to lawfully require employees to work more than the standard 40-hour workweek. Refusing to comply with an employer’s request to work overtime can lead to lawful termination or other disciplinary actions against the employee according to company policies. Therefore, the employee or the employer can terminate the employment relationship at any time for any lawful reason. Missouri overtime exemptions In Missouri, overtime exemptions are governed by both federal and state laws. Therefore, employers in the state should be aware of the exemptions in both laws. Federal overtime exemptions Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), certain occupations are exempt from overtime pay, including executives, administrative employees, and professionals earning at least $684 per week. It also includes computer professionals earning $684 per week or at least $27.63 per hour. Also, highly compensated employees earn more than $107,432, and outside sales employees are exempt. Missouri overtime exemptions Missouri state law which is followed for overtime calculation is the Missouri Revised Statutes Title XVIII. Labor and Industrial Relations § 290.505. Overtime compensation, applicable number of hours, exceptions . Under the Missouri state law exemptions for voluntary work, foster parents, employees in specific camps, students working for educational institutions in exchange for benefits, private residence workers, babysitters, golf caddies, newsboys, commission-only employees, employees in businesses with gross income less than $500,000 annually. It also exempts nonviolent offenders in correctional facilities and certain agricultural workers. Employees working less than 4 months per year in a resident or day camp and working on or about a private residence for at most 6 hours per shift are exempted. Fluctuating Workweek Method (FWW) in Missouri We already discussed how workers working irregular work weeks are paid under FWW method in Missouri. Such employees are entitled to an overtime premium of one-half (0.5) times their regular hourly rate. Let’s understand this with an example. Suppose an employee has a fluctuating work schedule; they sometimes work 40 hours a week and other times more or less. If for a week they worked 50 hours, then their overtime pay will be calculated like this: We will assume they earn $800 that week. Hourly rate: $800 / 47 = $17.02 per hour To calculate the overtime rate, we will multiply the hourly rate by 0.5 for every overtime hour during the week. $17.02 per hour x 0.5 = $8.50 for each overtime hour worked Total overtime pay: $8.50 x 10 overtime hours = $85 How does Truein help with overtime management?

Statutory Provisions Addressing Vacation Pay Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination Minnesota State Holidays in 2024 How does Truein help with paid time-off management? Conclusion What are Minnesota PTO Laws related to various kinds of leaves? Minnesota’s PTO laws are varied, depending on what type of leave employers want. There are specific laws and regulations related to various kinds of leaves, including sick, maternity, paternity, bereavement, jury duty, military, and voting leave. We take a closer look at each of these types of leaves. 1. Sick leave Minnesota follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Minnesota Earned Sick and Safe Leave law. Both these laws require employers to provide paid sick leave to their employees. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal labor law in the United States that provides eligible employees with certain job-protected leave entitlements for specific family and medical reasons. It does not apply to all employers but only applies to employers with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the worksite. However, public agencies, including local, state, and federal employers, are covered by the FMLA regardless of the number of employees. An employee must have worked with the current employer for at least 12 months to be eligible for sick leave under FMLA. Also, employees should have accumulated at least 1,250 service hours during the 12 months. The qualifying reasons for sick leave for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave are: For the employee’s serious health condition. To care for a spouse, child, or parent with a severe health condition. For the birth and care of a newborn child or the placement of a child through adoption or foster care. To address particular qualifying exigencies for individuals working in the military. For such people, sick leave can be up to 26 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave within 12 months. Under this law, employees accrue sick leave based on the hours worked. Employers with 21 or more employees must provide paid sick leave, while smaller employers must provide unpaid sick leave. This leave can be used for the employee’s illness, a family member’s illness, or safety-related reasons. Employers must comply with the specific requirements outlined in the law to ensure employees receive their entitled sick leave benefits. For more details, refer to Minnesota Paid Sick and Safe Leave. Minnesota Earned Sick and Safe Leave (ESSL) law allows employees to take up to 48 hours of paid sick leave per year. The new law applies to all private employers and was enacted on January 1, 2024. The allocated sick leave time can be used for any of the following reasons: Employee’s illness, injury, or other medical condition To care for a sick, injured, or suffering family member To recover from domestic abuse, etc. 2. Maternity, Paternity & FMLA Minnesota follows federal laws like the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). It includes certain protections and benefits for maternity and paternity leave. FMLA ensures eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child. It is applicable for both mothers and fathers who can use the leave to take care of the child or adjust to an adopted child. Minnesota employers are also subject to the Minnesota Pregnancy and Parental Leave Act. It also grants eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for pregnancy, child care, parental care, or other related medical needs. The eligibility for maternity and paternity leave under the Minnesota Pregnancy and Parental Leave Act is the same as for FMLA. Furthermore, employees must understand the specific company policies and requirements that apply to their situation. 3. Bereavement leave Minnesota has no specific state law requiring employers to provide bereavement leave. As an employer in the state, you are not obligated to offer time off for bereavement. However, many employers offer bereavement leave as part of their benefits package or employment policies. The availability and duration of bereavement leave are at the employer’s sole discretion. Also, employers should communicate these policies with their employees so they are aware of the company’s stance on bereavement leave. 4. Jury duty leave Minnesota law requires employers to provide unpaid leave for employees summoned to serve on a jury. Employers cannot penalize or retaliate against employees for fulfilling their civic duty by serving on a jury. The duration of jury duty leave can vary depending on the trial or jury service length. Minnesota law does not require employers to pay employees regular wages or salaries while serving on a jury. However, the court pays such employees $20.00 a day and reimbursement on mileage for travel. Upon completing their jury duty service, employees must be reinstated to their previous positions with the same terms and conditions of employment. Employers must treat employees returning from jury duty service as if they had been continuously employed during the leave period. 5. Military leave Military leave in Minnesota is governed by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). It provides certain rights and protections for employees who serve in the military or National Guard. Under the military leave, employees must provide advance notice to their employers when called to active duty or required to participate in military training or drills. Minnesota state law also provides additional security to employees under the military leave laws. This includes: Up to 4 years of unpaid leave to serve in the military to the members of the National Guard Up to 10 days of unpaid leave to an employee related to an individual in military who has been injured or killed in active duty. Up to 1 day of unpaid leave a year to an employee; an immediate family member of a member of the US armed forces. Minnesota employers with 20 or more employees at the exact location must grant unpaid leave to serve in the Civil Air Patrol. All employers in the state are generally required to grant leave for the duration of the military service and are prohibited from terminating or penalizing employees for fulfilling their military obligations. 6. Voting Leave Minnesota law allows employees who are eligible voters to take paid time off to vote in a state primary, general, or special election. It applies to all eligible voters, full-time and part-time employees and temporary workers. There are no specific rules for the time off, and the law requires employers to provide employees with “sufficient paid time” to vote during state elections. The time off may vary depending on the employee’s work schedule and the polling hours. Employers have discretion in determining when employees can take time off to vote. By Minnesota law, employers are prohibited from interfering with or penalizing employees for taking time off to vote. Retaliation or discrimination against employees exercising their voting leave rights is illegal. What happens to Accruals under Minnesota PTO law? No Minnesota PTO law mandates employers to provide their employees paid time off (PTO) or vacation accruals. Instead, the state allows employers to establish their PTO policies and determine whether and how employees accrue and use PTO. As an employer, you can establish an accrual system to decide the rate employees accrue PTO, such as a certain number of hours per pay period or based on years of service. It can also include the rules for using accrued PTO, including when employees can take time off and any restrictions or requirements for requesting PTO. If an employer decides to offer accruals in the benefits package, they should communicate the policies clearly in the employment contract or collective bargaining agreement that specifies PTO accruals and usage; both the employer and employee must adhere to the terms of the agreement. What happens to roll-over/carry-over time-off under Minnesota PTO law? Minnesota is one of the states that allow use-it-or-lose-it policy. Hence, employers are not required to provide the roll-over or carry-over of accrued paid time off (PTO) from one year to the next. It is at the discretion of employers to establish their policies regarding the treatment of unused PTO. Employers can set caps on the amount of PTO accrued or carried over. Capping the carry-over time off ensures that employees only accrue a few paid days, which can hinder business operations. Employers should ensure that their PTO policies are consistently applied to all employees and adhere to any applicable employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements. Statutory Provisions Addressing Vacation Pay In Minnesota, earned vacation pay is termed as wages. Employers must adhere to their established policy or employment contract if they offer vacation pay. This includes any stipulations regarding the accrual, use, and payment of vacation pay. If an employer’s policy states that vacation pay is earned, then under Minnesota law, it may be considered wages and could be due upon termination of employment. Employers should communicate their vacation pay policies to employees to avoid misunderstandings. Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination No Minnesota PTO payout laws require employers to offer the payment of accrued, unused vacation upon termination. Employers have the discretion to create policies and practices regarding the payment of accrued vacation time upon termination. Employers may have “use it or lose it” policies, which means that employees forfeit any accrued, unused vacation time if it is not taken before termination. If there is an employment contract, collective bargaining agreement, or individual agreement regarding payment of accrued PTO on termination, the employer and employee must adhere to the terms of that agreement. Employers should communicate their policies regarding the payment of accrued vacation upon termination to employees. Likewise, employees should review and understand their employer’s policy and consult HR or management for clarification.

And if such is explicitly in the employer’s policy, they must adhere to their policies. Does your Missouri state require employers to pay out PTO? Missouri PTO payout laws do not mandate employers to pay out accrued PTO upon an employee’s termination or resignation. Employers in the state have complete discretion to pay employees for any unused time off on their departure from the company. However, if an employer in Missouri offers these benefits, they should communicate the established policy or employment contract with the employees. And if such is explicitly in the employer’s policy, they must adhere to their policies. What are Missouri PTO Laws related to various kinds of leaves? 1. Sick leave Missouri has no state-specific sick leave law, and employers are not mandated to provide paid sick time to employees. However, all employers must follow federal law, i.e., the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). As there are no local state laws regarding sick leave, employers must pay attention to the criteria for FMLA requirements. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law allowing eligible employees with job-protected leave for specific family and medical reasons. The eligible employees are the ones who meet the following criteria: Working for an employer with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius for at least 20 workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Have worked for the current employer for at least 12 months. However, these months don’t have to be consecutive; an employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months. According to the FMLA leave policy, all eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during 12 months for specific family or medical reasons. The qualifying reasons to avail of sick leave under FMLA are: The birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child. Attending to the medical needs of a spouse, child, or parent with a severe health condition. A serious health condition affecting employees. Any qualifying exigency arising from a spouse, child, or parent’s active duty military service. 2. Maternity and paternity leave Missouri employees should receive leave for maternity and paternity needs under the FMLA. All employers in the state should provide eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for specific family or medical reasons. The same rules apply to the eligibility for maternity and paternity leave. Additionally, Missouri does not have particular maternity or paternity leave laws beyond FMLA requirements. Also, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is another federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against pregnant women in all areas of employment. No pregnant employee can be discriminated against regarding hiring, assignments, promotions, firing, etc. 3. Bereavement leave No Missouri PTO payout laws mandate employers to provide paid or unpaid bereavement leave. Individual company policies typically determine the availability of bereavement leave. Usually, most employers in the state offer two days of bereavement leave to affected employees. However, these bereavement leaves are unpaid and are not required to be paid at the time of termination. 4. Jury duty leave Employers in Missouri are legally required to grant employees leave for jury duty service. Both full-time and part-time employees are entitled to this leave when they receive a jury duty summons. The duration of jury duty leave can vary, depending on the specific requirements of the jury service. While Missouri law mandates that employers must grant employees leave for jury duty, it does not require employers to provide compensation for the time an employee spends on jury duty. However, people serving jury duty in Missouri are paid $6 a day and mileage reimbursement for travel. 5. Military leave In Missouri, military leave regulations are defined under the Revised Statutes of Missouri, Section 105.270 . According to this statute, “officers and employees of the state, or any department, agency, county, municipality, school district, or other political subdivision, as well as other public employees who are or may become members of the National Guard or any reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States, are entitled to leave of absence from their duties.” Employers are obligated to provide military leave to employees without loss of time, pay, regular leave, or any other rights or benefits for periods of military service. All employers should follow the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which protects job rights for individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily leave employment positions to undertake military service. It ensures that no individual is: 1. At a disadvantage in their civilian careers because of their military service. 2. Faces any challenges with their re-employed in their civilian jobs upon return from duty. 3. Is met with discrimination against by employers because of past, present, or future military service. 6. Voting leave Like all other states, Missouri mandates that employers provide voting leave to employees. Employers must grant up to 3 hours of paid leave for employees to vote to participate in the electoral process. All registered voters are covered under the voting leave policy. However, if an employee already has 3 continuous hours of off-duty before the polls, the employer is not obligated to provide additional time off specifically for voting. Also, employees must request this leave in advance, specifically before the election day. Employers are prohibited from penalizing or discriminating against employees who exercise their right to vote. What happens to Accrual under Missouri PTO payout laws? Under Missouri PTO payout laws, no employer is obligated to pay for unused paid time off. The state allows a “use it or lose it” policy, allowing employers to establish their PTO accrual and payout policies. As an employer in Missouri, you have the flexibility to determine how PTO accrues, whether it carries over from year to year, and if it can be cashed out upon departure. However, all employers must communicate their PTO policies with all their employees through contracts, employee handbooks, and company websites. What happens to rollover/carry-over time-off under Missouri PTO payout laws? There are no PTO laws in Missouri on the rollover of unused leaves. The state allows “use it or lose it,” so employers are not mandated to carry over or roll over unused PTO from one year to the next. All companies have the discretion to establish their policies regarding the carry-over of accrued PTO. Although employees may forfeit any unused PTO, most companies offer carry-over unused time off at the end of the year to attract and retain employees. All the policies regarding PTO carry-over must be communicated to employees to avoid any misunderstandings or disputes. What happens to unused vacation time under Missouri PTO payout laws? Missouri PTO payout laws do not mandate employers to pay out unused vacation time upon an employee’s termination. Employers can choose whether or not to compensate employees for their accrued but unused vacation time. This flexibility allows you to establish policies that align with their business objectives while remaining compliant with state law. Employers need to have clearly defined policies regarding unused vacation time to prevent confusion and ensure fair treatment of employees. Am I liable to pay vacation paid time-off if the employee is laid off? Employers in Missouri are not liable to pay vacation paid time-off if they lay off employees. As no Missouri PTO payout laws exist, employers are not obligated to pay employees irrespective of how they are laid off. The decision to provide compensation for unused vacation time when an employee is laid off is at the employer’s discretion. The information should be clearly outlined in the company’s policies. Employers can determine whether they will offer their employees this benefit. Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination Missouri employers may pay out accrued, unused vacation time to employees upon termination as part of their company policies. Employers are not obligated to have final wages, including vacation on termination. Employers can legally prohibit employees from getting paid for vacation leave by creating policies they can sign as part of the contract. If you opt to provide this benefit, you should communicate the terms and conditions surrounding the payment of accrued, unused vacation time to avoid any ambiguity or disputes with their employees. Missouri State Holidays 2024 As an employer in Missouri, you must be aware of the state holidays, as these may impact employee schedules and expectations for time off. The usual state holidays in Missouri include New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. Here is a complete Missouri State Holiday 2024 calendar for employers to plan accordingly to accommodate employees’ time-off requests during these holidays and ensure smooth operations. Please note that private employers are not mandated to provide holiday leave to employees, and it depends on their company policies. Also, the holidays that fall on a Saturday are observed on Friday, and holidays that fall on a Sunday are observed on Monday.

In the context of overtime labor laws, employers in Louisiana are legally obligated to compensate eligible employees at a rate of one and a half times their regular wage rate for hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. For employers, understanding Louisiana overtime laws 2024 is essential for legal adherence and fostering a work environment where employees’ contributions are valued. Awareness of overtime regulations can save employees from costly legal disputes and improve employee satisfaction. This article thoroughly explores Louisiana overtime laws and details how employers manage workforce overtime. Table of Contents Working hour rules in Louisiana Louisiana Overtime Rates Here's how you calculate overtime rates in Louisiana in different scenarios Overtime Entitlement in Louisiana Overtime for various types of employees Employees on Commission Overtime pay exemptions and exceptions How and when an employee can claim for unpaid overtime pay Consequences for employers failing to pay overtime pay Here are some cases of such legal actions taken by employees against employers. How can Truein help with overtime pay management? Conclusion Working hour rules in Louisiana In Louisiana, as of 2024, the standard working hours are typically 40 per week. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) adopted the working hours rules, and Louisiana has no state policies regarding standard working hours and breaks. This means that private employers in the state are not obligated to provide either meals (lunch) or rest breaks. However, most employers in Louisiana provide these breaks as a standard practice to maintain a productive and healthy work environment. Furthermore, if you are hiring minors (under 18), Louisiana labor laws mandate that such employees must be provided a 30-minute break after working 5 hours. Another essential rule regarding working hours and breaks in Louisiana is that employers should pay for fewer than 20 minutes. It is a stipulation from the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Employers should also pay attention while scheduling unpaid breaks during work hours. If breaks are provided, they must be scheduled in a manner that does not violate the minimum wage and overtime requirements set forth by the FLSA. Louisiana Overtime Rates As of 2024, Louisiana overtime laws have no state statutes, and the state follows FLSA overtime provisions. Under this provision, employers must pay overtime to eligible employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek. The standard overtime rate in Louisiana is set at one and a half times the employee’s regular pay rate. The overtime calculation is relatively simple if an employee has a standard work week of 40 hours. Other scenarios can involve work weeks of less than 40 hours or variable elements in the income, such as commissions. It’s crucial for employers to accurately calculate this rate based on the employee’s standard pay, which may include hourly wages, salaries, commissions, and specific bonuses. Here's how you calculate overtime rates in Louisiana in different scenarios 1. Regular rate where bonuses or commissions are involved: Regular rate = (Total hours x hourly rate + workweek equivalent of the bonus and/or commission) / Total hours in the workweek In this case, employers are required to pay half of the regular rate for each overtime hour. 2. Regular hours less than 40: In this case, employees are required to pay regular wages for each hour up to 40 and 1.5 times the regular rate for the rest of the hours. For instance, if you typically have a 30-hour work week, and an employee has worked 16 overtime hours a week, then you will pay them a regular pay rate for 10 hours and 1.5 times the regular rate for the remaining 6 hours. Any updates or changes to overtime rates must be communicated to employees promptly. Also, employers should monitor any adjustments at the federal level as it could necessitate changes in how overtime is calculated and paid. Overtime Entitlement in Louisiana As Louisiana follows the FLSA overtime laws, employers must pay overtime to all non-exempt workers. Generally, all hourly employees are eligible for overtime pay. The distinction comes for certain salaried employees depending on their job duties and salary level. FLSA clearly classifies “exempt” or “non-exempt” employees. Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay regardless of their job title or salary. Exempt employees are executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and certain computer employees. However, employees who work in any of these roles but earn less than $684 a week are entitled to overtime pay. This is a partial list; for comprehensive details on exemption from FLSA, visit here . Therefore, it’s necessary that employers correctly classify employees to avoid misclassification issues, which can lead to legal complications and financial penalties. Overtime for various types of employees Employers in Louisiana must accurately categorize their employees as it affects their overtime pay. Misclassification or incorrect calculations can lead to legal issues and financial penalties. Employers should regularly review their payroll practices to comply with current laws and regulations. Hourly, tipped, salaried, and commission-based employees are all dealt with differently under the Louisiana labor laws. Here’s a breakdown of overtime calculations for various types of employees. Hourly employees Calculating overtime pay for hourly employees is easiest as there are no exceptions here. All hourly employees are paid one and a half times their regular hourly rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. Tipped employees Overtime for tipped employees, such as waitstaff, is calculated considering their standard hourly wage and tips. Employers in Louisiana must ensure that the combined income of tipped staff meets at least the minimum wage for all hours worked, plus the appropriate overtime rate. Tipped employees must receive overtime pay for hours beyond the standard 40-hour workweek at 1.5 times their regular pay rate. Employers can use a tip credit system to offer tipped employers reduced minimum wage. However, the tipped credit system must be separate from the overtime calculation as employees cannot calculate overtime pay at a rate lower than the minimum wage (i.e., $7.25) rate. Salaried employees A salaried employee is an individual who receives a set pay regardless of the hours worked. Non-exempt salaried employees must be paid overtime. Employers must calculate their hourly rate based on their weekly salary and hours worked to determine the correct overtime pay. As workweek hours can vary for salaried employees, employers should calculate the regular rate as follows: Weekly Pay = Annual Salary divided / 52 weeks Hourly Pay Rate = Weekly Pay / 40 hours Salaried employees are exempt from overtime pay if the weekly pay rate exceeds $684 weekly. All other salaried employees must receive overtime at 1.5 times their regular wage rate. For example, if an employee gets a salary of $600 per week and works 5 hours overtime, their overtime pay will be: Regular hourly rate: $600/40 hours = $15/hour Overtime rate: $15/hour * 1.5 = $22.50/hour Overtime hours: 45 hours – 40 hours = 5 hours Overtime pay: $22.50/hour * 5 hours = $112.50 Employees on Commission If employees earn commissions, their overtime rate must factor in commissions when determining the regular pay rate for overtime calculations. Louisiana overtime laws clearly state that employees on commission must be paid overtime at 0.5 times their regular wage rate, including commissions. The complication arises in determining their regular rate of pay factoring in the commissions. Let’s understand it with an example. Consider an employee who earns a weekly salary of $7.25/hour, receives $200 in commissions, and works 50 hours a week. Total earnings = (50 x 7.25) + 200 = $562.50 Regular Rate of Pay = $562.50 / 50 hours = $11.25/hour (new hourly rate) Overall rate of pay = $11.25 / 2 = $5.60 Total overtime pay = $5.60 x 10 = $56 Overtime pay exemptions and exceptions Employers should be aware of the exemptions in Louisiana overtime law to ensure they are not paying overtime to ineligible workers. Here are the employees who are exempted from overtime laws: 1. Executives: Employees whose primary duty is management, who regularly direct the work of at least two or more other employees, and who have the authority to hire or fire other employees are exempted. 2. Administrative: These employees perform office or non-manual work related to management or general business operations. They also exercise discretion and independent judgment. 3. Professionals: This includes employees requiring advanced knowledge in science or learning or a creative or artistic field. 4. IT: Certain computer employees may be exempt if they meet specific criteria related to their job duties and compensation. 5. Outside Sales: Employees primarily making sales or obtaining orders or contracts away from the employer’s place of business are exempt. 6. Farmers, transportation workers, and live-in housekeepers are also exempted. Employers should be careful when classifying employees in these categories, as misclassification can lead to legal issues. Reviewing job descriptions, duties, and salary levels to ensure compliance with the latest FLSA regulations is critical. How and when an employee can claim for unpaid overtime pay Employees in Louisiana are entitled to take action if they have not received the overtime pay. Employers must have a mechanism for workers to resolve the issue internally by bringing the matter to the employer’s attention. Employees can take legal action if the employer does not address the unpaid overtime pay issue. Such employees have two years from the date of overtime law violation to report the issue under FLSA. This period is extended to three years if the employer violates Louisiana overtime laws. Employees can claim unpaid overtime pay by reaching out to either the state or federal court. However, in Louisiana, employers have the right to transfer cases to federal court. Consequences for employers failing to pay overtime pay Employers in Louisiana who fail to pay the required overtime can face significant legal and financial consequences. This can include payment of the owed overtime pay to the employees and additional fines and penalties. Under FLSA, employees can file civil lawsuits against employers for failing to pay overtime. In this case, if employees win, the employer will have to pay double the overtime pay. In addition to civil lawsuits, the U.S. Department of Labor can fine such employers up to $1,000 per violation. In some cases, if the violation is found to be willful and repeated, employers might also face criminal charges, leading to fines and, in extreme cases, imprisonment. Here are some cases of such legal actions taken by employees against employers. Orleans Coroner’s Office faces pay lawsuit from fired death investigator . Here, the employee asserted that the employer wrongfully denied her overtime pay despite her frequently working more than 40 hours a week. A group of current and former deputies sued the sheriff’s department for unpaid overtime. The plaintiff reached an agreement with the employer . A Florida seaman filed a class-action lawsuit against New Orleans marine transportation company Harvey Gulf for allegedly unlawful pay practices. New Orleans bakery fined for labor pay violations for non-payment of overtime and recordkeeping violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. These cases illustrate how important it is for employers to adhere to Louisiana overtime laws and practice proper employee classification and accurate time tracking to ensure compliance and avoid legal action and financial liabilities.

Understanding and adhering to Florida’s overtime regulations is crucial for employers, as non-compliance can lead to significant legal ramifications, including costly lawsuits and penalties. Here is a guide on Florida overtime law for employers to help them ensure legal compliance and make overtime laws a strategic component of effective business management. Table of Contents Who qualifies for Overtime in Florida? What rights does an employer hold if an employee refuses to work Overtime? Rules of Overtime in Florida (A) Overtime pay for tipped employees in Florida Overtime calculation for tipped employees (B) Overtime for salaried employees in Florida: Overtime exceptions and exemptions in Florida How much are Florida employees paid for Overtime? What are the Florida Labor Laws regarding mandatory Overtime? Are employers required to notify their employees about overtime work in advance? How does Truein help with overtime management? Conclusion FAQs 1. Is mandatory Overtime legal in Florida? 2. Who is exempt from overtime pay in Florida? 3. Is Florida a daily overtime state? 4. Can employees refuse Overtime in Florida? Who qualifies for Overtime in Florida? Employers must follow the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in Florida, as no state overtime laws exist. Under the FLSA, non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay for hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. Under the FLSA, most hourly workers (full-time and part-time employees) are non-exempt. These employees qualify for overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular pay rate for each hour worked over 40 in a workweek. This includes both salaried and hourly employees. Salaried employees’ eligibility depends on their job duties and salary level. For instance, managers and administrators are exempt employees. Their job role, responsibilities, and salaries are evaluated to determine if an employee is exempt. Roles that involve executive, administrative, or professional duties often qualify for exemption. Also, non-exempt people should earn under $684 a week or $35,568 a year. Employees making less than this amount are generally non-exempt, regardless of their job duties. What rights does an employer hold if an employee refuses to work Overtime? Florida labor laws on Overtime give employers the right to terminate an employee’s contract if they refuse to work Overtime. The employer in the state generally has the right to enforce their work schedule, which can include mandatory Overtime. There is no protection for employees who refuse overtime work. Therefore, employers can require Overtime as part of the job, provided they compensate the employee appropriately according to overtime laws. Rules of Overtime in Florida The rules of Florida state overtime laws generally follow the guidelines established by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Your company policies must adhere to Florida’s minimum wage rates and overtime regulations. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity also provides guidelines, so employers must check it for the latest information. (A) Overtime pay for tipped employees in Florida In Florida, a tipped employee is the one who frequently receives tips of $30 and above every month. All tipped employees in Florida are subject to the state’s minimum wage laws; the state minimum wage in Florida is $12 per hour, but employers can pay tipped employees lower than minimum wage and up to $8.98 per hour. Employers can take a tip credit against the minimum wage for tipped employees. In simple words, the tip credit is the difference between the minimum wage of the tipped employee and the direct cash wage paid to the tipped employee. The immediate cash wage, or the “tipped minimum wage,” is typically lower than the standard minimum wage. According to the law , “ The FLSA permits an employer to take a tip credit toward its minimum wage and overtime obligation(s) for tipped employees per Section 3(m)(2)(A). An employer that claims a tip credit must ensure that the employee receives enough tips from customers and direct (or cash) wages per workweek to equal at least the minimum wage and overtime compensation required under the FLSA.” Overtime calculation for tipped employees Tipped employees are entitled to overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours in a workweek. Overtime should be calculated based on the regular pay rate, including the direct cash wage and the tips received. Let’s assume that a tipped employee works 50 hours a week and earns minimum wage + tips. Their regular gross Pay will be calculated as follows: Regular gross pay = Tipped Wage x Hours Worked In Florida, the tipped minimum wage is $7.98. Regular gross pay= $7.98 x 50 = $399 Overtime Pay = Tipped Overtime Wage X Overtime Hours Worked $13.48 x 10 = $134.80 Total gross pay = regular tipped pay + overtime tipped pay $399 + $134.80 = $533.80 + tips If the employee was making less than the minimum wage after tips, employers have to pay them the difference. (B) Overtime for salaried employees in Florida: Florida labor laws for Overtime for salaried employees depend on whether the employee is exempt or non-exempt. Exempt employees are typically not entitled to overtime pay. It includes employees who work as executive, administrative, or professional employees and earn a salary that meets the minimum threshold of $684 per week set by federal law. All other employees, part-time or full-time, are categorized as non-exempt salaried employees. They are entitled to overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for hours over 40 in a workweek. Calculating overtime pay for non-exempt salaried employees is simple. First, you need to determine their regular hourly rate using this formula: Hourly work rate = Weekly salary / the number of hours worked in a week. The Overtime should then be paid at 1.5 times this regular hourly rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. Overtime exceptions and exemptions in Florida Employers in Florida should understand the nuances of overtime exceptions and exemptions. Complying with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is essential. Here are the exemptions and exceptions based on the type of employment, job duties, and compensation you should keep in mind to comply with Florida law on overtime pay. Employees engaged in specific agricultural activities are exempt from federal overtime provisions. This includes individuals employed in farming, livestock production, and related agricultural activities. Individuals employed by certain seasonal and recreational establishments are exempt if such an employer operates up to seven months a year. Executive, administrative, and professional exemptions include people whose primary duty is managing a business or a recognized department. It includes employees who regularly supervise two or more full-time employees and have the authority to hire and fire. The profession exemption includes employees whose primary duty is performing work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning, usually obtained through a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction. Outside sales employees are also exempt from overtime pay. Additionally, highly compensated employees make $107 432 annually or $684 weekly. How much are Florida employees paid for Overtime? Florida’s overtime rate for all non-exempt employees is one and a half times the regular wage rate. Therefore, how much a Florida employee is paid for Overtime depends on their standard wage rate, which is different for employees. The federal FLSA mandates that all employees should be paid 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for each hour worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek. For example, if you pay an employee a standard hourly rate of $10 per hour, they would be entitled to overtime pay of $15 per hour for any hours worked more than 40 hours in a single workweek. However, an exception is made for non-exempt employees who have irregular work weeks. The Fluctuating Workweek Method (FWW), also known as the “half-time” method, calculates Overtime for such employees. This method is allowed under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and can be used when specific conditions are met, such as weekly work hours. Under FWW, employees are paid Overtime at one-half (0.5) times the regular hourly rate, as opposed to the standard time-and-a-half (1.5) rate used for most overtime calculations. Let’s understand this with an example. Suppose you pay a non-exempt employee a fixed salary of $600 weekly. Due to the nature of your business operations, their work hours fluctuate weekly. The employee worked 45 hours in one week and 50 hours the next week. Here’s how we will calculate the employee’s total compensation for each week using the FWW method: First, we will find the regular hourly rate for each week as follows: Regular Hourly Rate = Weekly Salary / Total Hours Worked For Week 1: Regular Hourly Rate = $600 / 45 hours = $13.33 per hour For week 2: Regular Hourly Rate = $600 / 50 hours = $12.00 per hour Overtime pay rate: Overtime pay rate = (Regular Hourly Rate x 0.5) x Overtime Hours Overtime pay rate for week 1 = ($13.33 x 0.5) x 5 hours = $33.33 Overtime pay rate for week 2= ($12.00 x 0.5) x 10 hours = $60.00 Total Weekly Compensation = Weekly Salary + Overtime Premium Total weekly compensation for week 1 = $600 + $33.33 = $633.33 Total weekly compensation for week 2= $600 + $60.00 = $660.00 Please note that the FWW method is subject to specific legal requirements and conditions; not all salaried employees in Florida are eligible to use it. Employers should ensure they comply with all applicable labor laws and use the proper overtime calculation method for their employees. What are the Florida Labor Laws regarding mandatory Overtime? Florida labor laws regarding mandatory Overtime are consistent with federal labor laws outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Employers in Florida can mandate employees to work Overtime as long as they are appropriately compensated. This means employers can schedule overtime work, and employees may be obligated to work those hours. However, employers cannot mandate exempt employees to work overtime as they do not fall under the Florida state overtime laws. It commonly includes certain salaried professionals, executive, administrative, professional employees, and agricultural and seasonal workers. For the mandated Overtime, the Pay should be paid at a rate of 1.5 times the regular hourly rate for each hour worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek. Also, employers must provide employees with meal breaks and rest periods, but they do not specifically regulate Overtime. Meal and rest break requirements may vary depending on the employee’s age and the specific industry. Are employers required to notify their employees about overtime work in advance? No Florida overtime law requires employees to notify employees in advance about overtime work. In the absence of any specific state law that mandates advance notice for overtime work, in Florida, employers have complete discretion to decide whether to make employees work overtime or not. While it is not a legal requirement, it is a good practice for employers to provide reasonable notice to employees when possible. Employers must pay attention to collective bargaining agreements. Usually, if there is a collective bargaining agreement, the agreement may specify specific rules or notice requirements related to Overtime. If it exists, employers and employees are bound by the terms negotiated in the contract and must adhere to them. It is in the benefit of employers to have company policies or practices regarding Overtime and advance notice. Employees should review their employment contracts, company handbooks, or guidelines to understand any specific requirements or expectations their employer sets.

As of 2024, Idaho overtime laws are rooted within the Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA), a federal law. Idaho has no separate overtime laws, and employers must compensate employees for hours worked beyond the standard workweek based on FSLA policies. Overtime is essential in several industries for meeting customer demands and addressing labor shortage. However employers in these industries must know the legal requirements and the general labor laws. This article details the specifics of Idaho overtime laws, providing a foundational understanding for employers. Table of Contents What are the Hiring, Working & Termination Laws in Idaho? Final paycheck in Idaho What Are the Key Labor Laws in Idaho? What is the Minimum Payment in Idaho? What is the Payment Due Date in Idaho? What are Overtime Exceptions and Exemptions in Idaho? What are Idaho Time Off/Break Laws? What are Idaho Breastfeeding Laws? What are the Idaho Leave Laws? What is Idaho Required Leave? What is Idaho Non-Required Leave? What are Idaho Child Labor Laws? How can Truein help with Overtime pay management for Idaho based employers? Conclusion What are the Hiring, Working & Termination Laws in Idaho? Idaho has specific laws that rule hiring, working, and termination policies within a workplace. These laws are designed to balance the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees. Therefore, employers must understand these laws to manage the workforce effectively and avoid legal pitfalls. 1. Hiring laws All the hiring practices must adhere to the Idaho Human Rights Act . There are several provisions in this Act for employers to follow. Non-discrimination: Employers must adhere to federal and state non-discrimination laws. No employee can be discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information. Right to Work State : Idaho is one of the 28 states that limit the reach of union organizations. As a “right to work” state, employees in Idaho cannot be required to join a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment. Employment-at-Will: As of 2024, Idaho still follows the “employment-at-will” doctrine, allowing the employer or employee to terminate employment at any time for any legal reason. Employees must be paid their dues within ten days from termination. However, employees can submit a request to speed up the compensation pay to 48 hours. The payment must be made on the next scheduled regular payday for non-salaried, non-hourly workers. 2. Working laws Wage and Hour Laws: Employers must comply with minimum wage requirements and pay overtime at 1.5 times the regular rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek unless exempt. 3. Termination laws Notice Requirements: Idaho state doesn’t require employers to provide notice before terminating an employee due to the at-will employment policy. Severance Pay: Idaho law does not require severance pay unless stipulated in an employment contract or employer policy. Final paycheck in Idaho There are clear guidelines in Idaho overtime laws regarding an employee’s final paycheck upon the termination, whether by resignation, discharge, or layoff. While in some states, employment laws mandate that the final paycheck must be provided immediately, Idaho laws don’t have this requirement. If an employee resigns or is terminated, the last paycheck must be given on the next regular payday or within ten days of resignation, whichever occurs first, excluding weekends and holidays. The final paycheck should include all wages or salary earned, including any accrued vacation pay, if the employer’s policy or employment contract provides such payment upon termination. What Are the Key Labor Laws in Idaho? Employers in Idaho must keep compliance with various Labor laws. Ensuring compliance with these laws is a legal requirement and helps companies provide a fair, safe working environment. Here are the essential Labor laws in Idaho. COBRA Laws : The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives workers and their families the right to choose to continue group health benefits even if the worker leaves the job. All employers in the state with 20 or more employees offering health insurance must comply with COBRA regulations. Such employers must provide employees and their families the option of continued healthcare coverage for up to 36 months in events like job loss, reduced work hours, death, divorce, and other life events. OSHA Laws : The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces standards to ensure a safe and healthful workplace because, as of 2024, Idaho doesn’t have any state occupational safety law. Therefore, all employers must adhere to federal OSHA standards, provide a workplace free from recognized hazards, conduct training in a language and vocabulary employees can understand, and keep records of work-related injuries and illnesses. Whistleblower Protection Laws: Idaho’s Whistleblower Act (Idaho Code 6-2104) protects public employees from retaliation who report a waste of public resources, violation, or suspected violation of state or federal law or regulation. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who participate in such reporting. However, private employees are not protected by the Whistleblower Protection Laws. Background Check Laws : Idaho labor laws mandate employers in specific sectors to conduct background checks on employees before hiring them. This includes school employees, senior care homes, staff at childcare facilities and senior care homes, workers dealing with disabled individuals, alcohol permit holders, bank employees, and truck drivers.

Also, employers cannot access medical records as they are private records. Laws Concerned with Employer Use of Social Media : Idaho allows employers to monitor their employees’ social media activities. An employee can be terminated if their social media activities are found to be violating or harming the employment policies. Drug and Alcohol Testing Laws : Private employees in Idaho have legal rights to conduct drug and alcohol testing for new hires and employees during their employment period. However, the test for drugs and alcohol must follow the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act . Testing is generally permissible pre-employment, post-accident, for reasonable suspicion, or on a random basis. The Davis-Bacon Act : All public sector contractors and subcontractors in the construction industry in Idaho must adhere to the Davis-Bacon Act . Employers engaged in such contracts must pay their laborers and mechanics locally prevailing wages and fringe benefits as determined by the Department of Labor. Recordkeeping Laws : Employers in Idaho must maintain accurate employment records for each employee, including details like name, address, occupation, hours worked each day and week, wages paid, and more. These records should be kept for at least three years and made available for inspection by the Idaho Department of Labor. Idaho Payment Laws : Idaho payment laws encompass several regulations regarding regular pay periods and wages. Every employer in the state must adhere to these laws to ensure workers are paid fairly and on time. According to Idaho Code § 45-608 : Employers must pay employees wages at least once a month on a designated payday. Law clearly states, “Nothing contained herein shall prohibit an employer from depositing wages due or from becoming due or an advance of wages to be earned in an account in a bank, savings and loan association or credit union of the employee’s choice, provided that the employee has voluntarily authorized such deposit.” Payment should be made within 15 days of the completion of the pay period. An employer can withhold payments for more than 15 days for good and sufficient reasons. What is the Minimum Payment in Idaho? In 2024, Idaho’s minimum wage laws follow the federal minimum wage, and there is no state-established higher minimum wage rate. Therefore, employers must pay workers at least $7.25 per hour. Tipped minimum wage in Idaho: Tipped employees are the ones who regularly receive more than $30 per month in tips. In Idaho, employers can pay a lower minimum wage to tipped employees as long as their tips, combined with the wages, equal at least the federal minimum wage. T ipped employees can be paid a minimum wage of $3.35 per hour. Employers are responsible for ensuring that tipped employees receive enough tips to make up the difference between the tipped minimum wage and the standard minimum wage. If not, the employer must make up the difference. What is the minimum wage in Idaho? The state allows for a subminimum wage for minors underage the age of 20 during their training period, which is the first 90 days of their employment. Subminimum wage is $4.25 per hour and is only applicable for a limited time, as defined by law. What are the exceptions to minimum payment in Idaho? Idaho Code Section 44-1504 outlines specific exceptions to the minimum wage requirements. These professions include executives, professionals, administrative staff, agricultural workers, outside sales, and individuals employed by a parent or sibling. What is the Payment Due Date in Idaho? Idaho overtime laws require employers to establish regular pay periods and pay employees at least once a month or at more frequent intervals if agreed upon. Employees must be paid wages on regular paydays designated in advance or not later than 15 days after the pay period ends. If a payday falls on a non-workday, payment should be made on the preceding workday. What are Overtime Exceptions and Exemptions in Idaho? Idaho overtime laws are in symmetry with the federal laws on overtime exemptions. All non-exempt employees must be paid overtime at 1.5 times their regular pay rate for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. There are exemptions for employees who make $684 a week. Most of the exceptions are based on the job roles. Here are the professional exceptions and exemptions to this rule: Executives Administrative employees Professionals Taxi drivers Agricultural workers Babysitters Hospital and residential care staff working a 14-day workweek schedule Employees engaged in outside sales Employees of certain seasonal and recreational establishments What are Idaho Time Off/Break Laws? Idaho has no state policy regarding time off and breaks. This signifies that private employers are not obligated to provide employees with meals or rest breaks. Still, most employees choose to offer breaks to boost productivity in the workforce. If an employer chooses to provide breaks, short breaks (usually 20 minutes or less) must be counted as compensable work hours. Any breaks of 30 minutes or more are not required to be paid for. What are Idaho Breastfeeding Laws? Idaho law supports nursing mothers in the workplace. Employers are encouraged to provide reasonable break time and a private space (other than a bathroom) for breastfeeding mothers to express breast milk for up to one year after the child’s birth. While nursing breaks are mandatory under breastfeeding laws , employers are not required to compensate for these breaks. What are the Idaho Leave Laws? Employee leave rights in Idaho encompass various categories, including required and non-required leaves. Employers must understand their obligations regarding these types of leave to avoid legal liabilities. Idaho does not require private employers to provide paid or unpaid sick leave, vacation, or holidays. An employer must adhere to their established policy or employment contract if they choose to provide these benefits. What is Idaho Required Leave? Here is a list of required leave that every employer must provide to employees: Family and Medical Leave : Idaho has no separate family and medical leave law and mandates the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for employers. All employers with 50 or more workers must provide eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for specific family and medical reasons. Military Leave : In line with the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), Idaho employers must provide unpaid leave for employees called to perform military service and guarantee reinstatement to their jobs upon return. Such employees are protected under FMLA and Service Member FML. Under general FMLA, employees related to people serving military duty are provided 12 weeks of unpaid leave, and Service Member FML offers 26 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a family member injured during active duty. Jury Duty Leave : All Idaho employers must provide unpaid time off for employees summoned to serve on jury duty. Employers cannot penalize or terminate employees for taking time off to serve on a jury. What is Idaho Non-Required Leave? Sick Leave: Idaho does not require private employers to provide paid or unpaid sick leave, vacation, or holidays. An employer must adhere to their established policy or employment contract if they choose to provide these benefits. However, state employees accrue sick leave at a rate of 1 hour for every 22 hours worked. Bereavement Leave: Employers are not required to provide bereavement leave, and it depends on their choice. However, if agreed in the work contract, bereavement leave must be provided. Voting Time Leave: As of 2024, no specific law in Idaho requires employers to give time off to vote. Allowing employees to vote during working hours is at the employer’s discretion. Vacation and Holiday Leave: Idaho does not require employers to provide vacation and holiday leave. The official federal holidays observed in Idaho include: State Official Holidays Date New Year’s Day 1 January Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Day Third Monday in January Washington’s Birthday Third Monday in February Memorial Day Last Monday in May Independence Day 4 July Labor Day First Monday in September Columbus Day Second Monday in October Election Day Every other year Veterans Day 11 November Thanksgiving Day Fourth Thursday in November Christmas Day 25 December What are Idaho Child Labor Laws? Idaho has child labor laws to protect the health and education of minors under the age of 16, 16, and 17. These laws specify the permissible work hours and types of employment for minors, ensuring their well-being is not compromised. What are the Laws on Working Hours for Minors in Idaho? Minors 14 and 15 are restricted regarding their work hours and times. They can work up to 3 hours a day and 18 hours a week during the school year. They are generally not permitted to work before 7 AM or after 7 PM, with extended hours to 9 PM during the summer vacation. Such minors can work 18 hours per week when school is in session and 40 when school is not. Minors aged 16 and 17 have no such restrictions but are still protected by child labor laws. They can work up to 48 hours per week and up to 8 hours per day. What are the Banned Jobs for Minors in Idaho? There are specific jobs that are considered hazardous, and Idaho’s child labor policy bans them for minors.

Employers should be familiar with the Louisiana PTO laws to ensure proper compensation. PTO is an umbrella term that encompasses various leave types, including vacation days, sick leave, and personal days. Paid time off is essential for employees because it gives them time to attend to personal and health-related matters without sacrificing their income or job stability. Louisiana PTO payout laws govern the accrual, usage, and payment of PTO, outlining employers’ and employees’ rights and responsibilities in managing time off from work per state regulations. This article details laws regarding Paid Time Off (PTO) in Louisiana and what Louisiana employers should know. Table of Contents What are the rules for the wages to be paid? Accrued Vacation Pay Louisiana's "Use it or Lose it" Vacation Policies Can employers cap the amount of vacation leave? What happens if the employer doesn't pay employees accrued or earned vacation pay? Do the employers also charge attorney fees? What are summary proceedings? How can Truein help with paid time-off management for Louisiana based businesses? Conclusion What are the rules for the wages to be paid? Louisiana emphasizes accurate payment of wages to all employees. As per the Louisiana Wage Payment Act , employers must pay employees their wages due to an employee on time. Especially when an employee leaves the company or is terminated, the final payout must include the regular earnings and any accrued benefits that the employee is entitled to, such as accrued vacation pay. Under the Louisiana Wage Payment Act, wages owed to the employees must be paid on or before the next regular payday and no later than 15 days following the date of termination or resignation, whichever occurs first. This pay regulation applies across various sectors. Any unnecessary delay in receiving earned wages can prompt legal actions from employees. Furthermore, there are industry-specific rules in Louisiana regarding wage payments. For instance, employers in the oil and gas industry must pay their employees at least twice per month on regularly scheduled paydays. If there are no designated paydays, the wages must be paid on the 1st and 16th of each month. The same norms apply to employers of mining, manufacturing, and public service corporations. Other private employers don’t have such regulations, and establishing their pay periods and paydays is at their discretion. Louisiana has no mandatory vacation time laws, so PTO depends on internal policies and contractual agreements. If any oral or written commitment regarding PTO exists between employer and employee, it must be followed. Accrued Vacation Pay As of 2024, no Louisiana PTO laws on vacation time accrual exist. In Louisiana, most employees are provided paid time off and have the freedom to create an accrual system that fits their business model and requirements. The states treat earned vacation time as wages. Hence, employers are legally obligated to pay such compensation under certain conditions. This status of accrued vacation pay as a wage is pivotal because it ensures that employees are compensated for their earned but unused vacation time. Employers also have the right to cap vacation time accrual to ensure an appropriate number of workers available to cover shifts. Louisiana's "Use it or Lose it" Vacation Policies Louisiana is one of the few states that allow “use it or lose it” vacation policies. Under these policies, employers can ask employees to utilize their accrued vacation time within a specific period, typically within the year it is accrued. Louisiana PTO laws make it legal for employers to restrict employees from carrying over unused vacation days to the subsequent year. However, when implementing “use it or lose it” policies, employers must ensure that these policies are carefully crafted, clearly communicated, and applied consistently. The details should be documented in the employee handbook or the employment contract and accessible to all employees for review. Can employers cap the amount of vacation leave? In Louisiana, employers have the legal right to cap the amount of vacation leave an employee can accrue. Employers can limit the total amount of vacation time employees can accumulate over a certain period. As Louisiana PTO payout laws have no obligation for employers to provide paid vacation time, all the regulations regarding vacation time accrual are at their discretion. That’s why sensitive issues like a cap on vacation leave must be clearly stated and communicated to all employees. The employee handbook and contracts should include policies regarding the maximum vacation time an employee can accrue. While capping vacation leave is legally permissible, employers should consider the impact such policies may have on employee morale and retention. Sufficient vacation time can contribute positively to employee satisfaction and workplace culture. What happens if the employer doesn't pay employees accrued or earned vacation pay? Failure to pay employees accrued or earned vacation time can have significant legal consequences. Under the Louisiana Wage Payment Act, employees are entitled to their accrued vacation pay upon termination of employment. If an employer violates the act, they could owe either 90 days of wages at the employee’s daily rate of pay or the full wages from when the employee’s demand for payment is made until the employer pays or tenders the amount due, whichever is less. This penalty is in addition to the unpaid wages owed to the employee. Do the employers also charge attorney fees? If an employee files a well-founded lawsuit for unpaid vacation pay, the employer may also be liable for the employee’s reasonable attorney fees if proven guilty. Employees can file a lawsuit three days after making the first demand for unpaid wages after resignation or termination. What are summary proceedings? Louisiana Wage Payment Act allows employees to take advantage of ‘summary proceedings’ to resolve non-payment issues rapidly. It provided expedited legal procedures for resolving disputes related to wage payments between employers and employees. Summary proceedings allow employees to have a hearing set almost immediately on filing wage disputes based on the case’s merit, leaving little time for employers to prepare for trial. How can Truein help with paid time-off management for Louisiana based businesses? Truein is designed to be a complete time and attendance tracking solution for employers across industries.

If you are new to the screening process, here are a few things to consider. Look for relevant experience: You will likely receive applications with varying experiences.

If you have some specific requirements, look for their familiarity with cleaning techniques, equipment, and safety protocols requirements for the job.

An ideal onboarding and training process includes introducing new hires to company policies, procedures, and safety protocols. Give them hands-on training in cleaning techniques and equipment operation under the supervision of experienced staff. If they will be working with specific properties or locations, they should be given a tour of where they will be working. Before you put them in service, review client expectations and any special requests. Also, cleaning staff should receive ongoing training and performance evaluations to ensure continuous improvement. These four steps can simplify cleaning business hiring. Following these steps, you can hire the right employees for your cleaning or janitorial business. How do you prepare for hiring cleaners? Hiring cleaners for your business requires preparation, and there are some prerequisites you must complete before you start hiring and onboarding the right candidates. You must have the employer identification number (EIN) for cleaning business hiring. You can obtain EIN through the IRS. Your business should be registered with the state labor department to remain compliant for hiring. All businesses are required to report new hiring to their states. Depending on your location, you must disclose employee information to your state’s new-hire reporting agency . You must have the right payroll and record-keeping solutions in place. Get all legal requirements completed, such as workers’ compensation insurance, employment contract or at-will agreement, employee handbook, etc. Collect the necessary information via personal data form for payroll purposes, disability, family leave, and other federal policies. Get your business in shape to allow employees to work in a safe environment. For this, you must create standard operating procedures for tasks, set up workplace safety programs, order uniforms and safety gear for cleaners, etc. Also, you must create a channel for cleaners to report issues, ask questions, or seek assistance when needed.

Traits to look for when hiring cleaning staff When customers hire a cleaning service, they expect the staff to be polite, dedicated, and experienced. This is why, when hiring cleaning staff, you should look for individuals with the right skills and personal attributes. Here are vital traits to look for when hiring cleaners: 1. Experience and skills: While if you are hiring freshers, then knowledge is not necessary, previous experience and cleaning skills can be a bonus. Assess their familiarity with cleaning chemicals, equipment, and techniques relevant to your business’s needs. 2. Reliability: If your cleaners work unsupervised, it is a paramount trait. Dependable employees are reliable as they adhere to schedules, meet deadlines, and maintain consistent quality in their cleaning services. You can use the references in their application to know about their past job attendance and reliability. 3. Adaptability and problem-solving skills: It is common for cleaning staff to encounter unexpected situations or challenges. It would help if you looked for individuals who can adapt to changing circumstances and solve problems effectively. When cleaners can solve problems, big and small, independently, they can work without supervision. 4. Friendliness and approachable: Interaction with clients is part of the job if your cleaning business offers residential or commercial cleaning. Your employees must be courteous, respectful, and able to handle client requests or complaints professionally. Evaluate a candidate’s customer service skills before you hire them. 5. Trustworthiness and integrity: Given the nature of the cleaning work, it often involves being in clients’ private spaces. Therefore, the trustworthiness of the cleaning staff is crucial.

As cleaning companies often work in clients’ personal spaces, it is necessary to conduct background checks to ensure candidates have a clean criminal record. 4. Final interview (optional) Conduct a final interview with top candidates to discuss terms of employment, including pay, benefits, work schedules, and company policies. At this step, you extend formal job offers to selected candidates and ensure they understand and accept the terms and conditions of employment. Common problems and solutions for hiring cleaning staff Cleaning companies hiring have some common problems. Familiarity with these problems can help you create the right strategies and solutions to overcome these challenges. Let’s have a look at some common problems. 1. You take too long to reply to candidates Cleaning staff turnover is common, and there is always demand for janitorial service providers, so you must quickly reply to eligible candidates to avoid challenges in finding the right people to join your workforce. Therefore, you should promptly reply to potential candidates and offer them competitive wages and benefits to attract and retain them. Also, you should create a positive work environment and recognize and reward good performance. 2. Using manual data entry for candidate tracking If you are a small business and have limited hiring needs, then you can trust the good old spreadsheets to maintain records of candidates. However, to become efficient in hiring candidates, you must find an alternative to manually inputting applicant information. Remember that tasks performed manually hinder scalability, making it challenging to expand your operations. Automate application screening and data management with software solutions so you spend less time entering data into spreadsheets and more time maintaining your business. 3. You handle hiring on your own As a business owner, you have several responsibilities to take care of. You cannot assume the sole responsibility for reviewing resumes and contacting candidates, as it will slow down the hiring workflow. Suppose you struggle with finding time for other responsibilities because you are busy scheduling interviews and reviewing resumes and applications most of the time. In that case, consider hiring a virtual assistant (VA) or utilizing software to streamline these processes. Conclusion This guide provides steps to establish an effective cleaning staff hiring process that ensures you select and retain qualified individuals who can meet your business’s or client’s cleaning needs. Hiring candidates with the right traits and qualifications can build a strong and reliable cleaning team that effectively meets your client’s needs.

What's an alternative to hiring a cleaner? An alternative to hiring a full-time or part-time cleaner is considering professional cleaning services or outsourcing your cleaning needs to a cleaning company. These companies typically have a team of trained cleaners who can provide one-time or recurring cleaning services for your home or business. Hiring a cleaning service allows you to access cleaning expertise without the responsibilities of hiring and managing an in-house cleaner. It can be a cost-effective and flexible solution for many individuals and businesses. 2. When should I hire more cleaning employees? There can be various scenarios when you can require more cleaning employees. This includes: Increased demand for your cleaning services- If the workload exceeds the capacity of your current cleaning staff, resulting in longer response times or compromised quality of service, it’s time to hire additional employees. Seasonal variations may also require hiring more staff during peak periods to manage the increased demand- Suppose your current cleaning staff is consistently overworked, experiencing burnout, or taking frequent leaves of absence. In that case, it’s a sign that you need to hire more employees to distribute the workload effectively. Recent Blogs How to Manage Shift Schedules for Electrical Contractors?

Understanding these laws is necessary to ensure compliance with state regulations and help employers establish a positive work environment for employees. As of 2024, there are several aspects of Nebraska PTO laws that include vacation policies, sick leave, family leave, bereavement leave, jury duty leave, military leave, voting leave, and holiday leave. We understand it can be overwhelming for any employer, so we created this guide on Nebraska PTO laws. Read on to learn more about these laws and how you can establish fair and consistent policies that benefit both employees and the organization. Table of Contents Vacation Policies in Nebraska: What Can Employers Offer? Use-It-or-Lose-It Policies: Are They Allowed in Nebraska? Is vacation time treated as wages in Nebraska? Sick Leave in Nebraska: What Employers Need to Know Family Leave in Nebraska: Maternity, Paternity, and More Bereavement Leave: Is It Required in Nebraska? Jury Duty Leave in Nebraska: What's the Employer's Role? Military Leave: What Protections Exist in Nebraska? Voting Leave: What's Allowed in Nebraska? Holiday Leave in Nebraska: What Employers Can Decide How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion Vacation Policies in Nebraska: What Can Employers Offer? Nebraska law does not mandate specific vacation policies for employers, providing flexibility in designing vacation benefits. Therefore, employers have full discretion in creating vacation policies tailored to their business needs depending on their industry and workforce. However, a business’s vacation policies, including accrual rates, carryover limits, and usage guidelines, must be clearly communicated to employees through employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements. Furthermore, employers must adhere to the agreed-upon vacation policies. Additionally, employers should review and update their vacation policies to align with current regulations and industry standards. Use-It-or-Lose-It Policies: Are They Allowed in Nebraska? In Nebraska, ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ vacation policies are legally prohibited. The ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ policy stipulates that employees must use their accrued vacation time within a certain period, usually by year-end, or forfeit. Employers use such policies to encourage employees to take time off for rest and rejuvenation, aligning with the employer’s workforce management strategies. Nevada is one of the four states, including California, Nebraska, and Montana, that prohibit the use of use-it-or-lose-it policies. However, employers can cap the vacation time earned to a certain number of hours depending on their business requirements. Employers should ensure that their policies are well-documented and understood by all employees to avoid confusion and potential disputes. Is vacation time treated as wages in Nebraska? Paid vacation time is a fringe benefit legally classified as earned wages. Therefore, once vacation time is earned, it cannot be forfeited. Any accrued vacation time earned is considered wage, and employers must honor it per their established policy. Additionally, if employers offer any PTO, they must be clear about how vacation time is accrued and treated upon an employee’s separation from the company. If the employer’s policy or employee contract states that accrued vacation is paid out upon termination, the employer must comply with this policy. Sick Leave in Nebraska: What Employers Need to Know Nebraska does not have any state law governing sick leave. The state follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guidelines. Employers should be familiar with the FMLA regulations to create policies based on the terms and conditions for accruing, requesting, and using sick leave, including eligibility criteria, and accrual rates. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) The federal law provides eligible employees with job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. All employers with 50 or more employees should offer up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. To be eligible for sick leave under FMLA, employees must meet the following criteria: Employees must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours the previous year. Employees should be working at a location that employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. While FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave, in certain circumstances, such as military caregiver leave, employees may be entitled to up to 26 weeks of time off. An employee can use sick leave time under FMLA for one of the following reasons: Employees may take FMLA leave for their own serious health conditions. Birth or adoption of a child and bonding with the newborn or newly adopted child within one year of the birth or placement. Employees can also use the sick leave time to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness in the line of duty. Family Leave in Nebraska: Maternity, Paternity, and More Nebraska PTO payout laws do not include family leave policies such as maternity or paternity at the state level but follow federal FMLA guidelines. Employees in the state can apply for maternity or paternity leave during significant life events such as the birth or adoption of a child. The FMLA provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for adopting a child or pregnancy. As mentioned above, the same eligibility criteria apply for family leave under FMLA. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is another federal law that employers in the state must abide by. It prohibits discrimination against pregnant employees regarding hiring, firing, promotion, or any other workplace-related event. Nebraska Adoption Leave Another law applicable for family leave is the Nebraska Adoption Leave, which allows employees to take time off for adoption. Under this act, an employee can avail the same leave as under maternity or paternity policies for adopting a child under the age of 9 or adopting a child under the age of 19 with special needs requirements. Under all conditions, maternity or paternity leave is unpaid. Bereavement Leave: Is It Required in Nebraska? There is no statutory requirement in Nebraska for employers to provide bereavement leave. Therefore, it is at the discretion of employers to provide this type of leave, its duration, and whether it is paid or unpaid. Typically, most employers in the state offer bereavement leave of up to 2 days to support employees during difficult times. Jury Duty Leave in Nebraska: What's the Employer's Role? Jury duty is a civic responsibility that requires individuals to serve on a jury and participate in the judicial process. Nebraska mandates that all employers provide employees time off to fulfill their jury duty obligations. Nebraska not only requires employers to provide employees with time off from work to serve on a jury but also to pay them for time spent on jury selection or jury duty. During jury duty leave, employers cannot terminate, demote, or otherwise penalize employees for fulfilling their civic duty as jurors. While employers are required to pay normal wages to employees for the time on jury duty, they can reduce their wages by $35 a day (the amount paid to jurors by the court). Additionally, Nebraska law prohibits employers from requiring employees to use accrued vacation or sick leave for jury duty absences. Military Leave: What Protections Exist in Nebraska? Military leave provisions in the Nebraska state support employees who serve in the armed forces, including National Guard and reserves members. All employers must follow the guidelines of the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) to uphold their legal obligations and demonstrate support for military service members. As per USERRA, members of the National Guard, reserves, or other branches of the armed forces must be provided up to 5 years of unpaid leave for active duty. Also, eligible employees should be provided group healthcare benefits for up to 24 months. Military leave can be used for active duty or military training and drills. Nebraska State Law provides the same level of job protection and benefits as provided under USERRA to the members of the Nebraska National Guard and called for active duty. The Nebraska Family Military Leave Act (NFMLA) The Nebraska Family Military Leave Act is a state-specific law providing additional protections and benefits to employees who are parents or spouses of armed forces or National Guard members. Employers with 15 to 50 employees must provide eligible employees with up to 15 days of unpaid leave for duty requirements. Employers with 50 or more employees must provide eligible employees with up to 30 days of unpaid leave. To be eligible for military leave under NFMLA, employees must fulfill the FMLA criteria, i.e., employed with the current employer for at least 12 months or worked at least 1,250 hours the previous year. Voting Leave: What's Allowed in Nebraska? Nebraska PTO laws mandate that employers provide employees up to 2 hours of paid time off to exercise their right to vote. All eligible employees can take time off work to vote in local, state, and federal elections. However, if the time exceeds 2 hours, employers are not required to pay for time off. Voting leave allows employees who do not have sufficient time outside of working hours to vote. Employers must allow employees to take this leave without penalty or retaliation and cannot require employees to use accrued vacation or sick leave for voting purposes. Holiday Leave in Nebraska: What Employers Can Decide Nebraska observes 12 state holidays, but private employers are not required to provide paid or unpaid holidays to employees. If employers choose to offer holiday leave, they should consider the holidays in the state. Here is a complete list of holidays in Nebraska in 2024: Holiday Observed in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Washington’s Birthday Monday, February 19 3rd Monday in February Arbor Day Friday, April 26 Last Friday in April Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Independence Day Thursday, July 4 July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 1st Monday in September Columbus Day Monday, October 14 2nd Monday in October Veterans Day Monday, November 11 November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 4th Thursday of November Day after Thanksgiving Friday, November 29 Friday after Thanksgiving Christmas Day Wednesday, Dec. 25 December 25 How can Truein help with Paid time off management?

Maryland’s regulations on overtime pay are pivotal for employers to understand and comply with in 2024. According to Maryland labor law, employees are generally entitled to receive overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular hourly wage for hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. For employers, it is essential to fulfill this entitlement to overtime pay as it is a critical aspect of labor law that ensures fair compensation for employees working extended hours. We created this guide to help employers understand Maryland overtime laws and their implications to avoid potential legal complications. Table of Contents Maryland Minimum Wage Tipped Minimum Wage Subminimum wage Exceptions to minimum wage Payment laws Maryland living wage law Overtime Laws in Maryland Break laws Maryland breastfeeding laws Leave requirements Child labor laws Hiring laws Termination laws Discrimination laws Occupational safety Miscellaneous laws How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion Maryland Minimum Wage The Fair Wage Act of 2023 , passed by the General Assembly in May 2023, has significantly increased Maryland’s minimum wage by $15 per hour from January 1, 2024. The Fair Wage Act of 2023 expedited the planned increase set for January 1, 2025. The new act marks a substantial rise from the former rates of $13.50 per hour for larger employers with 15 or more employees and $12.80 for smaller businesses. However, the minimum wage for tipped employees remains unchanged at $3.63 per hour. Montgomery County has a distinction where employers with more than 50 employees should pay a minimum wage of $17 per hour. Also, in the country, tipped employees must be paid $4 per hour. Depending on the location of your business, compliance with these wage standards is critical to avoid legal liabilities, including treble damages and criminal penalties in some cases​. Tipped Minimum Wage A tipped employee works in an industry where they regularly and customarily receive tips amounting to $30 per month. As of 2024, Maryland’s tipped minimum wage is $3.63 per hour. This rate is applicable across the state, regardless of the employer’s size. No change is made to the tipped minimum wage under the Fair Wage Act of 2023. However, this minimum wage is applicable as long as the tipped employees earn at least $12.50 per hour, including tips. Subminimum wage In Maryland, employees under 20 can be paid the subminimum wage. Under these regulations, new employees under 20 can be paid a minimum wage of $4.25 for the first 90 days. Minimum Wage Regulation also states that full-time high school or college students can be paid a minimum wage of $10.63(no less than 85% of the regular minimum wage rate for up to 20 work hours per week). Exceptions to minimum wage Specific categories of employees are exempted from the minimum wage regulations. These exceptions include: Agricultural workers and some agricultural branches Food and drink establishments with annual earnings of less than $400,000. Outside salesmen Minors and volunteers in charitable, educational, and religious organizations Drive-in theatre workers Industries involved in the canning, freezing, and packing of fruits, vegetables, seafood, or poultry Employers in these sectors must familiarize themselves with the specific details of the federal and state minimum wage laws because, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), if an employee is subjected to federal and state minimum wage laws, then the employer must pay whichever is higher. Payment laws Maryland labor laws mandate that employers pay their employees at least twice a month on predetermined dates. Executive, professional, and administrative employees are exempted from this regulation and can be paid less frequently based on employment agreements. In June 2021, Maryland passed the Secure Maryland Wage Act, which increases the minimum wage for employees working in specific locations with heightened security interests, like Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and Pennsylvania Station. Employees working in these locations earn a minimum wage of $13.50 per hour, with annual increases. These changes address high turnover and attract more people to work as janitors, non-TSA security officers, ramp workers, ticker agents, etc. Maryland living wage law Maryland’s Living Wage Law is a notable regulation applied to all private businesses that contract with the state government. According to the law, employers working on state contracts must pay their employees a living wage above the standard minimum wage. The applicability of this law is based on the nature of the contract, specifically: Maryland living wage law applies to service contracts with the state valued at $100,000 or more. Employees who spend 50% of their time on government contracts. Employees not working on such projects are not eligible for higher wages. Additionally, the living wage varies by county. Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Baltimore, Howard, Montgomery, and Prince George’s counties provide a living wage rate of $14.55 per hour, while all other counties offer $10.93. Overtime Laws in Maryland Maryland has no specific overtime laws and applies federal Fair Labor Standards Act laws to all employers. Simply put, Maryland overtime laws mandate that all employers pay 1.5 times the regular wage for hours worked over 40 a week. It applies to all types of employment and industries, with some exceptions, including certain salaried employees, workers in specific care institutions, and recreational establishments. Employers must understand that Maryland overtime laws don’t recognize 8-hour per-day schedules for overtime. To be eligible for overtime pay, employees must have worked over 40 hours per week. Break laws Maryland has no laws for breaks, and it is solely on employers’ discretion to allow for such breaks. The only exception is for minor workers, who must be provided 30 minutes for every 5 hours worked. Still, most employers in the state provide rest and meal breaks to ensure a productive workforce. Employees who provide work and meal breaks must follow federal standards. Employers should compensate employees if they work through meal times, and if no work is performed during meal breaks, they can be unpaid. For retail establishments with 50 or more employees, the Maryland Healthy Retail Employee Act mandates certain breaks based on the length of the work shift. Employers should ensure compliance with these laws. Maryland breastfeeding laws No Maryland state laws for breastfeeding breaks exist. As a result, federal breastfeeding laws are applicable. All employers should provide non-exempt (hourly) employees reasonable break times for breastfeeding for up to one year after the child’s birth. As per federal standards, employers must provide a private space (other than a bathroom) for breastfeeding. However, there are no guidelines on the duration and frequency of these breaks. The employer can determine it. Furthermore, small businesses with fewer than 50 employees may be exempt from providing breastfeeding breaks and arrangements if they can demonstrate significant hardship. Leave requirements Maryland has a full spectrum of employee leave requirements, including required and non-required leaves. The state follows the Maryland Healthy Working Families Act and federal FLSA laws to ensure workers get enough leaves for work-life balance. Required leaves in Maryland Sick and family leave: Sick and family leave is mandatory in Maryland, and all employers are required to provide sick leave. As per the regulations, employer sick leave accrues at 1 hour for every 30 hours worked. As a result, employees can accrue up to 40 sick leave hours in a year. This leave allows employees to take time off for personal illness, to care for a sick family member, or parental leave related to the birth or adoption of a child. Employers with 15 or more employees must provide paid sick leave, while those with 14 or fewer employees should offer unpaid sick leave. Jury duty leave Federal as well as Maryland Code, Court and Judicial Proceedings provide legal protection for employees serving jury duty. Employees must be provided leave for jury duty without any hassle and should be reinstated when they return. Voting time leave During elections, employees in Maryland have the civil right to be granted time off to vote. Employers must provide 2 hours of paid voting time to ensure employees can fulfill their civic duty. However, employers can ask employees to provide proof of voting. Domestic violence or sexual assault leave This leave is for employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. It allows time off for medical care, legal proceedings, or dealing with the aftermath of such incidents. Employees can use their paid sick leave hours in these circumstances if they or a family member suffers from domestic or sexual violence or stalking. Emergency response leave Employees of emergency response teams such as the Civil Air Patrol, volunteer firefighters, or any civil defense organization are entitled to leave to respond to emergencies. No employer can take retaliatory actions such as demoting, cutting pay, or discharging such employees from their jobs. These employees are entitled to adequate time off as a response to emergency events declared by the Governor. For state employees, emergency response leave can be up to 15 days per year if certified American Red Cross volunteers and their services are needed for a Level 2 or higher-level disaster. Organ and bone donation leave Maryland requires that all private employers support charitable acts such as organ or bone marrow donation by ensuring employees can take the necessary time off for medical procedures and recovery. Private employees must be provided up to 60 days of unpaid leave for organ donations and 30 days for bone marrow donation. For state employees, the limit is 30 days for organ donations and 7 days for bone marrow donation. Military leave Maryland military law facilitates employees’ commitments to the National Guard or Reserves. Employers are required to provide 15 days of paid leave for deployment or military training. This leave is essential for allowing service members to fulfill their military obligations. Non-required leaves Non-required leaves can also be part of the employment contract. Such leaves are offered at the employer’s discretion and are not legally mandated. However, employers must communicate their leave policies to employees and administer them fairly and consistently to avoid potential disputes or legal challenges. Bereavement leave Employers can choose to provide unpaid time for employees to grieve and manage affairs following the death of a close family member. Vacation leave Vacation leave can be offered to improve work-life balance and offer employees a chance for rest and recovery. Holiday leave It recognizes federal and state holidays. While private employers are not legally required to do so, public employers must offer 11 paid holidays annually Child labor laws Maryland’s child labor laws regulate the employment of minors to ensure their safety and well-being. As per these laws, children under 14 are not permitted to work. For minors aged 14-17, certain restrictions apply: All minors between 14 and 17 must get a work permit from the Maryland Department of Labor . They can work 3 hours a day during a school day and 8 hours on non-school days. They can only work between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. except on Labor Day, when they can work until 9 p.m. For minors aged 16 and 17: They are also required to get work permits. Their work hours have fewer restrictions and depend on the nature of work. However, they must have 8 consecutive hours of rest per 24 hours for health and well-being. Additionally, no minor can be employed in prohibited occupations that include: Manufacturing plants related to explosives Logging, mining, or working with power-driven machinery Operating heavy machinery like lifts, elevators, etc. Machinery maintenance Blast furnaces Working at docks or railroads Driving motor vehicles Erection and repair of electrical components Distilleries Hiring laws Maryland’s hiring laws govern various aspects of the recruitment and hiring process, ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all job applicants. The state follows The Job Applicant Fairness Act that provides no candidate is discriminated against based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, religion, age, disability, and national origin. The act also prohibits employers from asking employees for credit reports to make hiring decisions. Termination laws In Maryland, termination laws are as per the “employment-at-will” doctrine. It allows either the employer or the employee to end the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, or no reason at all, as long as the termination is not illegal. However, this does not permit termination based on discriminatory or retaliatory reasons. Discrimination laws Maryland has a very robust anti-discrimination law to protect the rights of employees. No employer can have discriminatory practices based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or disability. The State of Maryland Commission on Civil Rights ensures equal employment opportunities. It protects workers from unfair treatment or biases in hiring, promotion, job assignments, termination, and other aspects of employment. Occupational safety Maryland follows the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) guidelines and state-specific regulations under Maryland Occupational Safety and Health (MOSH) . MOSH provides employers with resources that provide guidelines for on-site inspections, consultations, educational programs, and outreach to ensure workplace safety and health. The law focuses on setting and enforcing standards and collaborates with businesses to improve safety measures. Understanding and implementing these safety standards will help employers to provide a safe working environment and comply with legal requirements. Miscellaneous laws Maryland also has several miscellaneous labor laws that employers must be aware of. It includes: 1. Whistleblower protection laws : Maryland whistleblower laws apply to only public employees, and private employees are not protected under these laws. These regulations protect public employees from retaliation for reporting illegal activities such as mismanagement of public resources and violating laws. 2.

That’s why employers need to comply with the latest legal mandates. For any business, legal compliance with the New Jersey PTO laws is mandatory for compliance and fostering a positive workplace culture. We created this guide on New Jersey PTO law to help employers understand various regulations and stay abreast of any changes to ensure compliance and strategically manage employee leave. Table of Contents Paid Sick Leave Paid Vacation, Holiday, and Personal Time Laws Permitting Sick Time and Medical Leaves Jury Duty Leave Victims of Crimes Payments for Unused Time Off Rollover policy in New Jersey Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay NJ policy on payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination Bereavement Leave Military Leave Voting Leave State Holidays How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion Paid Sick Leave As of 2024, under the New Jersey PTO Law, paid sick leave is a mandatory provision employers must offer their employees. All employees in the state are entitled to accrue 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers can limit the yearly accumulated paid sick leave to 40 hours annually. The accrued paid sick leave can be used for various reasons besides the employee’s medical needs. It can be used for family illness, attending to matters related to domestic or sexual violence, and attending school meetings related to a child’s health or disability. Accrual of paid sick leave starts from the first day of employment. However, employers can put a waiting period of 120 days, after which new hires can use their accrued paid sick leave. Furthermore, employees can carry over 40 hours of unused paid sick leave from one year to the next. Employers are not required to pay for unused paid sick leave upon termination of an employee. For employers, this means implementing a system that accurately tracks employee hours and accrued sick leave. It’s vital to have clear policies that align with the state requirements, ensuring that employees know their entitlements and the process for availing of sick leave. Paid Vacation, Holiday, and Personal Time New Jersey has no laws mandating paid vacation, holiday, or personal time off. It is at the employer’s discretion to offer PTO. Typically, most organizations offer these benefits to attract and retain talent. If an employer in New Jersey decides to provide PTO, they must adhere to their established policies and procedures without any discrimination. Employers must define eligibility, accrual, and usage rules for PTO offerings in their employee handbooks, contracts, and offer letters. Any changes to these policies should be communicated effectively to all employees to prevent misunderstandings and potential legal issues. Laws Permitting Sick Time and Medical Leaves Several New Jersey PTO laws permit employees to take time off beyond standard sick leave, extending to broader medical leaves. Employers must know the various laws allowing employees time off for medical needs. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows all eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave to attend to health-related circumstances, such as caring for a family member with a severe health condition or bonding with a new child. These laws mandate job protection and can vary based on the employer’s size and the employee’s tenure and hours worked. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have worked with the current employer for at least one year or worked 1,250 hours the previous year. FMLA applies to all employers with 50 or more employees or employees working at a location where 50 or more workers work within a 75-mile radius. An employee can use FMLA sick leave for the employee’s serious health condition, the care of a family member with a serious health condition, or the birth or adoption of a child. New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) The New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) is another law that allows workers in the state to take time off for medical needs beyond paid sick leave. It is a crucial piece of legislation that provides eligible employees with job-protected leave to care for needy family members. To support the well-being of employees and their families, NJFLA ensures that workers can take time off to address significant family-related matters without fear of adverse employment actions. All employers with 30 or more employees must provide up to 12 weeks of time off within 24 months to eligible employees to care for an ill family member or bond with a child. To qualify for NJFLA, employees should have worked for their employer for at least 12 months and have accumulated at least 1,000 hours of work during the preceding 12-month period. Leave under NJFLA can be unpaid, paid, or both, depending on the employer’s policies. Jury Duty Leave In New Jersey, the law requires employers to provide unpaid time off for employees summoned to serve on a jury. While this leave is not compensated, employers are prohibited from penalizing or otherwise disadvantaging employees for fulfilling their civic duty. It is also necessary for employers to allow employees to return to their positions without any repercussions. While private employees are not required to pay employees for jury duty leave, public employees are paid depending on their employment policies. However, the state pays any employee serving as a juror in New Jersey $5.00 daily. Employers should have a clear policy regarding jury duty leave, which should be communicated in the employee handbook or through other internal communications. This policy should outline the process for employees to notify their employer of the need for jury duty leave and any documentation required. Victims of Crimes As of 2024, victims of crimes have the legal right to take up to 20 days under the New Jersey Security and Financial Empowerment Act (NJ SAFE Act) . This PTO is available for employees if they or a member of their immediate family is a victim of sexual assault or domestic violence. Employers should provide victims of crimes unpaid leave to participate in court proceedings related to the crime. Employers must allow this time off, recognizing the importance of an employee’s role in the judicial process and their need for recovery and support. Additionally, employers must be sensitive and discreet in handling such situations, ensuring confidentiality and understanding. Payments for Unused Time Off As of 2024, no New Jersey PTO law mandates employers to pay employees for unused time off, such as vacation days. The decision to pay for unused time off depends on the employer’s established policy or employment contract. If the employer’s policy or agreement includes such provisions, they are legally bound to honor them. If an employer offers payments for unused time off, they should have clear, written policies regarding the accrual, use, and payment of unused vacation time. These policies should be consistently applied and communicated to all employees to avoid potential disputes and ensure fairness. Rollover policy in New Jersey New Jersey allows a use-it-or-lose-it policy, meaning employers are not required to allow employees to carry over unused PTO from one year to the next. However, paid sick time up to 40 hours can be rolled over to the following year. The maximum limit that can be carried over and the specifics of these provisions can vary based on the employer’s policy. It’s essential for employers to clearly define their rollover policies in their employee handbooks, detailing how much leave can be carried over and any conditions or limitations associated with this process. Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay In New Jersey, paid time off is not considered as wages. Therefore, there are no statutory provisions to address vacation pay. However, labor laws stipulate that employers must adhere to their established policies or employment contracts if they offer vacation benefits. Employers should have comprehensive vacation pay policies to avoid misunderstanding or potential legal disputes, including how vacation time is accrued, used, and compensated upon termination or resignation. NJ policy on payment of accrued, unused vacation on termination As there is no legislation for payment of PTO in New Jersey, the payment of accrued, unused vacation upon termination is guided by the employer’s policy or employment agreement. If the employer’s policy states that employees are entitled to payment for unused vacation time at termination, they must adhere to the agreed terms of employment. Employers have no obligation to pay on termination without an established policy for payment of accrued, unused vacation. This makes it necessary that employers must ensure that policies regarding vacation pay upon termination are clearly stated and consistently applied. Bereavement Leave There is no provision to provide bereavement leave in New Jersey PTO law. Most employers offer this leave to employees to allow them enough time to grieve and deal with the loss of a family member. Employers need to consider the impact of bereavement leave on their workforce, and offering bereavement leave can be a significant aspect of supporting employees during difficult times. Military Leave A combination of federal and state laws governs military leave in New Jersey. The key federal law is the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which applies nationwide. USERRA ensures that individuals who serve or have served in the Armed Forces, Reserve, National Guard, or other uniformed services are not disadvantaged in their civilian careers and can return to their employment after their military service. Under USERRA, all employers should provide employees unpaid leave for military service for up to 5 years to serve in duty. Furthermore, such employees should be provided group healthcare benefits for up to 24 months. Employers must reemploy returning service members in the position they would have attained had they not been absent for military service, with the same seniority, status, pay, and other rights and benefits determined by seniority. In addition to the USERRA, state law further protects the rights of employees who take leave to serve active duty in the armed forces. However, it doesn’t protect individuals working in temporary positions. Military leave is unpaid under the federal and state laws. Employees are protected from termination except for cause for one year after their reinstatement if their military service was for more than 180 days. The protection lasts for six months for service between 31 and 180 days. Voting Leave Voting leave is not required by law in New Jersey. It depends on employers’ policies to allow employees to fulfill their civic duty during work hours. Still, most employers in New Jersey provide time off for employees who need more time outside of working hours to vote. Any time off for voting is unpaid and depends on the employer’s discretion. Employers should promote civic participation while balancing the operational needs of their business. Being supportive of employees’ voting rights can also positively reflect on the company’s commitment to civic responsibilities and employee well-being. State Holidays New Jersey has 13 recognized state holidays, but private employees are not obligated to provide paid or unpaid holidays. However, public employees should be given holidays on officially recognized days. Here are the state holidays for 2024: Holiday Observed in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Presidents Day Monday, February 19 3rd Monday in February Good Friday Friday, March 29 2 days before Easter Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Juneteenth (!)

The onus is on the employers to understand the Washington overtime law requirements and include them in their company policies for compliance. The employment policies are determined by the laws and regulations regarding overtime eligibility, wages, exemptions, and requirements. Understanding these laws is beyond mere legal obligations; adherence to these regulations ensures employees receive appropriate compensation for their labor. This article explores the Washington overtime law, including definitions and criteria, encompassing overview, compliance strategies, and legal implications. Table of Contents Background of Washington State Overtime Laws Criteria for Exemption Employer Compliance Strategies Salary adjustments Reclassifying employees Managing work hours Conducting job duties audits Implementing flexible staffing arrangements Training managers Legal Implications of Non-Compliance Financial penalties Legal actions and lawsuits Audits and investigations Impact on employee relations Employee Rights and Protections Right to overtime pay Accurate classification Transparent information Protection from retaliation How can Truein help with overtime pay management? Conclusion Background of Washington State Overtime Laws Historically, these laws have been shaped by federal guidelines and state-specific mandates, aiming to balance the workforce’s needs with the operational realities of businesses. The overtime laws were instituted as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in 1938 in Washington. Today, it sets the standards for various aspects of labor law, including minimum wage, recordkeeping, and overtime pay. The overtime laws in Washington State have evolved significantly, reflecting a growing emphasis on worker rights and equitable pay practices. Some of the most significant changes include: Increased salary threshold to allow salaried employees to get overtime pay. As of 2024, according to federal guidelines, a salaried employee earning at least $684 a week is exempt from overtime pay. This limit is to increase by 2.5 times by 2028. Job duty tests to determine if an employee is exempt are revised. The updated policies streamlined the process into a single test instead of two. Special provisions for exempt categories are made: Executives, administrators, and professionals will be exempt if their duties involve high-level responsibilities. Computer professionals must earn 2.5x the minimum state wage rate to be exempt by 2028 (incrementing yearly). Outside salespeople are defined as individuals who primarily get contracts or sell or work away from the office. Criteria for Exemption Under the Washington overtime law, deciding which salaried employee is entitled to overtime pay involves testing them at three levels. Salary Basis Test : This criterion requires that an employee in Washington state be paid a predetermined and fixed salary that is not subject to reduction due to variations in the quality or quantity of work performed. Salary Level Test : Washington has specific salary thresholds for exempting employees from overtime. Since January 1, 2020, the salary threshold has increased yearly and will continue till 2028. If a salaried employee receives less than the threshold in 2024, they are entitled to overtime pay. Job Duties Test : It involves evaluating the primary duties to establish whether they are executive, administrative, professional, or outside sales-related. Each category has specific requirements ; for example, executive employees must have management as their primary duty and regularly direct the work of at least two full-time employees. Employers must be aware of the criteria requirements when classifying their employees. Misclassification can lead to legal issues and undermine the laws’ intent to protect worker rights and ensure fair compensation for overtime work. Employer Compliance Strategies As an employer, you must provide a positive work environment for your employees while ensuring compliance with various Washington overtime law requirements. If you need help to develop strategies and proactive measures for compliance, here are some recommendations. Salary adjustments As the salary threshold for exempt employees is increasing every year, employers may need to adjust the salaries of certain employees to meet the exemption thresholds. This will require an analysis of current salary structures and the necessary changes to align with the state’s salary level test for exempt employees. Reclassifying employees Some employees may need to be reclassified from exempt to non-exempt based on the updated criteria. Employers must inform them about the reclassification and explain the changes in their eligibility for overtime. Managing work hours Employers can implement effective work-hour management strategies if the overtime cost is too high. This includes scheduling adjustments, redistributing workloads, and ensuring non-exempt employees are not exploiting overtime work privileges. Conducting job duties audits As exemption requirements also include job descriptions and duties, employers must ensure that employees are classified correctly according to the job duties test. These audits help identify roles that may have evolved and need reclassification. Implementing flexible staffing arrangements Flexible staffing, such as using part-time or temporary workers during peak periods, can help manage workloads and reduce overtime. Training managers Managers and supervisors should know the importance of accurate timekeeping and the legal implications of improperly authorizing overtime. Legal Implications of Non-Compliance Non-compliance with Washington State overtime law can be costly for employers, sometimes leading to penalties and legal action. Employers should be aware of these potential consequences to maintain legal compliance and ensure ethical business practices. Financial penalties Employers failing to comply with state and federal overtime laws are subject to financial penalties. Violators can face substantial penalties, including back pay for unpaid overtime, fines, and additional damages. For ongoing or widespread non-compliance, the cost can be too high. Legal actions and lawsuits Employees can take legal routes for non-compliance and violation of their overtime rights at the state and federal levels. Lawsuits can be costly court battles, settlements, and judgments against the employer. Audits and investigations The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries or federal authorities may conduct audits or investigations in response to complaints or as part of routine checks. These can result in further penalties and enforcement actions. Impact on employee relations Non-compliance affects the company’s reputation and leads to distrust among employees. It can also result in high turnover rates. Employee Rights and Protections Washington overtime law provides several rights to employees and protections to ensure they are fairly compensated for their work hours. Here are the critical aspects of these rights and the importance of upholding them. Right to overtime pay All non-exempt employees in Washington State are legally entitled to overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The overtime pay must be at least 1.5 times the employee’s regular hourly rate. Accurate classification Accurate classification of an employee is not only a federal mandate but also a right of the employee. They should be correctly classified as exempt or non-exempt based on the established criteria. Whether intentional or accidental, misclassification can violate an employee’s right to overtime pay. Transparent information Employees have the right to complete and accurate information about the job responsibilities, salary structure, and their classification and entitlements. This transparency is vital for ensuring that employees are aware of their rights and can take action if they believe those rights are being infringed. Protection from retaliation No employer can retaliate against employees for asserting their rights under the Washington overtime laws. This includes protection from being unfairly disciplined, demoted, or terminated for filing a complaint or inquiring about their overtime pay. Employees in the state have the right to pursue legal action if they believe their overtime rights have been violated. This can include filing complaints with the Department of Labor & Industries or seeking legal redress through the courts. How can Truein help with overtime pay management?

Furthermore, the earned paid time off under this law provides employees the right to use time off for any reason and not just medical needs. Therefore, employers must strategically implement these regulations to minimize operational disruptions while maximizing the benefits of a well-rested and satisfied workforce. Eligibility and Exemptions Under Nevada PTO law, all employees are covered except on-call workers, temporary staff, and seasonal workers. The law also applies to part-time workers, and all employees of large employers are eligible for paid leave. There are some other exemptions as well. All new employers are exempted from the Nevada PTO law for the first two years. Therefore, they are not required to provide any paid time off to their employees, irrespective of their business size. Also, employers that offer 40 hours of PTO annually are not required to follow the mandatory paid leave policy. While the law broadly covers many workers, the exemptions are still unclear, and employers are recommended to seek legal counsel when creating employment policies, depending on the nature of their job or industry. Employers must carefully review these exemptions to determine the law’s applicability to their staff accurately. Accrual Rate and Cap Nevada PTO laws, as of 2024, employers must provide eligible employees 0.01923 hours of paid leave for each hour of work. Employees accrue paid leave at no less than one hour for every 52 hours worked. It is a straightforward accrual rate for employers to calculate and manage paid leave. While employees accrue leave over time, there are cap limits that employers can put. Employers can limit the paid leave an employee can accrue in a year to 40 hours. Furthermore, employers can provide 40 hours of paid time off at the beginning of the year or let employees accrue PTO. Understanding and setting these caps by legal guidelines is essential for employers. It helps in maintaining a balance between providing fair employee benefits and managing business operations effectively. The common accrual cap is for 40 hours of accrued PTO. Still, some employers may set higher or lower limits depending on employee tenure, job classification, and industry norms. Waiting Period and Rollover Employers in Nevada can implement a waiting period before new employees can use paid leave. They can set a waiting period of 90 days for employees before they can use the earned PTO for any reason. The company’s leave policy must clearly define the waiting period to maintain transparency. Nevada allows employers to assert a “use or it lose it” policy requiring employees to use their earned PTO within the year. However, employees can roll over 40 hours of accrued PTO from one year to the next. The Nevada PTO law offers employers the discretion to set their policies. This includes deciding whether to allow the rolling over of unused leave and, if so, how much. Employers must judiciously establish these policies, considering the legal requirements and the implications for employee satisfaction and retention. Payment and Recordkeeping In Nevada, employers must ensure employees are compensated for their accrued paid time off at their regular pay rate. Additionally, employers should ensure that employees receive proper information regarding how their PTO is calculated. Accurate recordkeeping is also essential for compliance with Nevada PTO law. According to the Section 5 of NRS 608.0197 all employers in Nevada are required to maintain detailed records of accrued and used paid leave for each employee for at least a year. Sick Leave Nevada has federal and state laws regarding sick leave for employees. The state follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows eligible employees 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. To qualify for sick leave under FMLA, an employee must meet the following criteria: Employees must work for a covered employer with 50 or more employees, public agencies, and local educational agencies. Employees must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months or at least 1,250 hours last year. Also, unlike PTO in Nevada, which can be used as sick leave, any time off under FMLA should be used only for medical emergencies affecting the employee or their family members. FMLA allows eligible employees to take unpaid leave for the following reasons: Serious Health Condition: To address employees’ own severe health conditions that render them unable to perform essential job functions. Family Member’s Serious Health Condition: To care for a spouse, child, or parent with a severe health condition. Birth or Adoption: For a child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement. Qualifying Exigency: Employees with family members serving in the military can take FMLA leave for qualifying exigencies related to the military member’s covered active duty or call to covered active duty status. Maternity, Paternity, and FMLA Leave Nevada has both federal and state laws for maternity and paternity leave requirements. Maternity leave allows eligible employees to take time off from work due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. While Nevada does not have state-specific maternity leave laws, eligible employees may qualify for unpaid leave under the federal FMLA. FMLA provides eligible employees in the state with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for the birth and care of a newborn child, including prenatal care and recovery from childbirth. Like maternity leave, paternity leave rights are governed by FMLA, which provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for fathers and non-birthing parents to actively participate in the early stages of their child’s life and support their family’s well-being. Nevada also follows the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), ensuring that no employee is discriminated against at the workplace due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The Nevada Pregnant Workers Fairness Act All employers with 15 or more employees must provide their workers with reasonable accommodation or leave to deal with childbirth or other conditions related to pregnancy. It applied to each working day of the 20-week pregnancy. The Nevada Fair Employment Practices (FEP) The Nevada Fair Employment Practices Act is designed to promote fair and equal treatment in the workplace. It prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, or national origin. This act is enforced by the Nevada Equal Rights Commission (NERC) and is crucial for employers to understand as it impacts all aspects of employment, including PTO policies. Bereavement Leave Nevada PTO law does not mandate bereavement leave for employees. Still, many employers offer it as part of their comprehensive leave policies, allowing up to 2 days of unpaid leave. Bereavement leave typically allows employees to take time off for the death of a close family member. Jury Duty Leave In Nevada, employers are legally required to provide time off for employees called to serve on jury duty. Employees should be allowed to fulfill their civic responsibilities without fear of losing employment or facing retaliation. Private employers are not required to pay employees for jury duty time off. Such employees are paid a juror fee of $40 a day. Employers can ask employees to provide advance notice up to 3 days before jury duty. Also, employees cannot be made to use their sick leave or vacation time to fulfill their jury duty. Military Leave in Nevada Nevada adheres to both federal and state laws regarding military leave. The federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) governs military leave, ensuring that service members who leave their civilian jobs for military duty can return to their jobs with the same pay, benefits, and status. Under USERRA, employers must ensure that service members receive group healthcare benefits for up to 24 months when on active duty. Also, military leave is unpaid and can be up to 5 years, depending on the requirement. Upon returning from military leave, employees in Nevada are entitled to be reinstated to their former job or a comparable position. This includes the preservation of seniority, pension rights, and other benefits. Members of the Nevada National Guard are provided the same protections as under USERRA by the state law on military leave. The state law prohibits discrimination and retaliation against employees who take military leave. This includes any adverse employment action like demotion, pay reduction, or unwarranted disciplinary action. Voting Leave Nevada law encourages civic participation by providing voting leave for employees. Employers are required to give employees 1, 2, or 3 hours of paid time off to vote. The duration depends on the distance between the workplace and the polling station. If the distance is less than 2 miles, an hour of paid time off must be provided; two hours of paid time off should be provided if the distance is 2 to 10 miles, and if it’s more than 10 miles, 3 hours of paid time off should be given to vote. This duration is required to ensure that employees can exercise their voting rights without fear of losing wages or facing job repercussions. State Holidays There are 12 state-recognized holidays in Nevada, but private employers are not required to provide paid or unpaid holidays. Here is a complete list of holidays in Nevada in 2024: Holiday Observed in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Washington’s Birthday Monday, February 19 3rd Monday in February Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Juneteenth Wednesday, June 19 June 19 Independence Day Thursday, July 4 July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 1st Monday in September Nevada Day Monday, October 25 Last Friday in October Veterans Day Monday, November 11 November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 4th Thursday of November Family Day Friday, November 29 Day after Thanksgiving Christmas Day Wednesday, Dec. 25 December 25 Valid PTO Usage Nevada’s mandatory PTO law allows employees to use their paid time off for any reason without explaining to their employers. However, specifically, the statute, NRS 608.0197 , gives following as the valid reason for PTO usage: Caregiving to a family member Receiving medical or preventive care Treatment for a mental or physical issue Addressing other personal well-being needs This is not an exhaustive list, but some reasons PTO usage is valid. A complete list is available here . Rate of Pay Calculation As mentioned earlier, Nevada requires employers to pay the same hourly wages for PTO as their regular wages. However, a distinction is how regular hourly wages are calculated for salaried employees. The employer takes the hourly wage of the last 90 working days to calculate the rate of pay for PTO. For instance, if an employee in Nevada has worked 550 hours in the last 90 days and earned $25,000, their PTO rate will be $45.45 per hour. Recording PTO Employers must maintain detailed records of accrued and used paid leave for each employee for at least a year. This includes tracking the accrual rates, used leave, and any remaining leave balance. A bulletin informing employees of their rights under Nevada PTO law at the workplace must be displayed. Employee Rights When creating PTO policies in Nevada, employers should consider these employee rights: Employees can start using accrued PTO 90 days after starting the job. Employees have the right to use their paid time off for any valid reason without specifying the reason to their employers. Employees should receive payment for unused PTO if mentioned in their employment contract or company policy. Employers cannot ask employees to find a replacement if they use their paid time off. Unused PTO Payment No law mandating employers in Nevada to pay unused PTO on termination unless it is explicitly included in company policies. However, accrued PTO must be reinstated if an employee rejoins the company within 90 days of being terminated. How can Truein help with paid time off management?

Pennsylvania overtime law is one of the crucial regulations employers must incorporate in their compliance policies. This article explores the state and federal regulations that Pennsylvania employers must know. Adherence to these regulations is essential not only to comply with the law but also to uphold ethical standards and maintain a positive work environment. This guide will help you better understand and implement Pennsylvania’s overtime laws. Table of Contents Tipped Worker Rules and Tip Pooling Clarification on ownership of tips and gratuities paid via non-cash methods Prohibition of employers deducting processing fees from employee tips Guidelines for forming tip pools Understanding Definitions and Requirements for Tipped Employees Comprehending Federal Overtime Regulations: Ensuring Worker Protection and Compliance Insight into Federal Overtime Regulations Guidance on Compliance in Case of Conflicts Overview of Pennsylvania Overtime Laws Eligibility Criteria Calculation for Overtime in Pennsylvania Exemptions: Special Rules for Tipped Employees and Alternate Work Schedules Alternate Work Schedules (AWS) Clarifications on Exemptions and Daily Overtime Limits How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion Tipped Worker Rules and Tip Pooling Pennsylvania has many establishments in the service industry that employ many tipped workers—Pennsylvania’s regulations regarding tipped workers and tip pooling aim to protect the earnings of tipped employees. Clarification on ownership of tips and gratuities paid via non-cash methods As per law, in Pennsylvania, the tips and gratuities belong to the employees who receive them, regardless of whether they are paid through cash or non-cash, such as credit card payments. Therefore, tips given by customers are the property of the tipped employees, and employers are prohibited from withholding or retaining any portion of these tips for themselves. Prohibition of employers deducting processing fees from employee tips The Department of Labor clearly states that no employer can deduct any sort of processing fee from employee tips for credit cards or another mode of payment . Under no condition can an employer deduct any processing fee, ensuring that all employees receive total compensation and all tips. Guidelines for forming tip pools A tip pool can include all employees who receive the minimum wage of $7.25 per state and federal rules. However, tip pools can only have individuals who receive regular tips. It can include non-tipped employees if they also receive the state-determined minimum wage. Managers, supervisors, or employers are strictly prohibited from receiving tips from the tip pools. However, these individuals can contribute to the tip tools. These employees can receive tips from the patrons if they provide the entire service without assistance. Understanding Definitions and Requirements for Tipped Employees Tipped employees are the ones who receive regular tips in addition to hourly wages. To be considered a tipped employee, an individual must earn at least $135 monthly tips. As per the regulations, employers must ensure that tipped employees earn at least $7.25 per hour, including the base hourly wage and tips. If a tip-credited employee earns less than $7.25 per hour, the employer must make the difference to comply with the Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act. Comprehending Federal Overtime Regulations: Ensuring Worker Protection and Compliance Understanding federal overtime regulations is crucial for employers to ensure compliance and protect the rights of their workers. Act 70, effective July 9, 2021 , is one of the most essential overtime regulations. Insight into Federal Overtime Regulations The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) governs federal overtime regulations in all states in the United States. Pennsylvania doesn’t have any state law for overtime, so it implements FLSA as per the overtime rules for all employers. Under overtime regulations as per the FLSA, all non-exempt employees are entitled to receive overtime pay at least 1.5 times their regular pay rate for all hours worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek. Irrespective of the industry, employers must provide all non-exempt employees overtime pay and accurate compensation. There are guidelines for determining employee eligibility for overtime pay, including classifications as exempt or non-exempt and specific criteria for exemption status. Employers must familiarize themselves with the provisions of Act 70 to ensure compliance with the latest federal overtime regulations. Guidance on Compliance in Case of Conflicts If there is a conflict between the state and federal laws regarding overtime, employers are advised to follow the regulation that provides maximum protection to workers. For instance, if there is a conflict in deciding the appropriate overtime pay rates for your employees due to a conflict of the laws, choose the federal or state law depending on which provides higher overtime pay rates or broader eligibility criteria. However, employers must seek legal counsel for clarification on the appropriate course of action. Employers can ensure maximum worker protection by prioritizing compliance with state and federal regulations. Overview of Pennsylvania Overtime Laws Pennsylvania’s overtime law aligns with federal law, allowing all non-exempt employees to earn overtime at 1.5 times the regular wage rate. Such employees are eligible for overtime beyond a 40-hour workweek. For employers, it is essential to understand the eligibility, rate, and other criteria for overtime payment. Eligibility Criteria All employers in Pennsylvania are required to pay most hourly employees overtime. Salaried employees are primarily exempt, but a few categories of salaried employees can be eligible for overtime pay as per state and federal law. Additionally, the eligibility for overtime pay is determined based on the number of hours worked in a workweek. Employees are entitled to overtime pay at one and a half times their regular pay rate for hours worked beyond 40. Calculation for Overtime in Pennsylvania For hourly employees: Hourly employees should be paid time and a half for hours over 40 work hours/week. Hourly employees receiving bonus or commission: Overtime calculation for such employees is made based on this formula= {((Total hours x Hourly Rate) + Commission) / Total hours} / 2 For salaried employees: For eligible salaried employees, the overtime pay is made per regulation, i.e., 1.5 times the regular page for the overtime hours. Exemptions: Certain salaried employees are exempted from overtime requirements under Pennsylvania law. According to Pennsylvania’s overtime law, here is a complete list of those exempt from overtime requirements . Some of the exempted employees include: Specially skilled employees like computer workers Agricultural workers Seasonal employees Executives Administrative Professional employees making at least $684 per week Highly compensated employees However, these exemptions are narrowly construed; you must check the specific criteria outlined in state and federal regulations to qualify for exemption status. The above rules and exemptions are a mixture of the overtime laws determined by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and federal laws. Employers in the state can provide more benefits and rights contained in the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, but not less. Special Rules for Tipped Employees and Alternate Work Schedules According to Pennsylvania overtime laws, a tipped employee has to earn tips of $135 per month to be exempted from overtime. They are eligible for the tip credit if they earn less than this. Therefore, if you employ tipped employees, you must check if they receive a significant portion of their income from gratuities. Then, you can make changes to the employment policies as necessary. Also, the 80/20 rule applies to tipped employees. The rule stipulates that tipped employees must spend at least 80% of their time performing tipped duties directly related to customer service. They can pay 20% of the time on non-tipped duties, such as side work or cleaning. Non-customer tasks must be at most 20% of the employee’s total work time to be eligible for tipped employee benefits. Alternate Work Schedules (AWS) An alternate work schedule is also known as a flexible or compressed work schedule. It is entirely up to the employees’ discretion to provide AWS to employees. Eligibility for AWS typically depends on employer policies and agreements negotiated with employees or labor unions. Under a compressed work schedule, employees can complete the 80-hour work in less than ten work days. Flexible work schedules allow employees to deviate from a specified arrival and departure time but must be present for core work. AWS may allow for longer shifts without triggering overtime pay until a certain threshold of hours worked in a workweek is met. Clarifications on Exemptions and Daily Overtime Limits As mentioned, certain occupations are exempt from overtime pay requirements under state and federal law. It mainly includes certain types of salaried employees, professionals, and certain seasonal workers. For employers, it is mandatory to review exemption criteria carefully to ensure compliance with regulations. Unlike some states, Pennsylvania does not impose daily overtime limits. Instead, overtime pay is typically calculated based on hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. This means that employers can independently decide the overtime hours for the employees. However, it is recommended that employers maintain a balanced schedule for employee overtime. How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management?

These laws govern the allocation, accrual, and usage of paid time off for employees, encompassing vacation, sick, and other types of leave. Employers must comply with the various PTO laws in their policies to ensure fair treatment of employees, maintain productivity, and avoid legal liabilities. Effective management of PTO benefits both employers and employees, which is why employers must meet their legal obligations. This comprehensive guide on New Mexico PTO law provides employers with details of various laws, emphasizing the importance of compliance. Table of Contents Vacation Leave Quota Accruals Rollover of accrued PTO Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay New Mexico Laws on Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination New Mexico Sick Leave Policy New Mexico Paid Sick Law Maternity, Paternity and FMLA Leave Provisions Bereavement Leave Jury Duty Leave Military Leave Voting Leave New Mexico State Holidays in 2024 How can Truein help with paid time off management? Conclusion Vacation Leave Quota As of 2024, New Mexico PTO law doesn’t mandate private employers to offer vacation leave to employees. The state does not require any vacation leave quota, leaving it to employers to define their policies, so the decision is at their discretion. However, if an employer offers paid or unpaid vacation leave, the policies should be communicated and consistently applied to all employees. Employees must be informed about policies governing the accrual, usage, and payment of accrued leave upon termination. Accruals PTO accruals refer to the accumulation of paid time off based on an employee’s length of service and hours worked. In New Mexico, PTO accruals are not mandatory, but still, most employers allow employees to accrue PTO, typically based on factors such as years of service or hours worked. The employer must permit accrual per pay period, monthly, or yearly. Employers also have the freedom to cap vacation accrual. Employers must communicate the accrual method and rates to employees and ensure accurate tracking of accrued PTO to prevent misunderstandings or disputes. Rollover of accrued PTO New Mexico is one of the states allowing a use-it-or-lose-it policy. Employers can prevent employees from carrying over accrued PTO to the following year. In the absence of any rollover provision in New Mexico PTO law, the policies regarding the rollover or carryover of accrued but unused PTO from one year to the next, if allowed, depend on employer policies. Employers may implement rollover provisions to incentivize employees to use their accrued PTO responsibly while accommodating fluctuations in staffing needs throughout the year. Statutory provisions addressing vacation pay The state has no statutory provisions as accrued vacation time is not treated as wages. New Mexico PTO law does not mandate employers to offer accrued vacation time or pay for unused PTO within a specified timeframe after an employee’s termination. New Mexico Laws on Payment of Accrued, Unused Vacation on Termination Payment of accrued, unused vacation time on termination is not mandatory. As the state doesn’t require employers to offer paid or unpaid vacation time, there is no provision to make employers pay for unused PTO upon termination. However, if an employer in New Mexico has a policy allowing employees to accrue vacation time, unused vacation time is considered wages. In such a scenario, New Mexico PTO law requires employers to pay employees for accrued, unused vacation time upon termination. New Mexico Sick Leave Policy New Mexico follows the federal guidelines for sick leave. Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), all eligible employees must be allowed 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. The eligible employees are the individuals who: Employed with the current employer for at least 12 months or worked 1,250 hours in the previous year Works at a location with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius Employees can use unpaid sick leave to attend to a family member’s personal or medical needs due to injury, mental illness, maternity, or paternity requirements. FMLA sick leave is unpaid. New Mexico Paid Sick Law The New Mexico Paid Sick Leave Law, which took effect on July 1, 2022, mandates that employers should provide paid sick leave to all employees (part-time, seasonal, and temporary ones) for their own or a family member’s illness, medical appointments, or other covered reasons. Employers must ensure compliance with the accrual rate of 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Employees can also carry over unused paid sick leave to the following year. However, employers can cap paid sick time to 64 hours annually. Furthermore, it is not mandatory to pay unused or paid sick leave on termination. By offering paid sick leave, employers can demonstrate their commitment to employee wellness and mitigate the spread of illness in the workplace. In Bernalillo County, New Mexico, all employers with more than two employees should allow employees to accrue 1 hour of paid leave for every 32 hours worked. This leave can be up to 56 hours in 3 years and used for any purpose. Maternity, Paternity and FMLA Leave Provisions In New Mexico, while there are no state-specific laws for paid maternity or paternity leave, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) applies. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with job-protected leave for birth and care of a newborn child and adoption or foster care placement. It allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for maternal or paternal requirements. In addition to FMLA, New Mexico also follows the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) to protect the rights of pregnant women. As per the act, employers cannot discriminate against pregnant employees or make decisions about their hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, etc. In addition to the federal laws, New Mexico also has the New Mexico Human Rights Act mandating all employers with four or more employees to treat pregnancy as any other medical condition, and there should be no discrimination due to pregnancy, childbirth, or other pregnancy-related medical conditions. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave in New Mexico is not mandated by state law and depends on the employer’s discretion. However, most employers offer bereavement leave when an employee experiences the death of a family member. Typically, the leave offered is two days and is unpaid. The policies regarding bereavement leave, such as duration and eligibility, depend on the employers’ policies and should be outlined in the employee handbook or employment contracts. Employers who offer bereavement leave often see it as a way to provide support and compassion to their employees during difficult times. Jury Duty Leave All employers must offer unpaid jury duty leave, providing employees the necessary time off to fulfill their civic obligations as jurors. Employees should be allowed to serve on a jury without fear of retaliation or adverse employment actions from employers. Employers cannot penalize or discriminate against employees for serving on jury duty or make them use sick leave, vacation time, or other accrued PTO for jury duty. This leave must be provided to full-time and part-time employees, regardless of their length of service or tenure with the employer. Employers are not required to pay employees for time spent on jury duty. However, employees serving on the jury are paid $7.50 a day as juror pay. Military Leave As part of New Mexico PTO law, military leave is a crucial aspect of employment law that provides protections and benefits for employees who serve in the armed forces or National Guard. Employers should be aware of their obligations regarding military leave to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations while supporting employees in their military service requirements. New Mexico implements the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which provides additional protections for military service members, including: 1. Job reinstatement rights upon return from military leave. 2. Continuation of health benefits during military service. 3. Protection against discrimination or retaliation based on military service. As per USERRA, leave for active military service can be up to 5 years without pay. In addition, they should be provided 24 months of health care coverage while on leave. New Mexico State Law New Mexico also has state laws protecting military personnel from retaliation from employers to serve in the military. It applied to all service members from the National Guard, the US Armed Forces, and other reserved services. The law requires that all such employees be reinstated within 90 days of leaving their active duty or recovery from injury. Voting Leave New Mexico’s employment laws mandate that employers provide employees up to 2 hours of paid time off for voting. However, this leave is optional for employees whose work time starts after 2 hours of voting time or ends 3 hours before voting ends. Voting leave in New Mexico allows employees to exercise their democratic rights without fear of reprisal or loss of pay. Employers cannot request proof of voting or require advance notification for voting time off. New Mexico State Holidays in 2024 New Mexico observes various state holidays throughout the year. However, private employers are not required to provide paid or unpaid holidays to employees. Public employees are provided with 11 state holidays. Here is the complete list of holidays observed in New Mexico in 2024: Holiday Observed in 2024 General Date New Year’s Day 2024 Monday, January 1 January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Monday, January 15 3rd Monday in January Memorial Day Monday, May 27 Last Monday in May Juneteenth Wednesday, June 19 June 19 Independence Day Thursday, July 4 July 4 Labor Day Monday, September 2 1st Monday in September Indigenous Peoples’ Day Monday, October 14 2nd Monday in October Veterans Day Monday, November 11 November 11 Thanksgiving Day Thursday, November 28 4th Thursday of November Presidents’ Day (Observed) (*) Friday, November 29 Day after Thanksgiving Christmas Day Wednesday, Dec. 25 December 25 How can Truein help with paid time off management?

Business owners must ensure their company policies align with state and federal laws. If your business is in Utah, you must comply with Utah overtime law and Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regulations. Here, we help employers grasp the importance of comprehending these laws by providing an overview of the state’s overtime law, including exemptions, minimum wage rules, myths, leaves, and more. Table of Contents Federal and Utah Overtime Laws Common Misconceptions About Overtime Exemptions Frequently Asked Questions on Utah Overtime Law Understanding Utah Minimum Wage Law Frequently Asked Questions on Utah Minimum Wage Law Overtime Eligibility and Calculation Methods Overtime Calculation Methods Exemptions from FLSA Wages, Breaks, and Final Paychecks Leave Requirements and Hiring/Firing Practices Record-keeping, Background Checks, and Social Media Laws COBRA and Health Insurance Continuation How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion Federal and Utah Overtime Laws Utah has no distinct overtime laws, and the state follows the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines. Under the FLSA, all employers must provide employees overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular rate for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. For employers, it is easier to comply with the Utah overtime law as it extends the FLSA, which forms the basis of overtime compensation and is a critical aspect of labor rights. However, a common area of misunderstanding lies in overtime exemptions. A common belief among employers is that salaried employees are automatically exempt from Utah’s overtime law. However, it needs to be clarified for the rule. Determining an employee’s exemption status hinges not on their job title or payment method but their specific duties. As an employer, you must recognize that job titles alone do not exempt employees from overtime pay; instead, it’s the nature of their duties and responsibilities that play a decisive role. For instance, under the FLSA guidelines, salaried employees performing administrative, executive, and professional responsibilities may qualify for exemptions if they meet specific criteria, such as salary earning less than minimum wage. Understanding such requirements and exemption criteria for employers in Utah remains crucial to ensure they comply with federal and state labor laws. Common Misconceptions About Overtime Exemptions Salaried e mployees are automatically exempt from overtime: No state or federal regulation exempts all salaried employees from overtime by default. The exemption depends on the salary level and the nature of the work performed, not whether employees are paid hourly or by salary. Small businesses are exempt from FLSA requirements: The FLSA overtime regulations apply broadly, and most businesses must comply with overtime provisions regardless of size. Overtime is based on a daily, rather than weekly, threshold: Under federal law, overtime is calculated every week — over 40 hours per week, not 8 hours per day. Highly compensated, white-collar, and manager, supervisor, or administrator roles are exempted : Again, it’s still being determined. Such employees are most likely to be exempted, but this alone is not the determining factor; it also depends on several other factors. Management employees can also qualify for overtime if their primary job duties do not align with the FLSA’s exemption criteria. Frequently Asked Questions on Utah Overtime Law What businesses are covered under the FLSA in Utah? In Utah, as in other states, the FLSA covers most businesses with at least two employees and an annual turnover of at least $500,000. Additionally, all healthcare establishments, such as hospitals providing residential care services, schools, preschools, and government agents, must adhere to FLSA guidelines. Do I need to pay independent contractors overtime? The FLSA states that independent contractors are not covered under its overtime regulations. However, the misclassification of employees as independent contractors to save overtime spending violates Utah’s overtime law. What are the consequences of misclassifying employees as independent contractors? Misclassification can lead to legal and financial penalties under the state and federal labor laws. Employers must classify workers to ensure appropriate overtime pay and benefits. A violation can result in back pay claims, tax liabilities, and penalties. Are salaried employees exempt from overtime pay? Mode of compensation is not the determining factor in deciding overtime pay eligibility. While some salaried employees are exempt, it depends on their job duties and salary level. Salaried employees earning below a certain threshold or whose primary duties do not meet exemption criteria must receive overtime pay. Understanding Utah Minimum Wage Law Utah adheres to the federal minimum wage outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). As of 2024, the minimum wage in Utah is $7.25 per hour. While the minimum wage can be lower for tipped workers, it has underlying requirements that ensure that all employees earn at least this much. In Utah, if an employee’s tips combined with the employer’s direct wages do not equal the minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference. Additionally, employees under 20 during their first 90 consecutive calendar days of employment can be paid below minimum wage, at least $4.25 per hour. Frequently Asked Questions on Utah Minimum Wage Law Can employers in Utah take a ‘tip credit’ against their minimum wage obligations? Yes, Utah employers can use a tip credit, allowing them to pay lower than minimum wage to tipped employees. This means employers can pay a reduced hourly wage for employees who earn at least $30 in monthly tips. Furthermore, the employer must cover the shortfall if the tips and wages don’t meet the minimum wage. How does tip pooling work in Utah? Tip pooling is legal in Utah, but there are rules. All tips pooled must be distributed among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips, such as waiters, bartenders, bellhops, and bussers. Management and owners cannot be part of the pool or hold any portion of the tips. Can I keep some tips for you as an employer? Employers are not allowed to keep tips received by their employees. However, if the employer has a valid tip pooling arrangement, they can require employees to contribute some tips. How do tip credits affect overtime calculations? The employee’s regular pay rate should include hourly wages and tip credits when calculating overtime. Therefore, overtime pay must be 1.5 times this combined rate for hours worked over 40 a week. Overtime Eligibility and Calculation Methods The eligibility for overtime pay is clearly defined in the Utah Code § 34-30-8 . It states: “Any persons, corporation, firm, contractor, agent, manager, or foreman, who shall require or contract with any person to work upon such works or undertakings longer than 40 hours in one week shall pay such employees at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.” It aligns with the federal FLSA overtime provision and is equally applied to full-time and part-time employees. Overtime Calculation Methods However, only some employees are paid overtime at the same rate, depending on their job responsibilities and type of employment. Here’s a breakdown of each overtime calculation method. Hourly Rates: The most straightforward overtime calculation is for hourly employees, who are paid at 1.5 times the regular hourly rate. Bonuses or Commissions: An employee who earns a bonus or commission must be included in the regular rate calculation for overtime purposes. For overtime calculation for such employees, this formula is used: {((Total hours x Hourly Rate) + Commission) / Total hours} / 2 Salaried: For salaried non-exempt employees in Utah, the regular rate is calculated by dividing the weekly salary by the number of hours the salary is intended to cover. Overtime is paid in addition to this salary for hours worked beyond 40 a week. Exemptions from FLSA The following classes of employees are not entitled to overtime pay in Utah: Minors under 16 Executive employees Administrative employees Computer workers Professional employees earning at least $684 per week Independent contractors Outside salespeople Seasonal workers Live-in employees such as housekeepers Wages, Breaks, and Final Paychecks Utah has no provision requiring employers to provide breaks to employees. Still, allowing employees to take breaks is a standard practice to keep productivity high. Employers who offer breaks of less than 20 minutes must compensate for these as regular work time. Breaks of 30 minutes or more can be unpaid, provided the employee is completely relieved from duty. Utah labor law requires employers to issue final paychecks to terminated employees within 24 hours. If the employee quits or resigns, the final paycheck may be issued on the next regular payday. Special Considerations for Minors For employees under 16, employers must provide a meal break of at least 30 minutes on shifts exceeding five consecutive hours. Additionally, minors must be given 10 minutes break every 4 hours. Leave Requirements and Hiring/Firing Practices Utah does not require employees to provide paid sick leave to employees. The same goes for bereavement, vacation, and holiday leaves. Employers have complete discretion in deciding policies for these leaves. However, there are some mandatory leaves which include: Unpaid medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). All eligible employees in Utah must be given up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for specific family and medical reasons, with continuation of group health insurance coverage. Utah also mandates that employers provide leave for jury duty, witness appearance in court, and court leave for parents, guardians, or legal custodians of a minor appearing in court. Utah’s voting leave rule requires employees to provide 2 hours of paid time off to vote. Hiring Practices : Utah follows the “employment-at-will” doctrine, meaning either the employer or the employee can end the employment relationship at any time, for any reason. Employers in Utah must adhere to fair hiring practices, ensuring non-discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information. Firing Practices : While employers in Utah can generally terminate employment at will, they must avoid discriminatory practices and adhere to any contractual obligations or company policies they have established. Employers should also be aware of and comply with the WARN Act if they conduct large-scale layoffs or close a facility. It requires employers to inform affected employees 60 days before closing a plant or layoffs. Record-keeping, Background Checks, and Social Media Laws Under Utah labor laws, employers must maintain accurate records of employees for at least three years. This includes personal information and data concerning hours worked, wages, and other conditions of employment. Employers in Utah may conduct background checks on prospective employees. Still, they must comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) , which ensures the privacy and accuracy of information in background checks. As far as social media goes, employers in Utah cannot ask employees to: Disclose their usernames or passwords Take action for not providing username or passwords However, there is an exemption if employers have specific information about an employee’s activity violating any federal or state law or work-related misconduct. COBRA and Health Insurance Continuation The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) allows employees to continue their health insurance coverage after employment. The federal COBRA regulation only applies to employers with 20 or more employees. Utah has adopted a mini-COBRA provision that allows employees to continue their coverage for up to 12 months. Employers are required to inform their employees of their COBRA rights within 30 days of termination. How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management?

For small businesses, such disruptions can be too costly and pose significant threats to their existence. A business continuity plan (BCP) for small businesses is essential. A business continuity plan is a vital document that outlines the essential framework to enable businesses to maintain operations during disruptive events such as natural disasters, technological mishaps, and cyber attacks. Small businesses have different resources than large corporations to recover from setbacks resulting from such disruptions. An example is the COVID-19-induced lockdown, which resulted in the closing down of almost 53% of small businesses in the Mid-Atlantic region in the US . To avoid such an outcome, you must be prepared to manage crises effectively as a small business owner. A BCP can help you ensure you can quickly resume critical operations, minimizing downtime and financial losses. This article discusses creating a business continuity plan for long-term survival and success. Table of Contents Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Business Continuity Plan for Small Businesses Step 1: Conduct a Risk Assessment Step 2: Identify Critical Business Functions and Resources Step 3: Develop Emergency Response Procedures Step 4: Establish Communication Protocols Step 5: Implement Data Backup and Recovery Strategies Step 6: Test and Update the Plan Regularly Benefits of Business Continuity Planning for Small Businesses Business Continuity Plan Checklist for Small and Medium Businesses Pre-planning checklist steps Planning phase checklist steps Post-planning checklist steps Case study of small business continuity How Can An Attendance Tracking System Like Truein Help With Business Continuity Planning? Conclusion Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Business Continuity Plan for Small Businesses Step 1: Conduct a Risk Assessment You can only create a successful business continuity plan if you are aware of the pitfalls in your small business operation. That’s why BCP starts with a comprehensive risk assessment. This process involves meticulously evaluating potential threats that could disrupt business operations. Risk assessment is the first step in identifying the bottlenecks and loopholes that could impact your business. The underlying risks vary widely depending on the nature of the industry and location. First, you should list the most likely scenarios that can affect business operations, such as natural disasters like floods or earthquakes, technological issues like system failures, or even market-driven challenges like sudden shifts in consumer demand. Small businesses must delve into internal and external threats, unlike big corporations. Internal risks include factors like a key employee leaving the company or a conflict within the management, while external threats can range from economic downturns to regulatory changes. You can use tools like SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to identify internal and external factors affecting your business. Step 2: Identify Critical Business Functions and Resources Once risks are identified, you can recognize the functions and resources essential for small business continuity. It will require scrutinizing every aspect of your business operations to determine which functions are vital. For small businesses, this can be tricky. There are often interdependencies between different functions. For instance, your business’ sales process might be critical, but so is the IT support that enables it. After identifying the critical functions, you should focus on the resources that are required to support these functions. Generally, essential resources for small businesses include staff, technology, infrastructure, and external partners like suppliers and distributors. Prioritize functions and resources by asking questions such as: Which employees are essential to keep your operations running? What technology is non-negotiable for day-to-day activities? Step 3: Develop Emergency Response Procedures The whole point of a small business recovery plan is to ensure that it can respond immediately in emergencies. A set of emergency response procedures is essential for such preparedness. It not only helps in minimizing damage during an incident but also expedites the recovery process. Developing emergency response procedures as part of a small business continuity plan involves outlining the procedures for each type of emergency identified in your risk assessment. These procedures should be as detailed as possible. For instance, outline the steps to secure your networks and inform affected parties in case of a data breach. Additionally, clear communication is vital during emergencies. A communication plan should be in place outlining in case of a business disruption who will communicate what information, to whom, and through which channels. Step 4: Establish Communication Protocols As part of the business continuity for small businesses, establishing robust communication protocols ensures that all stakeholders – employees, customers, suppliers, and the wider community – receive timely and accurate information about the situation and the business’s response. Nothing can be more disruptive in the after-effect of a disaster than confused stakeholders. You have to ensure that information is effectively relayed across effectively. Small businesses can use email, messaging apps, or an intranet for internal communication with employees. Consider using social media, your business website, and traditional media channels for external communication, if appropriate. Your goal is to ensure that misinformation is not spreading during a crisis. Without communication protocols, information can be delayed, exacerbating a problematic situation. Designate a spokesperson or a communication team responsible for drafting and disseminating information. Ensure all communication is clear, accurate, and consistent across all channels. Step 5: Implement Data Backup and Recovery Strategies Digitization has become integral for small businesses to operate efficiently. Data is a pivotal asset for any business, and protecting this data becomes a cornerstone of business continuity planning. Having a plan to backup data and recover it promptly ensures that your small business can quickly regain access to essential information following a disruption, be it a cyberattack, a natural disaster, or a technical failure. Depending on the requirements and size of your business, the amount of data produced will vary. Pick a data backup strategy that might work best for you, including regular on-site backups, off-site backups, and possibly cloud-based solutions. However, data backup frequency should align with the rate at which your data changes. The next step is establishing a recovery strategy to restore operations swiftly in case of a disaster. Also, the recovery process should be regularly tested to ensure it works when needed. Step 6: Test and Update the Plan Regularly A small business continuity plan is not static and should be regularly tested and refined. There is no point in creating a BCP that only exists on paper. With regular testing, you can ensure it is also practical and effective in real-world scenarios. One business continuity plan example for small businesses for testing is simulation or drill. Examples include drills testing evacuation routes, emergency communication channels, or tabletop exercises, where team members discuss their roles and responses to hypothetical scenarios. A feedback routine must follow up on every test to gather participants’ responses and identify areas for improvement. This is essential for refining the plan to make it more effective. It’s important to document these changes and ensure that all stakeholders are aware of any updates. Benefits of Business Continuity Planning for Small Businesses Risk Identification and Mitigation A robust small business continuity plan can effectively identify underlying risks and mitigate their effects. As a small business owner, you are more vulnerable to disruptions, so a well-documented BCP can anticipate potential threats and outline strategies to minimize their impact. Peace of Mind Without uncertainty over your business operations during emergencies, you have peace of mind. Your employees and customers can also be saved from anxiety when they know the business has predefined steps to handle unexpected situations. Minimized Downtime Downtime can be dangerous to the existence of small businesses. Continuity planning ensures minimal disruptions, and a recovery strategy is in place to swiftly resume operations, thereby limiting financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. Employee Morale and Decision-Making A well-communicated business continuity plan empowers your employees and facilitates decision-making. BCPs clarify their roles and responsibilities during crises, which gives them a sense of preparedness and confidence. This boosts their morale and leads to better decision-making under pressure. Protecting Company Reputation Crises and disruptions are not suitable for your business reputation. A business continuity plan for a small business involves establishing communication protocols to respond swiftly and competently to stakeholders. This can significantly protect and even enhance a company’s reputation. Customers tend to trust businesses that are committed to reliability and service continuity Competitive Edge Small businesses with resilience and reliability in business continuity have a competitive edge. Businesses that demonstrate an ability to manage crises effectively establish themselves as reliable players in their industry. Improved Business Continuity Agility can be improved with regularly tested and updated business continuity plans for small businesses. It prepares firms to adapt to new challenges, whether technological advancements, market changes, or emerging risks. Compliance with Regulations For several industries, such as health and finance, having a documented business continuity plan is not just good practice but a regulatory requirement. Small businesses in these sectors must demonstrate their ability to continue operations in customer interests. Demonstrating adherence to these regulations can avoid potential fines and legal issues while also building trust with regulatory bodies and customers. Potential Insurance Cost Savings The ultimate goal of a business continuity plan is to ensure minimal incidents, which ensures there are less severe impacts from disruptions. As a result, there are fewer insurance claims and potentially lower insurance premiums. Customer Satisfaction You continue to serve customers with minimal disruptions, even in adverse situations, which leads to high customer satisfaction and loyalty. Employee Relations Similarly, clear communication and involvement in continuity planning improve employee relations by demonstrating a commitment to their well-being and career security. Business Continuity Plan Checklist for Small and Medium Businesses Whether you are a small or medium business owner, it is essential to implement a business continuity plan. As there are too many factors to consider while creating a BCP, a checklist can help you manage it effectively. We divided the business continuity plan checklist into three sections: Pre-planning, planning, and post-planning. Pre-planning checklist steps Program Initiation and Management Begin by acknowledging the need for a business continuity plan to commit to the planning process. Start by drafting an outline for the plan and assigning roles and responsibilities to key personnel to oversee the continuity planning. Risk Evaluation and Control This is the step to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of the business to identify potential threats. It also involves developing strategies to mitigate identified risks to reduce their potential impact on business operations. Business Impact Analysis Evaluation of the possible impact of disruptions on the business operations and finances. At this step, you identify and prioritize critical business functions that must be sustained during a crisis. Planning phase checklist steps Developing Business Continuity Strategies Create specific strategies for your business to maintain or quickly resume critical operations during crises, depending on your business type and industry. This will require allocating the necessary resources for implementing the BCP strategies. Emergency Preparedness and Response Develop and document emergency response procedures for various crisis scenarios by ensuring all necessary emergency supplies and equipment are available and in working order. Developing and Implementing Business Plans Develop detailed business continuity plans based on the identified risks and start implementing the plans within your organization. Ensure all stakeholders know and understand their roles in the BCP implementation cycle. Post-planning checklist steps Awareness and Training Programs Continue testing BCP and training employees so they know their roles within the business continuity plans and provide feedback for improvements. Keep staff updated on any changes or updates to the continuity plans. Business Continuity Plan Exercise, Audit, and Maintenance Regular exercises and drills should be conducted to test the effectiveness of the business continuity plan. Audit the plans for their effectiveness against emerging threats and based on test results. Crisis Communications Establish communication protocols to ensure all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and stakeholders, receive timely and accurate information during emergencies. Coordination with External Agencies Establish relationships and coordination mechanisms with external agencies, such as local emergency services, suppliers, and partner organizations. There should be plans to include these external agencies within the BCP during a crisis. Case study of small business continuity Cantey Technology, an IT infrastructure provider for over 200 global clients, faced disruption when 2013 lightning struck one of their facilities in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. The fire caused severe harm to Cantey’s network infrastructure. The hosting servers were destroyed beyond repair, but their clients never noticed any service outage. How? Cantey, as part of its business continuity plan, has already emphasized regular backups of their data to remote servers. This business continuity plan example for small businesses demonstrates that effective BCP can save your company and clients from dissemination. How Can An Attendance Tracking System Like Truein Help With Business Continuity Planning? Businesses of all sizes can benefit from attendance monitoring tools like Truein for business continuity planning. Truein is a cloud-based, hardware-less time and attendance tracking system that can be deployed in-house and in remote locations. Truein has GPS geofencing technology that can track the location of the workers across multiple sites. Managers have a real-time view of staff across various locations, making it particularly useful for businesses with multiple sites, like retail chains. In the event of a temporary closure at one site (due to a natural disaster), managers can quickly assess staff availability and reallocate personnel to other locations. Real-time monitoring of attendance and scheduling also makes Truein a potential tool for BCP, as managers can swiftly change shifts to overcome any production disruptions in events like machinery breakdown in a manufacturing plant. Instead of halting production, management can immediately reassign staff to different tasks or locations or schedule maintenance without significant disruptions to the production schedule.

Employers must be aware of these laws for legal compliance, managing labor costs, and maintaining employee relations. The Alabama overtime laws and regulations are set within state and federal guidelines. As an employer, you must be aware of these laws and implement them within your H.R. policies. To help employers comply, we created this comprehensive guide overviewing Alabama overtime laws.

Do meal and break periods count as work time for overtime calculations? How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion Understanding Alabama Overtime Laws Definition of overtime according to Alabama law In Alabama, as of 2024, any hours worked over 40 in a single workweek are considered overtime as per law. It is in tandem with federal law and consistently implements the Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA) definition. Alabama has no state law definition for overtime; however, unlike most states, Alabama doesn’t require daily overtime pay for hours worked over a standard eight-hour workday. This means that if the total work hours do not exceed the 40-hour weekly threshold, even if workers work over 8 hours a day, they do not need to be paid overtime. Which employees are entitled to overtime pay? The majority of hourly employees in Alabama are entitled to overtime pay. It includes all hourly, tipped, and certain salaried employees. The state follows the FSLA laws on the overtime eligibility criteria, ensuring that full-time and part-time workers receive compensation for overtime hours irrespective of industry type. However, under Alabama law, certain employees, such as independent contractors and volunteers, are generally not eligible for overtime pay. Exemptions: Categories of employees exempt from overtime As of 2024, Alabama overtime laws recognize all exemptions described within the FSLA framework. Under these regulations, specific categories of employees are exempted from overtime pay requirements. It typically applies to salaried employees who meet specific criteria related to their job duties, responsibilities, and salary levels. Here are the employees commonly exempted from overtime in Alabama, including executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and certain computer-related occupations. Any employee who is highly compensated, earning over $107,432 per year Employees responsible for managing at least one other employee, such as administrators and executives Employees working in creative professions and sales Salaried computer employees earning at least $684 per week Outside sales employees All other salaried employees working in positions requiring specialized skills and knowledge For employers, it is essential to be aware of these exemptions and accurately categorize employees to avoid potential legal issues. Calculation of overtime pay rates The overtime pay rates in Alabama are the same as the federal rates, which are 1.5 times the regular wage rate. For every hour worked over 40 per week, employees should be paid one and a half times the regular pay rate. For instance, if an employee’s regular hourly rate is $15, their overtime rate would be $22.50 (1.5 x $15) per hour. This is a simple calculation for salaried employees. However, overtime calculation for commission employees in Alabama is different. The overtime rate for commission-receiving employees is calculated as follows: (Total hours x hourly rate + commission) / total hours worked in the workweek Then, they are paid half of this regular rate for each overtime hour. Let’s understand this with an example. An employee works for 50 hours a week at minimum wage, that’s $7.25 per hour and receives $50 as commission for the week. Their overtime rate will be calculated as follows: 50 x 7.25 + 50 / 50 = 8.25 But they will be paid half of this rate for overtime, which is 8.25/2 = $4.12 per hour. So their total pay will be : 40 x $7.25 + 10 x $4.12 = $ 331.30 Employers must ensure that overtime calculations are based on the actual hours worked and that the pay rate accurately reflects the employee’s regular earnings. Key Provisions of Alabama Overtime Laws Overtime pay rate: Calculation and requirements Overtime pay rates in Alabama are, by federal law, one and a half times the regular pay rate with exemptions. Salaried and tipped employees receive overtime at this rate; however, employers can use the “tip credit” system for tipped employees. It allows employers to pay tipped employees lower than the minimum wage rate. However, employers cannot include the tipped credit in the overtime pay calculation, and the final compensation should not be lower than the minimum wage rate, including tips. For commission-based employees, the overtime rate is as mentioned above, which considers their commission earnings, too. All eligible employees are entitled to receive one and a half times their regular hourly rate for overtime hours, whether full-time or part-time. Hours worked: What constitutes “work” for overtime purposes? As per the FLSA section 29 C.F.R. Part 785 , all time an employee is required to be on the employer’s premises, on duty, or at a prescribed workplace is counted as working time. However, additional conditions such as travel time, on-call time, and training time can also be included in the overtime depending on the scenario and need to be discussed with the legal team. However, employers should include break periods of less than 30 minutes at work. Additionally, any time spent in preparation before the actual start of the main work activity is also considered work. Record-keeping requirements for employers As per the Alabama overtime laws in 2024, all employers in the state must keep accurate records of their employees. This includes their total hours worked each day and workweek, the regular hourly pay rate, total daily or weekly straight-time earnings, total overtime earnings for the workweek, deductions from or additions to wages, and total wages paid each pay period. As per the law, it is essential to maintain accurate records for employees for three years to comply with legal standards. It also serves employers as crucial documentation for disputes or inspections. Enforcement and penalties for violations Per the 2022 Code of Alabama Title 25 – Industrial Relations and Labor Chapter 8 , violating labor laws can lead to significant penalties. These penalties include back payment of wages owed, liquidated damages, fines, and, in severe cases, legal sanctions. The penalty can include a fine of $300, which can go up to a civil penalty of $5000 for certain violations. An employer who violates Act 2009-565 may be deemed guilty of a Class B or Class C misdemeanor. All employers must adhere to the Alabama overtime laws to avoid costly legal repercussions and to maintain a fair and compliant workplace environment. Common Misconceptions about Alabama Overtime Laws It is common for employers to be confused about various aspects of Alabama overtime laws. Let’s look at some of the common myths regarding these laws. Myth: All salaried employees are exempt from overtime pay Being paid a salary does not automatically exempt an employee from overtime. It entirely depends on an employee’s job duties and salary level and strictly follows the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines. Myth: If an employee agrees to it, you don’t have to pay overtime All eligible employees must be paid overtime, regardless of any agreement. Employers must comply with the overtime regulations irrespective of any informal or formal agreements with employees to waive overtime pay. Myth: Employees working overtime without permission qualify for overtime pay In Alabama, employees must have permission from their employers to work overtime shifts. Employees in all roles should have permission to be eligible to receive pay for overtime hours. Frequently Asked Questions Can I offer comp time instead of overtime pay? All private sector employers in Alabama must pay overtime rather than offer compensatory time off. The payment must be made in the next regular payroll period following the period in which the overtime was earned. Do meal and break periods count as work time for overtime calculations? It depends on the duration of the break. Short breaks, usually lasting about 5 to 20 minutes, are generally considered compensable work hours. Any break of 30 minutes or longer is not considered work time. How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Truein can be a significant aid in managing overtime pay in several ways.

Among essential compliance requirements is the New Hampshire overtime law, which mandates that all employees receive fair compensation for overtime. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the various laws and regulations regarding overtime in New Hampshire. The aim is to help employers ensure legal compliance and foster fair work practices that align with state and federal laws. Here, we are about to discuss the basics of overtime laws, minimum wage requirements, calculation for payment of wages, and and exemptions.

Conclusion New Hampshire Overtime Laws: Basics for Employers There is no particular New Hampshire overtime law, and the state follows the federal guidelines in deciding the regulations for overtime work. Following the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the state mandates that all employees receive overtime pay for hours over 40 in a workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times their regular pay rate. Employers in New Hampshire must review the FLSA guidelines on overtime pay and frame their policies to comply with the requirements. While employees must be paid for overtime hours, who is eligible for overtime and how it is calculated depends on different factors. Next, we will look at these requirements. Who is Entitled to Receive Overtime Pay as per New Hampshire Overtime Law Most hourly employees in New Hampshire are entitled to overtime pay. However, there are exemptions, such as certain administrative, executive, and professional employees, who may be exempt under specific criteria set by the FLSA. These employees are exempted based on their job description or earnings, which is predominantly according to the guidelines set by the FLSA . Generally, most hourly workers are non-exempt and entitled to overtime pay. That’s why employers need to classify employees to avoid legal issues correctly. Misclassification can lead to costly lawsuits and penalties. Salaried Employees May Be Eligible for Overtime Given the definitions of the overtime regulations as per FLSA, it is common for employers to classify all salaried employees as exempt from overtime. However, certain salaried employees are eligible for overtime. Employers must be aware that overtime eligibility is not solely determined by whether an employee is salaried or hourly but by the nature of their job responsibilities and salary level. For instance, a salaried employee earning less than a specified threshold (minimum $7.25 per hour) may still be eligible for overtime under the New Hampshire overtime law. This threshold is subject to periodic updates, so employers should monitor any changes in the law. Therefore, employers in the state must carefully assess the duties and compensation levels of their salaried employees to determine their overtime eligibility. Minimum Wage and Regular Payment of Wages In New Hampshire, as of 2024, employers must pay the minimum wage as determined by the federal standard, set at $7.25 per hour. This wage rate applies to most employees, with specific rules for tipped employees, who must receive a base wage of at least 45% of the standard minimum wage. Employers hiring tipped workers can pay a minimum wage of $3.27 per hour, provided their tipped employees regularly receive over $30 monthly in customer tips. The tips and the base wage must meet or exceed the standard minimum wage. You can refer to the New Hampshire Department of Labor site for complete details. Importance of Timely and Regular Payment of Wages to Employees New Hampshire law emphasizes the timely and regular payment of wages. Employers must ensure employees are paid within eight days of the week they perform the work. Additionally, in case of employment termination, compensation should be made within 72 hours if an employee is fired or quits with adequate notice or by the next regular payday if the employee quits without sufficient notice or is laid off. New Hampshire Department of Labor (NHDOL) mandates that employees are paid weekly and not less frequently than monthly under any condition. In case of a dispute over the amount of wages, employers are required to pay the undisputed part while leaving the employee free to pursue claims for the balance New Hampshire Overtime Law Summary Overview of relevant state and federal statutes New Hampshire’s overtime law is entirely based on the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) statutes, with only one exception. According to the FLSA, employees younger than 20 can be paid below the set minimum of $7.25 per hour. However, under the New Hampshire overtime law regulations, employees younger than 16. New Hampshire overtime rules The FLSA mandates that employees must be paid overtime at a rate of at least one and one-half times their regular rate for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. New Hampshire overtime law aligns with this federal mandate. Employers must ensure that their overtime policies align with the federal and local overtime laws. It’s also crucial to be aware that any updates in federal laws might necessitate changes in their payroll practices. When federal overtime rules apply Overtime eligibility in New Hampshire predominantly follows the guidelines set by the FLSA. As per federal law, non-exempt employees generally include hourly workers, both full-time and part-time employees. If you are not employing white-collar workers such as executive, administrative, or professional roles, you probably hire employees entitled to overtime pay. Ensure to refer to the FLSA guidelines to decide if an employee meets specific criteria related to their job duties and compensation to be exempted. Employers need to classify employees to avoid legal issues correctly. Misclassification can lead to costly lawsuits and penalties. Do not take the exemption of statutes as an indication that all salaried employees under the New Hampshire overtime law are exempted. The nature of the job and salary determines if a salaried employee is eligible for overtime. If the employee’s responsibility does not involve overlooking at least one employee, making management or administrative decisions, or specialized skills, then such an employee may be eligible for overtime. Additionally, any salaried employee earning less than that minimum wage, irrespective of their job description, will be eligible for overtime. Therefore, employers must carefully assess their salaried employees’ duties and compensation levels to determine their overtime eligibility. Exemptions from federal overtime laws While New Hampshire’s overtime laws largely mirror the FLSA, it is essential to recognize all state regulations, such as the age limit for minimum wage in New Hampshire being 16 and not 20, as set by the FLSA. Employers are responsible for understanding and implementing overtime laws for fair compensation. This requirement involves maintaining accurate records of hours worked and wages paid, correctly classifying employees, and ensuring that eligible employees receive the appropriate overtime compensation. Overtime Entitlement and Calculation Methods According to New Hampshire overtime laws, all non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay. It requires that employers should correctly classify employees for overtime calculation. The exempted employees include: Seasonal employees working for amusement or recreational establishments Administrative Staff Executives Outside sales workers Computer-related fields Jobs require specialized skills The overtime rates in New Hampshire are as per the FLSA, which is $7.25 per hour. However, employees can pay lower than minimum wage to tipped employees, provided they earn different monthly tips. Let’s take a look at overtime calculations for different employees. Overtime calculation for tipped employees in New Hampshire Tipped employees in New Hampshire customarily and regularly receive more than $30 per month in tips. As per the state law, such employees can be paid a base wage of 45% of the regular minimum wage, around $3.27 per hour. However, employers must ensure that while calculating overtime, the regular hourly rate for a tipped employee should be considered the standard minimum wage, not the reduced base wage. Employers can use the tip credit system to calculate overtime hours for tipped employees. Overtime calculation for salaried employees in New Hampshire If salaried employees are not exempt, overtime pay calculation is straightforward. Such employees are paid 1.5 times their regular wage rate for hours more than 40 over a work week. In simple terms, their overtime payment will be: 40 hours x regular wage rate + Hours over 40 x (1.5 x regular wage rate) Overtime calculation with commission in New Hampshire For calculating overtime for employees who receive an hourly wage plus commission in New Hampshire, here’s the formula: {((Total hours x Hourly Rate) + Commission) / Total hours} / 2 Suppose an employee earns $15 per hour, works 45 hours a week, and earns a commission of $200. Their new regular pay will be: ($15/hour x 45 hours) + $200 commission = $875 To determine the regular pay rate: $875 / 45 hours = $19.44 per hour. But they will be paid at half this rate, so $19.44 per hour / = $9.72 per hour. Hence, for their extra 5 hours, they will earn $9.72 x 5 = $48.6. Specific considerations for overtime in the Healthcare industry Employers in the healthcare sector can use the “8 and 80” rule for overtime calculations. As per this rule, employees are entitled to overtime pay for hours worked over 8 in a single day or 80 in a 14-day work period, whichever is greater. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) approves this method for hospitals and residential care establishments that may adopt a 14-day work period instead of the typical 7-day workweek. Use of compensatory time as an alternative to overtime pay In New Hampshire, public sector employers can offer employees compensatory time, also known as “comp,” instead of overtime pay. The comp time is offered as additional time off instead of overtime pay for working extra hours. However, private-sector employers cannot use compensatory time as an alternative to overtime pay. In the case of public sector employers, too, employees should be in a collective bargaining agreement with the employer to receive compensatory time. Exceptions and Exemptions in New Hampshire Overtime Laws New Hampshire’s overtime laws generally follow the FLSA exceptions and exemptions. These exceptions often apply to specific job categories or industries: Agricultural workers Seasonal employees Executives Administrative Professional employees making at least $684 per week Misclassification of Independent Contractors A prevalent issue in overtime law compliance is misclassifying employees as independent contractors. However, some employers do it to avoid paying social security taxes, workers’ compensation, and overtime pay. Employers need more than just simply labeling an employee as an independent contractor or even entering into a written agreement to avoid significant legal repercussions for employers. Proper classification requires satisfying all the requirements of a 1099 employee . Impact of Payroll Deductions on Overtime Calculations Payroll deductions can only be implemented if determined by the New Hampshire overtime law or written agreement. During overtime pay calculation, employers must provide a written statement of all deductions made, such as insurance premiums, donations, unemployment taxes, etc. Legal Compliance and Enforcement Requirements for Wage Payments New Hampshire labor law mandates employers to adhere to wage payment regulations, which include providing detailed pay statements and pay stubs. These instruments must clearly outline the hours worked, wages earned, and any deductions made. Regulations Concerning Meal and Rest Breaks for Employees New Hampshire law requires employers to provide 30-minute meals and rest breaks for employees if they are working for more than five consecutive hours. If employers cannot allow time off because of the nature of the work, employees should be paid as they are working and eating simultaneously. Understanding the Statute of Limitations for Unpaid Overtime Claims Employees can take legal action against an employer by filing claims for unpaid overtime in non-compliance. New Hampshire agrees with the FLSA guideline that mandates that an employee can file a claim within 2- 2 years from the date of overtime law violation by the employer. However, this statute can be extended to 3 years if the violation by the employer is wilful. Penalties for Violations of New Hampshire Wage and Overtime Laws Violations of wage and overtime laws in New Hampshire can result in significant penalties, including double the amount of unpaid back wages plus attorneys’ fees incurred by employees. Responsibilities of Employers Regarding Layoffs, Plant Closings, and WARN Notice In layoffs or plant closings, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) is applied to New Hampshire employers, requiring them to inform their employees 60 days in advance about plant closing or mass layoffs. Case Studies and Examples We can look at the McCarthy v. Medicus Healthcare Solutions, LLC case to better understand the implications of violating New Hampshire overtime law. The employee, James McCarthy, sued his employer, Medicus Healthcare Solutions (Medicus), for not paying him overtime wages. He claimed his employer made him work 40 hours a week without proper overtime wages. Furthermore, Medicus maintained records of approved overtime work and pay but not of “off-the-clock” hours. The court ruled that the employer was in wilful violation of the overtime law. Lessons learned here are: Employers refusing overtime compensation knowingly can be tried as wilful violators of the FLSA. Such offense can result in up to 3 years of overtime back wages.

When used correctly, the at-will doctrine forms an employment framework where employers and employees can end their working relationship as needed. However, there are notable exceptions to this doctrine, which are crucial for employers to understand. Contractual Exceptions: Ohio labor laws mandate that if an employment contract exists, either in written or implied form, stipulating the terms for termination, employers must adhere to these contractual obligations. This can include the conditions under which an employee can be terminated. Public Policy Exceptions: Employers in Ohio are prohibited from terminating an employee for reasons that violate public policy. This includes firing an employee for refusing to perform an illegal act, reporting illegal conduct, or exercising legal rights, such as filing workers’ compensation claims. Discrimination and Retaliation: Ohio laws are the same as the federal law that forms the basis for unjustified termination. No employer can terminate an employee based on discriminatory reasons, such as race, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. Additionally, they cannot terminate an employee as retaliation for engaging in protected activities, like filing discrimination complaints or participating in investigations. Right-to-Work Law Ohio recognizes the “right-to-work” law, which pertains to legislation concerning union membership and workers’ rights. The law prohibits employers from refusing candidates to work for their union or employee body membership. The law also states that employment cannot be contingent upon union membership or the payment of union fees. Immigration Verification In Ohio, as in the rest of the United States, immigration verification is critical to employment. Employers can only do additional verification if required for the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. It is a requirement for the verification of the identity and employment authorization of each employee. In Ohio, using E-Verify, an internet-based system that compares information from an employee’s I-9 form to data from U.S. government records, is not mandatory. Drug Testing Employers in Ohio have the right to implement drug testing policies independently. However, the state has no such requirement. While hiring employees, Ohio law does not prohibit drug testing in the workplace. However, contractors working on public projects or government assignments should do mandatory drug testing for all employees per the Ohio Rev. Code § 153.03(B) . The same requirement applies to ambulance driving staff. Jury Duty Leave Ohio PTO laws require employers to provide unpaid time off for jury duty. Employers in Ohio are obligated to provide employees with time off to serve on a jury without penalizing them for their absence. This includes ensuring employees are not subject to adverse employment actions, such as termination or demotion, due to their jury duty service. Voting Leave Voting leave in Ohio is a mandatory time off. Employees can take a reasonable amount of time off work to vote. The amount of time considered “reasonable” can depend on various factors, including the distance from the voting location and the employee’s work schedule. As an employer in Ohio, you are obligated to provide voting leave. You cannot penalize employees for taking time off to vote. Else may face legal challenges and penalties. Employers are encouraged to communicate their voting leave policies clearly to their employees, ensuring that all parties understand their rights and obligations. Military Family Leave the law, eligible employees with up to 10 days or 80 hours of unpaid leave per year when a spouse, parent, or child is called to active duty or is on leave from active duty. It is applied to all employers with 50 or more employees. However, to be eligible for military family leave, an individual must satisfy these conditions: They are employed with an employer with 50 or more employees and have worked for the employer for at least 12 months and at least 1,250 hours during the preceding 12 months. The employee must have a spouse, parent, or child serving in the armed forces, including the National Guard or Reserves, who is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty. The employee must provide 14 days’ notice of intended leave to qualify for military family leave. Military family leave cannot be taken for more than two weeks before the deployment or one week after the deployment. Crime Victim Leave Ohio does not state the permissible leave for a crime victim. Still, employers must allow such employees to participate (at the prosecutor’s request) in preparation for a criminal or delinquency proceeding, to attend a criminal or delinquency proceeding if the employee’s attendance is reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the victim, or to attend a criminal or delinquency proceeding if the employee’s attendance is under their constitutional and statutory rights. Ohio recognizes the importance of supporting employees who are crime victims or who need to represent family members in criminal proceedings. Employers in Ohio must allow employees reasonable time off to attend court proceedings related to a crime in which the employee or a family member is a victim. The eligible employees include crime victims, family members of the victims, or representatives. Ohio allows employees to participate in criminal proceedings, such as hearings or trials, without fear of job loss or retaliation from their employer. Parental Leave Under the Ohio Civil Rights Act, it’s unlawful for employers to discriminate against employees based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. For pregnancy or related conditions, eligible female employees should be provided up to 6 weeks off (four weeks paid and two weeks unpaid). The Act required employers to provide reasonable accommodations and not impose undue hardship on such employees. However, the duration of leave should be determined based on the employee’s individual needs, and the employer should engage in a flexible and understanding approach to these needs. Full-time and part-time employees who work at least 30 hours a week are eligible for parental leave. Smoking Laws Ohio has workplace smoking regulations prohibiting smoking within offline premises, enclosed areas, and just adjacent to the entry and exit of the workplace building. Additionally, employers should put up “No Smoking” signage to inform employees and visitors of smoking restrictions. Employers must comply with these regulations to ensure a smoke-free workplace environment. Break Time to Express Milk Ohio PTO laws do not require employers to provide nursing mothers breaks to express breast milk. However, the federal Fair Labor Standards Act requires that Ohio employers provide a private space for nursing mothers to express breast milk. Meal Breaks Employers in Ohio are not mandated to provide meal or rest breaks for employees; however, per the Ohio Rev. Code § 4109.07(C) regulation, all employees under 18 must be provided at least 30 30-minute breaks when working over five consecutive hours. Minimum Wage, Overtime, and Wage Recordkeeping Ohio has a greater than the federal minimum wage rate. Ohio’s minimum wage rate is $10.10 per hour for hourly workers. For tipped workers, the minimum wage can be up to $5.05 per hour, provided they earn enough tips that make up the minimum wage requirement. Ohio overtime laws align with federal standards, requiring all employers to pay employees 1.5 times the regular wage rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. This overtime requirement doesn’t apply to agricultural workers. Employers must also maintain accurate wage records for up to three years for inspection by the Ohio Department of Commerce director if asked for. Final Payments Ohio labor law stipulates that employers must regularly pay their employees bi-weekly. Payment should be made on or before the first day of each month for work done during the first half of the previous month. The payment for the other half should be made on or before the 15th of each month. This ensures that employees receive timely compensation for their work. Unemployment Insurance Ohio’s unemployment insurance program benefits eligible individuals who have lost their jobs through no fault. Employers should look for the requirement and their contributions towards unemployment insurance for employees based on Ohio’s Department of Job and Family Services requirements. Workers' Compensation Workers’ compensation provides vital protections for both employees and employers in the event of a work-related injury or illness. Under the Ohio Workers’ Compensation Act, all non-self-insured employers must pay insurance premiums to the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation (BWC). Employers who attain self-insured status are exempted from this requirement. Child Labor Ohio labor law prohibits employment of kids under the age of 13, except in limited situations. Minors aged 14 and 15 can work in a broader range of jobs but are subject to strict limitations on their work hours, particularly during school hours. For 16 and 17-year-olds, while most jobs are permissible, there are still prohibitions on working in specific hazardous roles. Gun Laws Public and private employers in Ohio cannot prohibit employees with concealed handgun license (CHL) holders from storing their firearms within their private vehicles. Employers can prohibit employees from bringing firearms into the workplace, including in private offices and company-owned vehicles. However, the law allows employees to store firearms in their cars, even if parked on company property. Additional Laws and Regulations Prohibitions Against Pay Discrimination The Ohio Equal Pay Law (EPL) prohibits wage discrimination based on gender, age, race, color, religion, national origin, or ancestry. Employers must provide equal pay for equal work, regardless of an employee’s mentioned characteristics. Medical Marijuana Policies Ohio is one of the states in the U.S. that legalized medical marijuana. However, it does not require employers to accommodate medical marijuana use in the workplace. Employers have the right to enforce drug-free workplace policies and to prohibit employees from the use, possession, or distribution of medical marijuana at the workplace. Past Compensation Inquiries Employers in Columbus, Toledo, and Cincinnati cannot ask prospective employees about past compensation. Violation of the rule can result in civil fines of up to $5,000.

North Carolina overtime law is one such regulation that outlines the requirements and exceptions regarding overtime pay, employee classification, work hours, and more. You must be aware of North Carolina overtime law requirements as part of your compliance policies. This guide provides: A comprehensive overview of these laws Clarifying eligible hours worked Overtime eligibility and calculation methods Specific rules and exceptions The processes for filing wage complaints Table of Contents Maximum/Minimum Hours Worked Overtime Pay and Hours Worked Employee Classification and Pay Requirement for Non-Exempt Employees to Receive Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Exemptions for Salary Payment Criteria for Exemption from Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Requirements Breaks and Rest Periods Lack of Mandatory Rest Breaks or Meal Breaks for Most Employees Exceptions for Youths Under 16 Years Old Employer Obligations Regarding Break Provisions Minimum Scheduled Hours Overtime Eligibility Overtime Calculation Methods Calculation of overtime pay for hourly employees Considerations for Hourly Employees with Bonuses/Commissions Calculation of overtime pay for salaried employees Specific Rules and Exceptions Eligibility for Overtime Pay for Most Employees Exceptions for Exempt Categories and Seasonal Employees Government Employees’ Entitlement to Compensatory Time Off Statute of Limitations for Collecting Unpaid Overtime Filing Wage Complaints Process for Employees to File Complaints with Relevant Authorities Options for Filing Complaints Overtime for Salaried Employees How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion Maximum/Minimum Hours Worked In North Carolina, state-specific restrictions now limit how many hours employees older than 18 can work per day or week. As long as the employer is compensating accordingly, they can have significant flexibility in their scheduling. Lack of State or Federal Limitations on Hours Worked Per Day or Week Neither the state of North Carolina nor federal law sets a maximum number of hours worked per day or week for adult employees. The only requirement is fair compensation to eligible employees. It is the same for large corporations and smaller businesses. Such lack of a limitation allows firms to operate with considerable freedom in managing work schedules. Employer Discretion in Adjusting Employee Schedules North Carolina labor laws allow employers to alter employee work schedules as needed legally. They have sole discretion to make changes, including mandating overtime work. However, the requirement for fair compensation remains, and employers must follow all the legal requirements for overtime pay. Employers are not required to pay hourly and non-exempt employees for minimum numbers of hours. They should pay only for the hours worked. Overtime Pay and Hours Worked There is no state overtime law in North Carolina, and the state follows the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines on overtime pay . Requirement of Overtime Pay for Non-Exempt Employees According to the FLSA, all non-exempt employees in North Carolina are eligible for overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The overtime rate is one and a half times the employee’s regular pay rate. Discretion of Employers in Mandating Overtime Work Employers in North Carolina can require employees to work overtime as per their requirements. Employees cannot refuse to work overtime shifts. Also, employers have the discretion to change schedules at any time. However, they must compensate the employees at the overtime rate for any hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. Consequences of Refusal to Work Overtime Mandatory overtime is legal in North Carolina. If an employee refuses to work overtime, they can face consequences that can include disciplinary action or even termination. The law allows employers to set work hour requirements as part of the job’s expectations. Employee Classification and Pay In North Carolina, employee classification largely determines minimum wage and overtime pay eligibility. That is why accurate employee classification is mandatory, and any mistake can result in fines and legal action. Requirement for Non-Exempt Employees to Receive Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Generally, all hourly employees are non-exempt under the North California overtime law. Employees must have worked over 40 hours within a work week to be eligible for overtime. Employers are required to pay all employees at least the minimum wage rate of $7.25 per hour. Additionally, the overtime pay rate in North Carolina is 1.5 times the regular pay rate. This minimum wage rate can be lower for tipped employees, provided they consistently get at least $30 commission per week. Exemptions for Salary Payment Specific categories of salaried employees are exempt from overtime payment. In North Carolina, the following categories of salaried employees are exempt: Executives Administrators Season workers Skilled professionals Computer employees who earn $684 per week Outside sales employees Minors There can be other categories, too, and employers must refer to FLSA guidelines to decide who can be exempt from overtime requirements, depending on their duties and salary levels. Criteria for Exemption from Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Requirements Tipped employees and minors are exempted from the minimum wage requirement. As per the FLSA guidelines, as of 2024, tipped employees can be paid a lower than minimum wage rate if their commissions make up for the difference. North Carolina overtime law also allows minors (under 18) to be paid lower than minimum wage. However, in both cases, employers must consider the regular pay rate, not the adjusted wage rate, while calculating the overtime pay. Breaks and Rest Periods Lack of Mandatory Rest Breaks or Meal Breaks for Most Employees North Carolina labor laws do not require employers to provide most employees rest or meal breaks. This policy applies to the adult workforce, allowing employers to determine their break policies. Most employers provide appropriate break time for employees for a more productive workforce and a healthy work environment. Exceptions for Youths Under 16 Years Old For employees under the age of 16, North Carolina requires employees to provide a break of 30 minutes after any period of five consecutive hours of work. Employer Obligations Regarding Break Provisions While not mandatory, employers must follow the federal guidelines if they provide breaks. All short breaks (less than 20 minutes) are generally considered compensable work time, while breaks 30 minutes or longer are unpaid. Minimum Scheduled Hours Obligation of employers to pay employees for actual hours worked In North Carolina, employees have no obligation towards employees to pay for minimum scheduled hours unless they are salaried employees. All hourly employees should be paid for the actual hours worked without obligation for minimum scheduled hours. Furthermore, no state or federal law restricts the maximum number of hours an adult employee can work. Exceptions regarding promised minimum wage payments or benefits The exception is if the employee makes a wage payment agreement with an employee for a certain minimum number of hours. However, giving or not giving the promised wage benefits is entirely up to the employer. There are no state or federal guidelines, and the policies are at the employer’s discretion. Wage benefits can include vacation time, paid sick days, and holiday pay. And if the employer promises such wage benefits, then as per the N.C.G.S. 95-25.13(2) , the employer must: “Make available to its employees, in writing or through a posted notice maintained in a place accessible to its employees, employment practices and policies about promised wages. Overtime Eligibility Generally, non-exempt employees in North Carolina are entitled to overtime pay for hours over 40 in a workweek. It includes most hourly and salaried workers who do not fall into exempt categories (check Exemptions for Salary Payment above). Exemptions for Certain Types of Employees Professional employees, managers, and specific administrative staff may be exempt from overtime pay if they meet specific criteria under the FLSA. This includes: All bona fide professionals who earn not less than $684 per week All highly compensated employees making more than $107,432 a year Computer employees earning at least $27.63 per hour North Carolina’s overtime laws are guided by the FLSA, with additional state-specific regulations where applicable. Overtime Calculation Methods In North Carolina, employers must choose the overtime calculation method based on the type of employee. Calculation of overtime pay for hourly employees Most hourly employees are paid 1.5 times their regular wage rate for overtime hours. Say an employee earns $20/hour. Overtime rate = 1.5 x regular rate. If they work 45 hours a week, the overtime pay for 5 hours is calculated as 5 hours x ($20 x 1.5) = $150. Considerations for Hourly Employees with Bonuses/Commissions The overtime rate of such employees is calculated considering their commissions based on this formula: {((Total hours x Hourly Rate) + Commission) / Total hours} / 2 Assume the same employee as above earns a $100 commission that week. The regular rate becomes ($900 regular pay + $100 commission) / 45 hours = $22.22/hour. The overtime rate is 1.5 x ($22.22/2) = $16.66/hour. Thus, overtime pay = 5 hours x $16.66 = $83.3. Calculation of overtime pay for salaried employees If a salaried employee is non-exempt, they are paid overtime at an FLSA rate of 1.5 times the regular wage rate. For instance, if a salaried employee earns $800/week for a 40-hour workweek, their hourly rate is $800 / 40 = $20/hour. For overtime hours, pay 1.5 x $20. If they work 45 hours, the overtime pay for 5 hours is 5 hours x ($20 x 1.5) = $150. Specific Rules and Exceptions Eligibility for Overtime Pay for Most Employees Most employees in North Carolina are eligible for overtime pay, except those who fall into exempt categories as defined by the FLSA. Exceptions for Exempt Categories and Seasonal Employees Under the North Carolina and federal overtime laws, certain employees, such as executives, professionals, and seasonal workers, may be exempt from overtime pay requirements. However, seasonal employees working for establishments that operate more than seven months a year are eligible for overtime. Exempt category employees earning less than $685 weekly can also be eligible for overtime. Government Employees’ Entitlement to Compensatory Time Off Government employers have the option to offer compensatory time off to employees as an alternative to overtime compensation. However, only public sector employers are eligible for compensatory time off, not private employers. Statute of Limitations for Collecting Unpaid Overtime Under the FLSA, employees can claim unpaid overtime within two years from the violation date. However, if the employer is a wilful violator, this limitation can be extended for three years. Filing Wage Complaints Process for Employees to File Complaints with Relevant Authorities In North Carolina, employees can file a complaint under both the federal and state overtime laws at the same time. Employees can file complaints with the State Department of Labor or the U.S. Department of Labor if they believe their overtime rights have been violated. Options for Filing Complaints Complaints can be filed with the North Carolina Department of Labor or the United States Department of Labor, depending on the nature of the violation. Overtime for Salaried Employees Employers in North Carolina should not consider all salaried employees exempt; there are conditions under which salaried employees are eligible for overtime. Conditions under which salaried employees may receive overtime pay A salaried employee who is not in one of the categories, administrators, managers, skilled employees, or supervisors employed solely to supervise other employees – and makes less than $455 is eligible for overtime.

Paid time off encompasses a range of leave types, such as vacation, sick leave, and other special-purpose leaves. Employers in the state must adhere to federal rules such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and state laws. Understanding PTO laws is crucial for employers and employees, as they impact workplace productivity, employee well-being, and compliance with legal standards. This guide for employers provides essential guidelines about North Carolina PTO laws. Table of Contents FMLA Federal Law Followed in North Carolina Maternal and Paternal Leave Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act Child Care Leave Family Illness Leave Paid Time Off in North Carolina Paid Leaves in North Carolina Parental Leave Organ Donorship Leave American Red Cross Disaster Service Leave Vacation Leave Military Leave Sick Leave in North Carolina Voting Leave in North Carolina Jury Duty Leave Community Service Leave Bereavement Leave PTO Payout on Termination in North Carolina How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion FMLA Federal Law Followed in North Carolina North Carolina necessitates the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for all employers. Enacted in 1993, FMLA entitles the employees of all public agencies, all public and private elementary and secondary schools, and companies with 50 or more employees to unpaid leave. Under the provisions of FMLA, all eligible employees in the state have the right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for family or medical reasons. Employees can take FMLA leaves for several reasons: The birth and care of a newborn child of the employee. The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care. Attend medical needs of an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) suffering from a serious health condition. To time off when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. For any qualifying exigency if the employee is family to a military member on “covered active duty.” To be eligible to benefit under FMLA, an employee should meet the following eligibility requirements: Employees must work for a covered employer for at least 12 months Have worked for at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months Work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles FMLA only applies when time off is for medical and family care reasons. Here are the primary leaves included in the FMLA provisions. Maternal and Paternal Leave North Carolina has no specific state or local maternal and paternal leave laws. However, all employers should follow the FMLA guidelines for maternal and paternal leave. Under the FMLA, employees can take unpaid leave for up to 12 weeks for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child. This provision applies to both mothers and fathers, ensuring equitable access to parental leave. Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act FMLA has ensured that there is no discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), enacted in 1978, prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, ensuring that pregnant employees are treated fairly in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, promotions, and benefits. The Pregnancy Disability Act provides additional protection for employees with pregnancy-related disabilities. This includes access to sick leave, modified work duties, or other reasonable accommodations, ensuring that pregnant employees are not disadvantaged in the workplace due to their condition. Child Care Leave FMLA also includes provisions for child care leave, allowing parents to take time off to care for a child with a serious health condition. North Carolina also has the Small Necessities Law , also known as Parental Involvement Leave, which is part of the child care leave. It allows employees (parents, guardians, or someone standing in Loco Parentis (acting in place of parents)) to take up to 4 hours of unpaid leave to attend a child’s school-related activities. Family Illness Leave Family illness leave is a special provision that allows employees to take unpaid time off due to a family member’s severe medical condition. Employees cannot use family illness leave for their own medical care needs. Under this provision, an employee can take up to 52 weeks of unpaid time off over 5 years. They can use this leave once they have exhausted their FMLA benefits. Paid Time Off in North Carolina North Carolina has no provisions for offering paid time off except paid parental leave. New parents can take 4 to 8 weeks of paid time off to recover from childbirth or bond with their newborn. While North Carolina does not have a state-mandated PTO policy, employers typically offer PTO as part of their benefits package to attract and retain employees. As there are no NC PTO laws, employers can decide the Accrual System if they allow paid time off for their employees. Generally, employers in the state allow employees to accumulate leave over time based on their length of service or the number of hours they work. An accrual system incentivizes long-term employment and provides employees with progressively greater benefits over time. Additionally, North Carolina allows a use-it-or-lose-it policy that prohibits employees from rolling over unused PTO from one year to the next. Employers can require employees to use their PTO within a specific timeframe or forfeit it. Paid Leaves in North Carolina One of the most important aspects of North Carolina PTO laws employers must consider while outlining their policies is paid leave. In the state, there are several types of paid leave, such as parental leave, organ donorship leave, and disaster service leave. Parental Leave North Carolina provides paid parental leave for state employees, ensuring new parents have time to bond with their children without worrying about lost wages. At the same time, private employers must provide paid time off for parental leave of up to 4 to 8 weeks. It applies to a child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement. Eligible employees can take paid parental leave, which can be used consecutively or intermittently within 12 months of the qualifying event. This leave ensures parents have sufficient time to adjust to their new family dynamic and attend to their child’s needs. Organ Donorship Leave North Carolina supports organ and bone marrow donation by requiring employers to allow paid time off for employees who donate. The organ donorship leave gives employees the right to take up to 30 days of paid leave for organ donation or up to 7 days for bone marrow donation. American Red Cross Disaster Service Leave Employees who are a part of the American Red Cross disaster service can take up to 15 days of paid leave annually to assist with disaster recovery efforts. Eligible employees can take up to 15 paid days within 12 months. Vacation Leave Vacation leave policies vary among private employers in North Carolina, with some offering paid vacation while others do not. For North Carolina state employees, vacation leave is typically accrued based on years of service. Here are the duration and corresponding vacation days annually: Worked for less than 5 years – Receive 14 vacation days per year Worked for 5-10 years – Receive 17 vacation days per year Worked for 15-20 years – Receive 23 vacation days per year Worked for 20 or more years – Receive 26 vacation days per year Employees can utilize their vacation time as needed. [b1] Military Leave North Carolina allows paid military leave to state employees, while private employees can be paid or unpaid depending on company policies. State employees can take up to 120 hours of paid time off per fiscal year. This ensures that employees can fulfil their military obligations without losing their civilian jobs. Those on reserve duty can take up to 30 days off with pay, while those in civil air patrol and state defense militia can be granted 120 hours of paid/unpaid time off in a calendar year. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is the federal providing military service members the right to reemployment. It ensures that service members who leave their civilian jobs to perform military service can return to their jobs with the same seniority, status, pay, and other rights as if they had remained continuously employed. Under USERRA, service members may continue their group health coverage for up to 24 months when called for active service. Additionally, they can take up to 5 years of unpaid time off from their employment to serve in the military. Sick Leave in North Carolina North Carolina doesn’t mandate paid sick time off. All employers are required to follow the FMLA guidelines for paid leave; there are no additional state laws. Under the FMLA, all employees can receive up to 12 weeks of time off if eligible. The employees should have worked with their current employer for at least a year to be eligible. They should have worked for at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months and should be working at a site where 50 or more employees are working within a 75-mile radius. Sick leave provides sufficient time to cover illnesses, medical appointments, or other health-related needs. Employees can also use the time for family members’ medical needs, such as caring for a sick child or spouse. Private employers in North Carolina can provide additional sick leave to their employees.  The specifics of sick leave policies, such as accrual rates and maximum allowable leave, can vary depending on the employer and the terms outlined in the employment contract or employee handbook. Voting Leave in North Carolina There is no North Carolina PTO law regarding voting leave, so employers can provide it as a benefit. While there is no legal obligation to provide voting leave, offering this benefit or supporting alternative voting options aligns with a broader commitment to civic engagement and employee welfare. If employers offer voting leave, they have sole discretion to decide whether it is paid or unpaid. Jury Duty Leave Jury duty is a civic responsibility that ensures the legal system functions effectively and fairly. North Carolina requires employers to allow employees time off if they are called for jury duty. While employers are not required to pay employees for jury duty leave, they must allow employees to fulfill this duty without penalty or retaliation. Still, some employers choose to offer paid leave as a benefit. The employee handbook or employment contract typically outlines the decision to offer paid jury duty leave. The court compensates jurors in North Carolina. The compensation is $12 for the first day of service and $20 for each subsequent day. If a juror serves for more than five days, the compensation increases to $40 each day after the fifth day. Community Service Leave Community service leave in North Carolina is only available to state employees. It gives them time off for volunteering and community involvement. This leave is available to volunteer in schools, directly benefiting the educational process for students. State employees can also use community service leave to participate in volunteer activities that support community service organizations or programs and attend parent-teacher conferences or educational activities for their children. The community service leave available to state employees is up to 24 hours per calendar year for full-time employees and none for part-time employees. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave or funeral leave is the time off that allows employees to grieve the loss of a loved one and manage the arrangements surrounding a death. North Carolina has no specific law requiring employers to provide bereavement leave. Generally, employers offer this benefit as part of their leave policies to support employees during difficult times. Bereavement leave policies in North Carolina, such as paid or unpaid leave, typically vary at the employer’s discretion. PTO Payout on Termination in North Carolina Employees often accrue unused vacation time at the end of their service, whether through resignation, retirement, or termination. Employers must understand how accruals and payouts of unused PTO are handled in North Carolina. In North Carolina, employers are not legally required to pay out accrued, unused vacation time upon termination unless their policies or employment contracts state otherwise. This is why employers must create clear payout policies or any specific agreements and communicate them to their employees. These policies should be outlined in the employee handbook or employment contract and must be consistently followed. Employers who promise to pay out accrued vacation time in writing or through consistent practice are generally obligated to fulfill this promise. How can Truein help with Paid time off management?

Washington state PTO laws are shaped by federal and state regulations, providing employees access to various leave types, including vacation, sick leave, and special-purpose leaves. WA PTO laws serve the dual purpose of protecting employee welfare and fostering a productive and healthy workforce. If you run a business in Washington or operate in the state, this guide will help you explore the various aspects of PTO in Washington and highlight the federal regulations, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Table of Contents FMLA Federal Law followed in Washington Maternal and Paternal Leave Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act Child Care Leave Family Illness Leave Paid Time Off in Washington Paid Leaves in Washington Sick Leave Seattle’s Paid Sick and Safe Time (PSST) Tacoma’s Paid Sick Leave Washington State Family and Medical Leave Parental Leave Organ Donorship Leave Vacation Leave Military Leave Voting Leave in Washington Jury Duty Leave Community Service Leave Bereavement Leave Domestic Violence Leave Employers' Responsibilities for Implementing a Paid Sick Leave Policy and Requirements Payout Requirements on Termination in Washington How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion FMLA Federal Law followed in Washington The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law that applies nationwide, including to all employers in Washington. It applies to employers with 50 or more employees. Under FMLA, all eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year for specific family and medical reasons. FMLA is an umbrella provision that includes maternal and paternal leave, protections under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, child care leave, and family illness leave. To be eligible for FMLA, employees must: Work for an employer with 50 or more employees. This includes public agencies, schools, and private-sector employers. Have worked for the employer for at least 12 months. Have at least 1,250 hours of service over the past 12 months. Work at a location with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. There are certain leaves included within FMLA: Maternal and Paternal Leave Employers must offer eligible employees maternal or paternal time off for a child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement. Employees take maternal/paternal leave within one year of the child’s birth or placement, and it can be taken intermittently or as a continuous block of time. Under this provision, parents can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off for prenatal care, pregnancy complications, childbirth, and recovery or adoption or welcome a child into foster care. Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The act mandates that no employer can treat a pregnant employee unfavorably regarding hiring, firing, promotions, job assignments, or benefits. It also has provisions for reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees, such as light duty or temporary reassignment, similar to employees with other medical conditions. The Pregnancy Disability Act requires employers to provide employees with pregnancy-related disabilities the same benefits as those with other temporary disabilities. This includes access to sick leave, modified work duties, or other reasonable accommodations. Child Care Leave FMLA also covers child care leave, allowing parents to take time off to care for a child with a serious health condition. As per FMLA, serious health is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. Family Illness Leave In Washington, all employers must offer paid family and medical leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition. This provision recognizes the importance of family support during medical crises and gives employees the flexibility to fulfill their caregiving responsibilities. Under this provision, an employee can take family illness leave for immediate family members, including: Spouses: Legal spouses, including same-sex spouses. Children: Biological, adopted, or foster children, stepchildren, legal wards, or children for whom the employee stands in loco parentis (acting as parents). Parents: Biological, adoptive, step, or foster parents, or individuals who stood in loco parentis to the employee as a child. Employers don’t have to bear the cost of this paid vacation as a state fund funds it. Employers pay 27.24%, and employees pay 72.76% of the contribution to the fund. However, smaller businesses (with less than 50 employees) are not required to pay the premium; the state contributes its share. Paid Time Off in Washington Washington does not have a mandatory paid time off provision, and policies regarding it are at employers’ discretion. The accrual systems and roll-over policies for these types of leave vary depending on the employer and the type of leave. Employers in Washington are under no legal obligation to use an accrual system for PTO. They allow employees to earn a certain amount of leave based on their length of service or hours worked, which depends on their policies. Some employers also use a fixed accrual rate per pay period, such as a certain number of hours for every week or month worked, which ensures that employees steadily accumulate leave. Washington is among the states that allow a use-it-or-lose-it policy. This means employers have no obligation to allow employees to roll over unused PTO from one year to the next. Still, many employers allow the rollover of accrued PTO as a benefit. The roll-over policy varies by employer and is often outlined in the employee handbook or employment contract. Paid Leaves in Washington Washington has established several paid leave laws that benefit employees, covering situations like sickness, family care, and medical emergencies. Employers in the state should be aware of the paid leaves they must provide their employees for compliance. Sick Leave FMLA applies to all employers and provides employees with the right to up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. Washington has paid sick leave laws throughout the state. However, the cities of Seattle and Tacoma have their policies. Under Washington’s paid sick leave law, employees earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked. Employers can use the paid sick time for their illness, injury, health condition, or a family member. It can also be used for time off to deal with domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Additionally, employers must allow employees to carry over up to 40 hours of unused paid sick leave into the following year. Seattle’s Paid Sick and Safe Time (PSST) Seattle has the Paid Sick and Safe Time (PSST) ordinance, which applies to employers with employees who work within Seattle city limits. Under the PSST provision, the amount of paid sick leave accrual varies based on the employer’s size. All employers with up to 49 employees must provide one hour of leave for every 40 hours worked. They must allow a maximum accrual of 40 hours per year. Employers with 50 to 249 employees must provide one hour of PSST for every 40 hours worked. Such employees can accrue up to 56 hours annually. Employers with 250 or more employees must provide one hour of leave for every 30 hours worked, with a maximum accrual of 72 hours annually. PSST covers absences covered under Washington paid sick law, including illness, health conditions, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Tacoma’s Paid Sick Leave Employers in Tacoma must provide paid sick leave to their employees who work more than 80 hours in a year. According to Tacoma’s paid sick leave law, employees earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked, up to a maximum accrual of 24 hours annually. Employees can carry over 40 hours of unused leave into the following year. Washington State Family and Medical Leave Washington’s Family Leave Insurance program, also known as Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML), provides paid leave benefits for family and medical reasons. Under this program, all eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of paid leave annually. PFML can be used for: Bonding with a newborn or newly placed child. Caring for a family member with a serious health condition. Recovering from the employee’s serious health condition. Dealing with a military exigency arising from a family member’s deployment. The PFML benefits can be extended up to 16 weeks if there are more than one qualifying family and medical reasons. It can be up to 18 weeks of paid leave for female employees who face pregnancy complications that result in incapacity. The Washington Family Care Act is another provision that protects the rights of employees for paid sick time off to take care of their children, a spouse or domestic partner, a parent/ parent-in-law, or a grandparent. Parental Leave Under Washington’s PFML program, new parents are allowed to take paid parental leave for the birth or placement of a child. This leave is available to mothers and fathers, supporting bonding and family well-being. All parents can take up to 12 weeks time off in the first year after child’s birth or placement under parental leave. Organ Donorship Leave Executive agencies in Washington must provide paid organ donorship leave for employees who donate an organ or bone marrow. Private employers have no obligation, and it depends on their company policies to offer leave for donorship. Organ donorship leave allows state employees to take up to 7 days of paid time off for bone marrow donation and up to 30 days of paid leave for organ donation. Vacation Leave No federal or state law in Washington requires employers to offer paid vacation time to employees. The decision is at the employer’s discretion. While no state law requires employers to provide vacation leave, many employers offer this benefit to attract and retain employees. Military Leave Military leave in Washington is governed by the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and the local state law. Under USERRA, employees can take up to 5 years of unpaid time off for active service in the military. Employees are obligated to provide time off for military service. Also, such employees must continue to receive group health coverage for up to 24 months. Washington’s state law protects employees who are reservists or members of the National Guard. Voting Leave in Washington Employers in Washington are not obligated to provide time off, paid or unpaid, for voting. However, most employers still allow time for employees who do not get enough time outside work hours to vote. Jury Duty Leave Jury duty is an important civic responsibility, and Washington protects employees called to serve as jurors. The state requires employers to provide unpaid leave for jury duty. The duration of the leave can be as long as the duty requires. Employees do not have to pay for jury duty leave, as the court pays jurors $10 a day. Community Service Leave Private employers are not required to offer community service leave. However, all state employers must. State employees can use community service leave to participate in community-building activities and assistance responsibilities. Bereavement Leave There is no federal or state law on bereavement leave in Washington. Employers can provide paid or unpaid bereavement leave to employees in difficult times at their sole discretion. Domestic Violence Leave Victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking can ask for domestic violence leave without any fear of retaliation from their employers. Domestic violence leave can be counted against paid time off or unpaid. Affected employees can use domestic violence leave for: Legal or law enforcement assistance and court proceedings Seeking psychological and medical help Assistance from social service programs Plan for their safety Relocating Employers' Responsibilities for Implementing a Paid Sick Leave Policy and Requirements Employers must create comprehensive policies to ensure transparency and compliance with the implementation of the paid sick leave policy. The policies must be communicated with the employees. Here are the details to include: Accrual Rates How employees can use paid sick leave Carryover details and how to apply for roll-over All existing and new policies must meet the minimum requirements of state laws or local ordinances. Even if you do not have a written paid sick leave policy in place, you must meet the minimum state requirement, which is providing one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked to all eligible employees. In addition to comprehensive policies, employees should ensure accurate accrual tracking using tools like Truein. Employers in Washington must also maintain detailed records of paid sick leave and report this information as required by the state. Payout Requirements on Termination in Washington Washington has no laws on PTO payouts upon termination from service, whether through resignation or retirement. Employers are not legally required to pay out accrued, unused vacation time upon termination unless their policies or employment contracts state otherwise. Employers must maintain clear policies regarding the payout of accrued, unused vacation upon termination to avoid misunderstandings and potential disputes.

As an employer, it is your responsibility to understand California overtime rules as well as federal laws. The state has more generous overtime laws than the federal laws, providing greater protection to employees. In California, all employers should pay employees overtime if they work more than 8 hours a day or more than 40 hours a week. The overtime rate cannot be less than one and a half times the employee’s regular pay rate for hours worked beyond the standard thresholds. In this guide on California OT laws, we explore various aspects of these laws, such as regular pay, how bonuses impact overtime calculations, minimum wage standards, and specific overtime rules for different types of employees. Table of Contents What is the Regular Rate of Pay? Impact of Bonuses on Overtime Calculation Types of Bonuses Calculation of Overtime with Bonuses Minimum Wage Rates in California Calculating Overtime for Hourly-paid Employees Calculating Overtime for Salaried Employees Calculating Overtime for Commission-based Employees Overtime Calculations for Employees with Multiple Pay Rates Which Employees Are Eligible for Overtime?

What happens if an employee works unauthorized overtime? How can Truein help with Overtime Pay management? Conclusion What is the Regular Rate of Pay? To calculate overtime pay accurately, it is essential to understand the concept of a regular rate of pay. The regular rate of pay includes hourly earnings, salaries, piecework earnings, commissions, and certain bonuses. Employers must consider all forms of payments employees receive, not just hourly earnings, for the regular rate of pay calculations. An important consideration is that the regular rate of pay cannot be less than the minimum wage set by the state. In California, there is no standard minimum wage; it varies depending on the size of the employer and is subject to periodic increases. The regular rate of pay is calculated by dividing the total compensation earned in a workweek by the total number of hours worked. This rate must not fall below the applicable minimum wage. Impact of Bonuses on Overtime Calculation Bonuses can have a significant impact on the calculation of overtime pay. CA overtime calculation must include all forms of remuneration that an employee earns. When there are certain types of bonuses, the regular rate of pay changes for the period for which bonuses are received. Understanding the relationship between bonuses and overtime pay is essential for compliance in California. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), reinforced by California labor laws, dictates how bonuses are incorporated into the regular rate of pay to calculate overtime. Therefore, state employers must be aware of the different types of bonuses and how to include them in the regular rate of pay calculation. Types of Bonuses While several kinds of bonuses can exist, in California, all bonuses typically fall into two categories: discretionary and non-discretionary. Discretionary Bonuses : The bonuses at the employer’s full discretion over the fact and amount of payment are discretionary. Such bonuses are not promised or expected but act as a surprise. For instance, if a company offers a holiday bonus based on its profitability, it will be a discretionary bonus. Non-Discretionary Bonuses: All formal bonuses promised to employees, such as bonuses for achieving sales targets, maintaining attendance, or meeting performance goals, are non-discretionary. Non-discretionary bonuses must be included in the regular pay rate when calculating overtime. Calculation of Overtime with Bonuses Only non-discretionary bonuses are included in the regular pay rate when calculating overtime. Let’s understand with an example: An employee earns a base hourly wage of $20 and works 45 hours weekly. The employee also earns a $200 non-discretionary performance bonus for achieving the sales target set by the employer. The regular rate of pay is calculated as follows: Total earnings = (40 hours × $20) + (5 hours × $30) + $200 bonus = $800 + $150 + $200 = $1,150 Regular rate of pay = $1,150 ÷ 45 hours = $25.56 Overtime rate = $25.56 × 1.5 = $38.34 Overtime pay = 5 hours × $38.34 = $191.70 Therefore, the total weekly earnings, including overtime and the bonus, would be $1,150 + $191.70 = $1,341.70. Minimum Wage Rates in California As of January 1, 2024, the minimum wage in California for most employers is $16.00/hour. However, fast-food restaurant employers will have to pay their employees a higher minimum wage of $20.00 per hour from April 1, 2024. The Healthcare Facility employers will also have higher minimum wage rate requirements effective June 1, 2024. Such employers’ higher minimum wage obligation will be $25 per hour. Calculating Overtime for Hourly-paid Employees According to the state of California overtime laws, overtime calculation for hourly-paid employees is straightforward. The overtime is calculated as follows: Employees are paid 1.5 times the regular hourly wage for hours worked over 8 and up to 12 in a day or 40 in a week and for the first 8 hours of the seventh consecutive work day. Employees are paid double the regular wage rate for hours worked over 12 in a day or over 8 on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. Calculating Overtime for Salaried Employees For salaried employees, the regular rate of pay is calculated by dividing the annual salary by 52 to find the weekly wage rate and further dividing the rate by 40 for the regular hourly wage rate. Then, the overtime calculation is the same as for hourly employees based on the regular pay rate. Calculating Overtime for Commission-based Employees The regular pay rate for piecework employees is calculated based on the total earnings divided by the total hours worked in a week. Then, they are paid overtime at 1.5 times the regular wage rate at a flat rate. For commission-based employees, the regular pay rate is first calculated by adding the commissions earned to the hourly earnings and dividing by the number of hours worked. Overtime Calculations for Employees with Multiple Pay Rates If an employee works at two or more different pay rates, the regular rate of pay is the weighted average of the different rates. The weighted average is calculated by dividing the total earnings by the total hours worked. Let’s understand this with an example: Suppose an employee works under two different pay rates during the same week: 30 hours at $20 per hour 20 hours at $25 per hour Total hours worked = 50 hours Step 1 : Calculate total earnings from each rate: $20/hour * 30 hours = $600 $25/hour * 20 hours = $500 Total earnings = $600 + $500 = $1,100 Step 2 : Total hours worked = 50 hours Step 3 : Calculate the weighted average pay rate: Weighted average pay rate = Total earnings / Total hours worked Weighted average pay rate = $1,100 / 50 = $22 per hour Step 4 : Calculate overtime pay: Overtime hours = 50 total hours – 40 standard hours = 10 hours Overtime pay rate = 1.5 * $22/hour = $33/hour Overtime pay = 10 hours * $33/hour = $330 Step 5 : Total Pay for the Week : Regular pay (40 hours * $22/hour) = $880 Overtime pay = $330 Total pay = $880 + $330 = $1,210 Which Employees Are Eligible for Overtime? The California overtime rules cover most employees in California, including hourly, salaried, and commission-based workers. However, eligibility depends on factors such as job duties, compensation, and the nature of the employment relationship. Unless an employee falls into the exempt category of workers and is 18 years or older (or 16/17 years old and legally allowed to work instead of school), they will be eligible for overtime. To be eligible for overtime, here are the minimum requirements: Employees should work more than 8 hours in a single workday Employees working more than 40 hours per week are entitled to overtime. Employees working on the seventh consecutive day of a workweek are entitled to overtime for the first 8 hours worked that day at 1.5 times the regular wage rate. Employees working more than 12 hours per day qualify for double-time pay. Employees working more than 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of a workweek qualify for double time for hours worked beyond 8. Which Employees Are Exempt from Overtime? Certain categories of employees are exempt from the protections of the California overtime laws. It includes the following categories: Executive employees are primarily employed in management roles and direct the work of at least two other employees. Administrative employees whose primary duty involves office or non-manual work directly related to management or general business operations and who exercise discretion and independent judgment. Professional employees require advanced knowledge, predominantly intellectual, and consistent exercise of discretion and judgment. Outside salespersons working away from the employer’s place of business. Computer professionals make at least $27.63 an hour. Agricultural workers Overtime wage laws do not protect exempt employees, but they are generally subject to higher minimum salary requirements and have specific duties that align with their exemption. Unionized Employees and the Bargaining Agreement Unionized employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement are not covered under the California OT laws. However, this is true only if the collective bargaining agreement has different overtime provisions than those outlined in California law. If the agreement has the following three conditions: 1. Definition of work hours, work conditions, and wages 2. The regular wage rate of 30% or higher than the California minimum wage rate 3. Wage rates for overtime hours Then, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement take precedence. If these conditions are not met, unionized employees are considered non-exempt and paid according to California labor laws. Unauthorized Overtime When an employee works overtime that the employer does not authorize, it is termed unauthorized overtime. Whether the overtime hours were approved or not, the California overtime rules are clear. Employers must pay for all hours worked, including unauthorized overtime. The overtime pay cannot be docked as a disciplinary action. Employers must use effective scheduling and strict authorizations to prevent the abuse of overtime rules. Employers' Rights and Responsibilities towards Overtime for Employees Managing overtime effectively is essential for workforce management and a legal requirement under California labor laws. Employers must navigate overtime regulations while upholding their responsibilities to compensate employees fairly according to state and federal standards. Here are the rights and responsibilities of the employers. Keeping Track of Overtime and Compliance Employers are responsible for accurately tracking and recording employee hours, including overtime. Additionally, company policies on overtime must comply with state and federal laws regarding overtime pay and ensure that employees are compensated accurately. Consent/Refusal of Employees California labor laws recognize the workers’ right to refuse overtime unless stated otherwise in the employer’s policy and any applicable collective bargaining agreements. However, some jobs, such as those related to health and safety, require overtime in emergencies. Providing Notice Before Scheduling Overtime While not required by law, employers should provide reasonable notice before scheduling overtime, especially if it is mandatory. It is necessary to foster a positive work culture and allow employees to plan their time and avoid conflicts. Overtime Compensation and Legal Requirements Accurate overtime payment is the responsibility of the employers and is required by law. Failure to do so can result in legal penalties, including back pay, fines, and damages. FAQs Q1. If an employee works unauthorized overtime, must the employer pay for it? Yes, California labor law overtime pay guidelines clearly state that employers are required to pay employees for all hours worked, including unauthorized overtime. However, it is important to note that disciplinary actions against unauthorized overtime should not include withholding pay for hours worked. Q2. Can an employee waive his or her right to overtime compensation? No, employees cannot waive their right to overtime compensation in California. Any agreement that attempts to waive overtime pay is considered void and unenforceable. Q3. What are the employer penalties for retaliation towards an employee’s overtime? Employers who retaliate against employees for asserting their rights can be found guilty of wage theft. Retaliatory actions such as termination, demotion, or reducing an employee’s hours or pay will result in penalties. These penalties include reinstatement, back pay, damages, and civil penalties. Q4. What are the exceptions to general overtime rules? Here are the general exceptions: Exempt executive, administrative, and professional employees who meet specific criteria. Unionized employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that have different overtime rules specified in their agreements. Employees who work alternative workweek schedules that allow for longer daily hours without overtime pay provided the schedule is adopted according to the law. Q5. Can an employer require an employee to work overtime? Yes, employers can require employees to work overtime as they have the right to set work schedules and require overtime as long as they pay the appropriate overtime rates. Q6. What happens if an employee works unauthorized overtime? If an employee works unauthorized overtime, the employer must still pay for the hours worked.

Fortunately, solutions are available to help with restaurant employee scheduling . This guide will explore how to conduct restaurant workforce management for operational efficiency, employee satisfaction, and quality customer service.

Factors to Consider When Creating Schedules Compliance with labor laws and regulations Peak hours and busy periods Employee availability and preferences Benefits and Challenges of Restaurant Scheduling Advantages of restaurant employee scheduling: Challenges of restaurant scheduling: How Truein Helps with Restaurant Scheduling Conclusion What is Employee Scheduling at Restaurants, and why is it important? In simple terms, employee scheduling involves assigning work shifts to employees within an establishment. While employee scheduling can be simple for some businesses due to the nature of the operations, in the context of a restaurant, this task becomes particularly critical. A schedule for restaurant staff has to account for the fluctuating customer footfall, varying shift requirements, and the need for a diverse set of skills across different times of the day. However, effective scheduling is necessary for restaurants as it helps manage labor costs, optimizes staff productivity, enhances customer service, and ensures that the right number of employees are available at the right time. Types of Restaurant Employee Scheduling Several restaurant employee scheduling models are available. The choice depends on how much automation and efficiency you require for your restaurant operations. Technology-Driven Scheduling You must incorporate modern technology in scheduling. Modern restaurant scheduling software solutions like Truein are designed to facilitate more efficient scheduling through creating a custom schedule or using a previously used schedule. Such a technology-driven scheduling solution can help significantly reduce the time managers spend on creating effective schedules. Truein is designed to be the go-to choice for the restaurant industry, offering features like real-time attendance tracking, automated shift assignments based on predefined rules, and mobile accessibility. It allows managers to effortlessly create, modify, and optimize restaurant staff schedules for accuracy and adaptability to sudden changes in staffing needs. Fixed Schedules Fixed schedules are the most widely used type of scheduling, where employees work the same weekly shifts. This consistency helps employees manage their personal lives better because of predictable work hours such as 7 am—3 pm, 3 pm—11 pm, and 11 pm—7 am. However, the stability of fixed schedules makes it challenging to handle the dynamic changes in customer flow typical in the restaurant industry. Fixed schedules may be appropriate for your establishment if the volume of your business is steady and predictable. Flexible Scheduling Flexible scheduling, also known as open scheduling, allows employees to have varying shifts that they can sometimes choose based on availability. Flexible employee restaurant schedules are advantageous for both employer and employees as restaurant workers can accommodate other commitments such as schooling or second jobs. It helps restaurants manage labor costs more effectively by aligning staff levels closely with business volumes. However, flexible scheduling in the restaurant business requires more communication and coordination to ensure that all shifts are covered. Demand-Driven Scheduling Demand-driven scheduling utilizes expected customer flow forecasting to plan staff shifts accordingly. It is a proactive approach benefiting from historical data and trends to predict busy times and schedule more staff during peak periods while reducing staff during slower times. This type of scheduling is highly efficient in managing labor costs and can improve customer service by ensuring adequate staffing when needed. Rotating Shifts Rotating shifts involves cycling employees through different shifts every week. This scheduling form ensures everyone shares the burden of less desirable work hours, like late nights or early mornings. In the hospitality industry, rotating shifts can help keep the scheduling fair and equitable among staff, potentially increasing job satisfaction and reducing turnover. Split Shifts As seen in the restaurant industry, split shifts involve employees working a set of hours during the day, taking a break, and returning for another set of hours. For example, employees can work from 11 am to 3 pm, take a break, and return from 8 pm to 12 am. This type of schedule can be beneficial in bridging gaps during mid-day slow footfall and then covering the busy evening rush. Seasonal Scheduling Seasonal scheduling is appropriate for establishments where footfall is significantly affected seasonally, such as restaurants in tourist areas or those impacted by seasonal events. This type of scheduling requires strategic planning and recruitment to scale up operations during busy months and scale down in the off-season. Restaurants in tourist spots use seasonal scheduling to ensure optimal staff utilization and service level throughout the year. Steps to Make a Restaurant Schedule for Employees Creating a well-organized restaurant schedule is more than just a routine administrative task. Here are a few practical steps to streamline your scheduling process, ensuring you have the right staff at the right time, minimize labor costs, and boost team morale. 1. Choose a Good Restaurant Scheduling Software and Create Your Restaurant Schedule Template The first step is to choose a robust employee scheduling software for restaurants that can help you use technology for your business operations. A good scheduling tool like Truein offers features that allow easy creation and modification of schedules, real-time communication capabilities, and integration with other systems such as payroll and HR. It makes the scheduling process efficient by minimizing human errors. To optimize the scheduling process, create a restaurant schedule template that works for you and can be used repeatedly. 2. Pay Attention to Business Demands and Employee Strength Understanding the ebb and flow of your business and recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of your workers is essential for effective scheduling. When you anticipate busy periods and customer demands, you can match them with appropriate employee skills, roles, and performance. Matching the right person to the right shift is necessary to ensure your team is strong when your restaurant is busiest. 3. Setting Up Shifts and Duties You must clearly define the shift structure, including the length of shifts, the number of staff needed per shift, and the specific roles required during the shifts. Duties should be assigned based on the employee’s skills and the restaurant’s operational needs. 4. Schedule Busy Shifts First The priority of the scheduling should be to cover peak times such as lunch, dinner, weekends, or special occasions. By prioritizing scheduling for busy shifts, you can guarantee that the best workers are available during the most needed hours. 5. Assign Shifts According to Availability You cannot have an effective schedule if you are not aware of the availability of the workers. Collect and consider employee availability before assigning shifts to avoid conflicts and last-minute changes. 6. Handle Changes in Shifts Your employees must be aware of the process for handling shift changes. This is another aspect of restaurant employee scheduling that can be well handled by using software that effectively informs workers about shift changes. You can establish a shift swap system among employees or have on-call staff for unexpected needs. 7. Avoid Back-to-Back Shifts You don’t want cranky staff handling your customers. Avoid scheduling employees for consecutive closing and opening shifts to prevent employee burnout and maintain employee well-being and productivity. 8. Maintain Communications Regarding the Schedule Effective communication is an integral part of restaurant employee scheduling. All your employees should have access to their schedules well in advance, and any changes should be communicated promptly. 9. Enhance Flexibility in Shift Changes When Needed Shift schedule flexibility leads to higher employee satisfaction and retention. Allowing for shift changes to accommodate personal emergencies or requests fosters a supportive workplace culture. 10. Make the Schedule Easy to Access Ultimately, you must ensure that your perfectly crafted shift schedules are easily accessible to all employees. Truein offers a mobile app that allows employees to check their schedules from anywhere at any time. This accessibility reduces confusion and missed shifts, ensuring smooth operations. Best Practices and Tips for Restaurant Scheduling Here, we discuss strategies and insights to help in enhancing employee satisfaction and operational efficiency through scheduling. Whether you’re looking to fine-tune your current practices or overhaul your scheduling approach entirely, here are the best practices. 1. Cross-train employees Restaurants need specific skills and roles for each shift. However, if you cross-train your employees, you’ll be prepared for the days when you are understaffed. For example, a busy weekend evening might require more servers, and your cleaning staff can take on the role if they are cross-trained. 2. Plan and honor time off requests Ensure that your employees and new hires know the schedule requirements and how much time they are expected to work. Explain to them the number of consecutive working days, the duration of shifts, and their roles’ physical and mental demands. Honor the time off requests to ensure your workers know you care for them. Ensuring employees have adequate time off is crucial for maintaining a healthy and motivated workforce. 3. Plan for holidays Create a holiday time off policy to ensure that your staff is available at certain times of the year, such as holidays or local festivals. To keep them motivated, consider offering them time and a half or double pay for working during the holiday season. Additionally, you can schedule time off shortly after the holiday rush to help them rest after working hard. 4. Analyze Previous Schedules Regularly reviewing feedback on previous schedules can provide valuable insights. The data can help you decide what works and what doesn’t for your restaurant, discover any blind spots in your scheduling process, and learn from past schedules to make future scheduling more effective. 5. Gather feedback from employees . Ultimately, your employees can provide valuable insights about the sore points of the scheduling process. Establish open communication channels to encourage employees to provide honest feedback on the scheduling process. Factors to Consider When Creating Schedules When creating a schedule for your restaurant employees, you have to consider some crucial things. Here are the factors to ensure that your scheduling optimizes workforce management, reduces turnover, and complies with applicable labor laws. Compliance with labor laws and regulations Restaurants require more dynamic scheduling than most businesses, which makes them susceptible to compliance issues. Adhering to labor laws and regulations, including regulations on minimum wage, overtime, working hours, and mandatory breaks, is essential. Peak hours and busy periods Maintaining effective employee restaurant schedules without identifying peak hours and busy periods will be challenging. You must analyze sales data, customer traffic patterns, and event calendars to anticipate peak hours and busy periods. Employee availability and preferences It is important to consider when employees are available to ensure they are not turning down shifts or unhappy at work. If your schedules consider their preferred working hours, it can affect morale and reduce turnover. You will have a more engaged workforce, and they will perform better if they work shifts that suit their personal lives. Benefits and Challenges of Restaurant Scheduling Restaurant scheduling is a critical task that directly impacts both operational success and workplace atmosphere. However, the benefit of a restaurant’s efficiency and employee satisfaction comes with some hurdles that can complicate achieving these benefits. Here are the key advantages of restaurant employee scheduling and the common challenges that can arise as well. Advantages of restaurant employee scheduling: Optimized labor costs as restaurant owners can align staff needs with customer demand. Improved customer service due to adequate staffing during peak times without compromising service speed and quality. Fair and flexible scheduling results in more job satisfaction, reduced turnover, and improved morale. Streamlined scheduling improves overall restaurant operational efficiency by matching the right staff with the right skills to the right role and shift. Challenges of restaurant scheduling: Accommodating employee preferences with the demands of scheduling is complicated and time-consuming. Even with the best tools, anticipating customer flow can be difficult, making it challenging to schedule the correct number of employees for peak hours. Shift changes, illness, and emergencies result in last-minute changes that can disrupt even the most carefully planned schedules.

That’s why Wisconsin PTO laws protect employees’ rights to take time off when they need it. As an employer, it is important to frame company leave policies guided by federal and state regulations, ensuring employees have access to the necessary leave when needed. This Wisconsin PTO payout laws guide covers different aspects, such as maternity and paternity leave, sick leave, vacation leave, military leave, voting leave, jury duty leave, bereavement leave, and more. Table of Contents FMLA Federal Law followed in Wisconsin Maternity and Paternity Leave Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act Child Care Leave Family Illness Leave Paid Time Off in Wisconsin Sick Leave Bone Marrow and Organ Donation Leave Vacation Leave Military Leave Voting Leave in Wisconsin Jury Duty Leave Bereavement Leave Civil Air Patrol Leave PTO Payout on Termination in Wisconsin How can Truein help with Paid time off management? Conclusion FMLA Federal Law followed in Wisconsin The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees in Wisconsin with unpaid, job-protected leave for specific family and medical reasons. All employers in the state must adhere to the guidelines of FMLA, promising employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in 12 months for any of the following reasons: The birth and care of a newborn child Adoption or foster care placement of a child Medical care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) suffering from a serious health condition Employee’s serious health condition leaving them incapable of performing their duties An eligible employee for FMLA benefits meets the following criteria: Working with the current employee for at least 12 months Worked at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months Works at a location where 50 or more employees work within 75 miles radius There are certain leaves covered under FMLA, this includes: Maternity and Paternity Leave Under the FMLA, new parents can take unpaid maternity or paternity leave for up to 12 weeks to care for their newborn child. The act ensures that both mothers and fathers can take time off within 12 months of the child’s birth to care for and bond with the child. Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Pregnancy Disability Act To further protect the rights of pregnant employees, the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) prohibits any discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The Pregnancy Disability Act also provides the same rights to pregnant employees unable to perform their duties due to pregnancy as other disability acts. Both these acts require employers to treat pregnant employees fairly and entitle them to reasonable accommodations if needed during pregnancy. Child Care Leave Under FMLA, parents can take leave for adoption or foster care placement. This leave is intended to help families transition during these important life events, ensuring that employees do not have to choose between their jobs and family. Child care leave is unpaid. Child care leave entitled employees: To take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child care Use unpaid time off for attending to the requirements of child including medical care, school obligations, etc. Six weeks of leave within 16 weeks before or after the birth or adoption Family Illness Leave The family illness leave provision of FMLA entitles all employees within the state of Wisconsin to take up to 12 weeks of FMLA leave to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) who suffers from a serious health condition. Employees cannot use family illness leave for their medical care. In addition to the FMLA, Wisconsin state law allows employees to take up to two weeks per year to attend to the serious health condition of a parent (including parents-in-law), child, or spouse. Paid Time Off in Wisconsin There are no state laws on Paid time off (PTO) in Wisconsin, and policies regarding PTO are generally governed by employer policies. However, many employers offer PTO as a benefit to attract and retain employees. Wisconsin has no law that mandates employers to allow accrual of PTO. However, if employers decide to allow accrual of paid time off, they must mention how employees earn leave based on the time they work. For example, an employee might earn one day of PTO for every month worked. Additionally, in Wisconsin use-it-or-lose-it” policy is not prohibited, giving employers the right to prohibit the rollover of accrued, unused PTO. Sick Leave In Wisconsin, all employers are required to abide by the FMLA federal provisions and provide eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid sick leave. Under FMLA, employees can use sick to: Take care of their serious medical condition Birth or adoption of a child Care for a family member suffering from a serious medical condition In addition to the federal FMLA, the state also has the Wisconsin Family and Medical Leave Act (WFMLA) governing employee sick leave. The WFMLA applies to all employers with 50 or more employees. The WFMLA provides eligible employees with unpaid leave for: Up to two weeks of leave for an employee’s serious health condition Up to two weeks of leave to care for a parent, child, or spouse with a serious health condition Up to six weeks of leave for the birth or adoption of a child Bone Marrow and Organ Donation Leave The Bone Marrow and organ donation leave act states that employees who are donating bone marrow or an organ can take “no more than six weeks of leave in 12 months” to “undergo the bone marrow or organ donation procedure and to recover from the procedure.” Employers can ask for written verification from employees to ensure that they have bone marrow or organ donation scheduled before they approve time off. Vacation Leave Vacation leave in Wisconsin is not mandated by state law, meaning employers are not required to provide paid or unpaid vacation. However, if the employers offer vacation leave as a benefit, they must mention it in the employee handbooks and employment contracts. The policy should also cover whether this leave is paid or unpaid. Employees can hold employers accountable for providing paid/unpaid vacation leave if it is included in their work contract. Military Leave Wisconsin has federal and state laws regarding military leave that employers must adhere to. The federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is applicable throughout the state. It provides protections for employees serving in the military for up to five years to take time off for military service. Under USERRA, employees who leave for military service have the right to continue their employer-based health insurance for themselves and their families for up to 24 months. They are also entitled to immediate reinstatement of their health insurance upon reemployment. Wisconsin’s state military leave law applies to only permanent state employees called into active service. According to Wis. Stat. § 230.08 , the law applies when an eligible state employee is called “into active service in the armed forces of the United States or is requested to work for the federal government during a national emergency or a limited national emergency.” The active service period cannot be more than 4 years, and employees should be reinstated within 180 days after relief from service. Voting Leave in Wisconsin Wisconsin law requires employers to grant employees up to three hours of unpaid leave to vote in an election. However, employers must request vote leave in advance, and the employer may choose the time of day the leave is taken. Jury Duty Leave Wisconsin mandates that all employers provide employees selected for jury duty enough time off to participate in their civil duty. Employees who are summoned for jury duty are protected by state law from adverse employment actions. Employers cannot discharge or threaten to discharge an employee for taking time off to serve as a juror. Employers are not required to pay for jury duty leave. However, some employers pay for jury duty leave to encourage employees. The court compensates jurors in Wisconsin for their service at a rate of $16 a day. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave in Wisconsin is not mandated by law. Employers have full discretion to decide to offer bereavement leave as a benefit. However, most employers provide bereavement leave to allow their employees to take time off after the death of a loved one, typically a close family member. Most companies in the state offer up to 3 consecutive days off for bereavement. Civil Air Patrol Leave Wisconsin law allows employees who are members of the Civil Air Patrol to take unpaid leave for up to 15 days per year to participate in Civil Air Patrol missions. However, members cannot take more than 5 consecutive days off. Civil air patrol leave is for emergency missions only and can be approved if it does not unduly disrupt the company’s operations. Employers are prohibited from firing or disciplining employees for taking this leave. PTO Payout on Termination in Wisconsin In Wisconsin, the payout of accrued, unused vacation time upon termination of employment depends on the employer’s policies in the absence of any federal or state provision. If employers allow the payout of accrued, unused vacation time in company policy or any employment agreement, the employer must honor this agreement. Conversely, if the employer’s policy explicitly states that unused vacation time will not be paid out upon termination, the employer is not obligated to provide such a payout. When an employee is terminated or leaves voluntarily, Wisconsin employers must provide the employee’s final paycheck by the next regular payday or within 31 days, whichever is earlier.

If you are an employer in Oregon, it is essential to keep up with the updated PTO Laws to be compliant. We have created this guide to help employers understand the PTO compliance requirements. Table of Contents Overview of the New Oregon PTO Law Paid Leave Compensation FMLA Federal Law followed in Oregon The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) Parenting Leave under FMLA Birth and Bonding Leave Adoption and Foster Care Leave Serious Health Condition Leave under FMLA Oregon Sick Time Law and Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA) Types of Leave Under OFLA 1. Parental Leave 2. Serious Health Condition Leave 3. Military Family Leave 4. Pregnancy Disability Leave 5. Sick Child Leave 6. Bereavement Leave When Companies are eligible for both OFLA and FMLA, what do they do? Payout Requirements on Termination in Oregon Paid Time Off in Oregon Vacation Sick Leave Safe Leave (Sexual, Domestic Violence/Harassment, Stalking, etc.) Roll-Over/Carried-Forward Leaves Accruals Bereavement Leave Jury Duty Leave Military Leave Voting Leave Requirements for Employers regarding Paid Time Off in Oregon How Truein Can Help with Paid Time Off Management Conclusion Overview of the New Oregon PTO Law On January 1, 2023, the state of Oregon implemented the paid leave law, formally known as Paid Leave Oregon . This law allows all employees, irrespective of their employer size, to receive paid time off for up to 12 weeks. However, note that Paid Leave Oregon is not an exclusive PTO law, and it runs in conjunction with the existing Oregon Sick Time Law and the Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA). In addition, all employers must also consider federal regulations, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), to ensure full compliance with PTO laws. Paid Leave Compensation Under Paid Leave Oregon law, employers are not required to pay their employees; they are paid from the newly created state fund. Depending on your business size, you must contribute to the state fund as an employer. The employees and the rest contribute 60% of the total contribution rate, 40%, by the employer or the state of Oregon if the employer has 25 or fewer employees. The Oregon Sick Time Law provides paid or unpaid sick leave to employees, depending on the employer’s size. All employers with 10 or more employees must offer paid sick leave. Employers should pay 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked. New employees start earning paid time off as soon as they start working. However, employers can put a waiting period of 90 days before new employees can start using their paid time off. No employee can accrue more than 40 hours a year of paid sick time off. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is the federal law that employers should adhere to along with OFLA. Under federal law, employers should give employees 12 weeks of unpaid time off for medical and family emergencies. FMLA Federal Law followed in Oregon The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected annual leave for specific family and medical reasons. To be eligible for time off under FMLA, employees should have worked with their current employer for at least 12 months continuously, at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months, and at a site with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. Additionally, FMLA is an application for employers with 50 or more employees. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) In addition to the FMLA, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) applies to all employers in Oregon. This federal law prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The PDA requires employers to treat pregnant employees the same as other employees with similar abilities or limitations. This includes providing leave for pregnancy-related conditions if the employer provides leave for other temporary disabilities. Parenting Leave under FMLA All eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of maternity/paternity leave under FMLA. Employees can use this time off to care for a newborn child or a newly placed adopted or foster child. This leave is unpaid and generally is offered as an additional benefit. Birth and Bonding Leave Birth and bonding leave under FMLA allows eligible employees to take time off to bond with a newborn or newly placed adopted or foster child. It includes 12 weeks of unpaid time off. Adoption and Foster Care Leave FMLA also recognizes adoption and foster care as a reason for unpaid time off, similar to maternity/paternity leave. All eligible employees can ask for adoption or foster care leave of up to 12 weeks to care for an adopted or foster child newly placed in their home. Serious Health Condition Leave under FMLA Eligible employees can take time off under FMLA to care for themselves or a family member if they are suffering from a serious health condition. This leave is unpaid and doesn’t have accrual approval. It is included in the FMLA provision and allows employees to take up to 12 weeks. Oregon Sick Time Law and Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA) The Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA) is the state law that provides additional protection to employees if they work for an employer with 25 or more workers. Under OFLA, employees can take unpaid leave of up to 12 weeks for home care, pregnancy disability, bereavement, and legal procedures for foster care of a child. OFLA provides broader protections than the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and is designed to cover more employers and employees, including those at smaller businesses. Types of Leave Under OFLA 1. Parental Leave Parental leave is part of the FMLA provision that gives employees the right to unpaid time off to attend to parental responsibilities such as bonding with a new child after birth, adoption, or foster placement. All employers should provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid PTO for newborns or foster kids. 2. Serious Health Condition Leave Under OFLA, all employees can get up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off to care for themselves or a family member with a serious health condition. 3. Military Family Leave Military family leaves under OFLA provide up to 14 days of time off for employees to spend time with a family member in the military and on leave from active duty. 4. Pregnancy Disability Leave OFLA provides up to 12 weeks of leave for employees who are unable to work due to a pregnancy-related disability. It can be used before or after the birth of a child. 5. Sick Child Leave Sick child leave under OFLA allows employees to take time off to care for a sick child who requires home care but has no serious health condition. This leave can be up to 12 weeks a year, and is generally unpaid, but employers may offer paid or allow employees to use accrued paid leave. 6. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave allows employees to take time off following the death of a family member. Under OFLA, employers must provide up to two weeks of bereavement leave. When Companies are eligible for both OFLA and FMLA, what do they do? It can be challenging to decide as Oregon PTO laws include both OFLA and FMLA. Employers must coordinate the two as they can simultaneously count employees against OFLA and FMLA entitlements. If an employee needs FMLA or OFLA leave for multiple qualifying conditions or purposes simultaneously or in the same leave year, you can count them against FMLA and OFLA leaves. However, having more than one qualifying condition does not allow employees to extend their entitlement. Payout Requirements on Termination in Oregon Employers in Oregon are not required to pay accrued, unused vacation time on termination. This applies to all employees regardless of their employer period or type of employment. However, if there is a clear policy or agreement stating otherwise, employers must adhere to the policies agreed upon. Employers must maintain and communicate clear policies regarding vacation payout with employees to avoid disputes. Paid Time Off in Oregon Vacation Oregon doesn’t require employers to provide vacation days. It is at the sole discretion of the employers to provide vacation time off, paid or unpaid. Generally, most employers in the state offer vacation days as benefits for a competitive edge. Employers can set their vacation accrual, usage, and payout policies if they comply with state wage payment laws regarding accrued, unused vacation time. Sick Leave Oregon allows employees to earn 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. However, not all employers are required to offer paid sick leave. Under Oregon PTO law, employers with more than 10 employees must provide paid sick leave to employees up to 40 hours per year. Safe Leave (Sexual, Domestic Violence/Harassment, Stalking, etc.) Safe leave in Oregon allows employees to take time off to address issues related to sexual or domestic violence, harassment, or stalking. Effective January 1, 2024 , all employees can avail up to 160 hours of paid time off every year as safe leave. This time off is in addition to other PTO such as sick days, jury duty, etc. Roll-Over/Carried-Forward Leaves There is no state law on PTO accrual. The roll-over or carried-forward leave rules, such as vacation or paid time off (PTO), largely depend on company policy rather than specific state mandates. Employers can allow or disallow the roll-over of PTO, depending on their company policies. However, if an employer chooses to offer these benefits, they must adhere to the terms of their own established policies or employment contracts. Most employees allow rollover as a benefit; however, they cap the number of hours employees can carry forward to next year. If you plan to offer accrual and roll-over of leaves, you must: Clearly communicate such policies to employees, typically through an employee handbook or a written contract. If you implement a “use it or lose it” policy, describe that employees must use their vacation or PTO within a given timeframe or forfeit it. Provide information on how much vacation or PTO employees can accrue. If you cap the roll-over of PTO, tell employees then when they reach a certain limit, they cannot accrue more time until they use some of their stored leave. Accruals Paid sick leave is the only paid time off mandated by the Oregon PTO laws. Under the Oregon sick time law, employees accrue one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours per year. Employers can front-load sick leave at the beginning of the year or allow employees to accrue leave over time. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave in Oregon is provided under OFLA, requiring certain employees to offer up to 2 weeks of unpaid time off for bereavement. Employers with 25 or more employees must provide bereavement leave to employees to take time off following the death of a family member. The leave counts against an employee’s total OFLA entitlements. Typically unpaid, some employers choose to offer paid bereavement leave as a benefit. The leave can be taken for up to two weeks per family member within 60 days of receiving death notice. Jury Duty Leave Jury duty is a civic responsibility, and Oregon law requires employers to provide unpaid leave for employees to serve on a jury. Employers can put a notice requiring employees to show proof of their jury duty when they ask for leave. No employers can take retaliatory action against employees on jury duty leave. Jury duty leave is unpaid in Oregon. The court pays a daily stipend of $10 to jurors, and employers are not required to compensate employees for jury duty leave. Military Leave Under state and federal law, military employees in Oregon are given special protections and benefits. Oregon state law provides military leave for employees who serve in the Oregon National Guard or are members of other U.S. armed forces reserve components. However, state law requires that such employees report back to work within 7 days or be released from their duties. The Oregon Military Family Leave Act (OMFLA) also applies to employees working for an employer with 25 or more employees. Under OMFLA, eligible employees can take up to 2 weeks of unpaid leave for military family reasons. The federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) also applies to all employers in Oregon. Under USERRA, employers must allow employees called for active service up to 5 years of unpaid time off. Such employees can also continue their employer-based health insurance coverage for up to 24 months while on military leave. USERRA and Oregon state laws provide reemployment rights for employees returning from military service. The law requires employers to reemploy returning service members in the job they would have attained if they had not been absent for military service, with the same seniority, status, and pay. Voting Leave Oregon law does not require employers to provide paid or unpaid leave for employees to vote. However, employers cannot prevent employees from voting or penalize them for exercising their right to vote, given that employees don’t use their office hours to vote. Employers are encouraged to provide time off for employees to vote, particularly if they cannot vote during non-working hours. Requirements for Employers regarding Paid Time Off in Oregon Employers must be aware of the state and federal requirements for paid time off. Here are some essential requirements to know: Employers should put up a poster or communicate about the Paid Leave Oregon provision with employees without failing. Information to be shared includes employees’ rights, how to apply for Paid Leave in Oregon and their right to job protection. Creating fair policies to allow employees to be eligible for paid time off. Regularly submitting their employer contributions towards the state fund. Creating channels to collect and submit employee contributions to the state fund. Accurately reporting total employee numbers and total contributions to the state authorities.

However, the Pennsylvania PTO laws follow federal regulations, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), to primarily govern most PTO regulations. Exceptions exist, such as Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Allegheny County, that allow paid time off. Understanding the distinct interplay between federal and local regulations is crucial for employers to comply with PA PTO laws. In this guide, we examine the Pennsylvania PTO payout laws, including exceptions in counties. Table of Contents Overview of FMLA Rules in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Laws on Family and Medical Leave Which Pennsylvania Employers fall under FMLA coverage? Which Employees qualify for FMLA in Pennsylvania? How long is the FMLA Leave? Organ Donor Leave Pregnancy Leave Child Care Leave Local Laws for Paid Leave Sick Leave Laws in Philadelphia Sick Leave Eligibility Exemptions Accrual Requirements Leave Roll Over/Carried-Forward Requirements Sick Leave Laws in Allegheny County Sick Leave Eligibility Exemptions Accrual Requirements Leave Roll Over/Carried-Forward Requirements Sick Leave Laws in Pittsburgh Sick Leave Eligibility Exemptions Accrual Requirements Leave Roll Over/Carried-Forward Requirements PTO Payout on Termination in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Military Leave Pennsylvania Jury Duty Leave Additional State Laws in Pennsylvania Paid Holidays Paid Parental Leave Paid Bereavement Leave How Truein Can Help with Paid Time Off Management? Conclusion Overview of FMLA Rules in Pennsylvania The FMLA is the federal law enacted in 1993 to allow eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for qualified family and medical reasons. Pennsylvania requires all employers with 50 or more employees to adhere to the rules outlined by FMLA. Your employees can use FMLA time off for various reasons, including the birth of a child, adoption, personal or family illness, and family military leave. In addition to FMLA leave, Pennsylvania offers various other leave types, such as organ donor leave, pregnancy leave, child care leave, military leave, and jury duty leave, each with its eligibility requirements and benefits. Pennsylvania Laws on Family and Medical Leave The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a mandatory obligation for all private employers in Pennsylvania. While the state has no paid time off laws, it requires all employers to offer their employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for family and medical reasons, as underlined by the FMLA policies. What you need to know about employer coverage, employee eligibility, leave duration, and specific types of leave under FMLA is here. Which Pennsylvania Employers fall under FMLA coverage? The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) covers all private-sector employers that employ 50 or more employees for at least 20 workweeks in the current or previous calendar year. These 50 employees must be within 75 miles of the worksite. It also covers all public agencies, regardless of the number of employees, and all public and private elementary and secondary schools. Which Employees qualify for FMLA in Pennsylvania? Employees who have worked for their employer for at least 12 months, worked at least 1,250 hours in the past 12 months, and worked at a location where the employer has at least 50 employees within 75 miles are termed ‘eligible’ under FMLA. Furthermore, while the FMLA sets minimum leave standards, employers can provide more generous leave benefits if they choose to. How long is the FMLA Leave? Under FMLA, employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off. However, this period is only applicable for certain family and medical needs, such as: Serious health condition that makes an employee unable to perform job functions. Leave to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition. FMLA allows eligible employees to take leave for a child’s birth, adoption, or foster placement. Qualifying exigency if you have a family member on active duty or are called to covered active duty status in the Armed Forces. Military caregivers leave up to 26 weeks to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness. Organ Donor Leave Organ donor leave is a provision under FMLA and the Pennsylvania Living Donor Protection Act (LDPA). It allows employees who donate an organ or tissue to take time off to prepare and recover from the surgery. This type of leave is considered a “serious health condition,” allowing eligible employees to take time off for surgery and recovery without risking their job security. Eligibility for organ donor leave is the same as FMLA, i.e., it covers all employees who work for an employer with 50 or more employees. In Pennsylvania, at least 12 months of continuous employment with the same employer and at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months are mandatory to be eligible for organ donor leave. Pregnancy Leave Pregnancy leave is covered under the FMLA as a serious health condition. This allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during pregnancy or following childbirth. The leave can be used for prenatal care, pregnancy-related health issues, or recovery after childbirth. In addition to the FMLA, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is another federal law that protects the rights of pregnant women in the workplace. It prohibits any discrimination against pregnant women regarding hiring, firing, job assignments, pay, etc. Child Care Leave An employee can also use FMLA-paid time off for childcare, allowing eligible employees to take time off to care for a new child. Child care leave allows eligible employees to take time off for the birth and care of a newborn child within 12 months of birth. This leave can also be used for adoption or foster care placement. Local Laws for Paid Leave Employers need to be careful about certain local jurisdictions in Pennsylvania that have their own paid leave ordinances. If your business is located in Philadelphia, Allegheny County, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, then here are the PA PTO laws regarding paid sick leave, including eligibility criteria, exemptions, accrual requirements, and rollover provisions. Sick Leave Laws in Philadelphia Pennsylvania has no mandatory sick leave provisions, but Philadelphia employers must provide paid or unpaid sick leave depending on the business size. The ordinance ensures workers have time off to address their health needs or care for family members. Sick Leave Eligibility Employees in Philadelphia are eligible for sick leave if they work for at least 40 hours a year. If the employer has 10 or more employees, they should provide paid sick leave, while those with 9 or fewer employees must offer unpaid sick leave. The leave applies to both full-time and part-time employees, provided they meet the eligibility requirements. Exemptions There are certain categories of employees exempt from Philadelphia’s sick leave law. This includes: Independent contractors Seasonal workers Employees hired for less than 6 months Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements Interns State and federal employees Accrual Requirements Employees in Philadelphia accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours per year. New employees start accruing paid sick time from their start date, but employers can restrict the time they can use their accrued leave to up to 90 days. Leave Roll Over/Carried-Forward Requirements As Philadelphia allows a use-it-or-lose-it policy, employers are not required to allow the rollover of paid sick time to next year. However, it depends on company policies. Also, employees are not entitled to use more than 40 hours of sick leave per year unless the employer’s policy allows it. Sick Leave Laws in Allegheny County Allegheny County’s sick leave law mandates paid time off for employees for companies with 26 or more employees. Employers operating in Allegheny County should give preference to the country’s paid sick leave laws over state laws as they provide a more generous minimum amount of paid sick leave to eligible employees. Sick Leave Eligibility Employees who work for an employer with 26 or more employees in Allegheny County are eligible for paid sick leave, provided they work at least 35 hours in a year for the employer. This policy applies to both full-time and part-time employees. Exemptions These employees in Allegheny County are exempt from its sick leave law: Independent contractors Seasonal workers Accrual Requirements Employees in Allegheny County accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 35 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours per year. However, employees can allow a higher cap. Leave Roll Over/Carried-Forward Requirements Employers are not required to allow the carryover of unused sick leave in Allegheny County.  However, employers can choose to pay out unused sick leave at the end, as per their policies. Sick Leave Laws in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh is located within Allegheny County but has its sick leave policies. Employers in Pittsburgh must be aware of these laws to comply. The Pittsburgh sick leave represents a significant step toward supporting workers’ health and public safety by ensuring employees do not have to choose between their health and their paycheck. The Act applies to all private employers operating within the city limits of Pittsburgh, regardless of the size of their business. Sick Leave Eligibility Pittsburgh allows all employees to be eligible for sick leave provided they have worked at least 35 hours a year. Smaller employers with fewer than 15 employees can grant unpaid sick leave up to 24 hours per year. Employers with over 15 employees must provide paid sick leave accrued at one hour for every 35 hours worked. Exemptions Certain employees are exempt from Pittsburgh’s sick leave law, including: Independent contractors Seasonal workers Employees who are part of construction union covered by collective bargaining agreements State and federal workers Accrual Requirements Employees in Pittsburgh accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 35 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours per year. For employers with fewer than 15 employees, the maximum accrual is 24 hours of sick leave per year. Leave Roll Over/Carried-Forward Requirements Unused sick leave in Pittsburgh cannot be carried forward to the following year. Employees are not entitled to use more than 40 hours of sick leave in a year unless the employer’s policy allows for more. PTO Payout on Termination in Pennsylvania There are no Pennsylvania PTO payout laws mandating employers pay for accrued, unused vacation time to employees upon termination. The company policies govern all actions regarding the same. When employment ends, whether due to resignation, retirement, or termination, what happens to unused vacation time is generally determined by the employment contract, collective bargaining agreement, or the employer’s established policy. If an employment contract or agreement explicitly states how unused vacation time is handled upon termination, it will be legally binding. The employer must honor this agreement. Conversely, if the contract states unused vacation time will not be paid out, the employer is not obligated to provide compensation. Pennsylvania Military Leave Pennsylvania protects the employment of employees who are in service in the armed forces. The federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and the Pennsylvania Military Affairs Act define the guidelines for employers on how PTO for such employees should be handled. USERRA allows service members to take up to 5 years of unpaid time off for military service. It allows service members to continue their employer-based health insurance coverage for up to 24 months while absent from military service. The law protects service members from discrimination in employment based on their military service. The Pennsylvania Military Affairs Act furthers the protections the USERRA provides for employees called to active duty or required to attend training as members of the Pennsylvania National Guard or other reserve components. The act states that such employees should be reinstated to the same seniority, status, and pay upon return from military service. Pennsylvania Jury Duty Leave In Pennsylvania, employers are required to provide employees with leave to serve on a jury or attend jury selection. All employees, whether full-time, part-time, or temporary are entitled to jury duty leave. Employers must provide employees with unpaid time off for jury duty without any workplace repercussions. Employers must not force employees to use any other type of PTO, such as paid sick time off, for jury duty. Employers are not required to pay employees for time off for jury duty. However, the courts in Pennsylvania pay employees serving on jury duty at $9.00 a day for the first three days of the service, then $25 a day. However, jury duty PA PTO laws don’t apply to employees in retail and service industries with fewer than 15 employees and manufacturing businesses with less than 40 employees. Additional State Laws in Pennsylvania In Pennsylvania, the provision of paid holidays, parental leave, and bereavement leave varies across employers. Paid Holidays While some employers offer paid holidays as part of their benefits package, others may not provide this perk. The decision to offer paid holidays typically depends on individual company policies and organizational culture. Paid Parental Leave Unlike some states with specific laws mandating paid parental leave, Pennsylvania does not have such requirements. As a result, the availability of paid parental leave varies among employers, with some offering generous benefits while others may not provide any paid time off for new parents. Paid Bereavement Leave Similarly, the availability of paid bereavement leave in Pennsylvania is determined by individual employers. While some companies offer paid time off to grieve the loss of a loved one, others may provide unpaid leave or have specific policies addressing bereavement situations. Overall, the landscape of additional state laws related to paid time off in Pennsylvania highlights the discretion of employers and the importance of understanding company policies. Employees should inquire about these benefits when joining a new organization or refer to their employee handbook for clarification. How Truein Can Help with Paid Time Off Management?

There are many factors to consider when devising a shift plan that ensures the workload is evenly distributed. Shift management is a skill that can be learned if you know the workflow of the shift management process and best practices. That’s precisely what this guide is all about; we are about to reveal the blueprint for managing shift schedules successfully every time. Table of Contents What is Shift Management?

How Truein Helps with Shift Scheduling? Conclusion FAQs Q. What factors should be considered when creating shift schedules? Q. What tools or software can I use for shift management? Q. What exactly is Employee Shift Management Software? What is Shift Management? Shift management is the systematic approach to planning, organizing, and overseeing organizational work shifts. Whether you employ a few workers or depend on a large workforce, you need effective schedules to ensure all necessary tasks are covered throughout the operational hours, which often span 24 hours a day. However, do not mistake shift management for simply filling time slots; it goes much more profoundly in aligning workforce capacity with business demands, optimizing employee productivity, and maintaining operational efficiency. Why is Shift Management Critical for Business Operations? Businesses can only succeed with effective shift management, especially outside traditional business hours. Even if you are not a business that operates continuously 24 hours, here’s why shift management is still critical for your business operations: It ensures continuous operation, which can be critical for the Construction, Manufacturing, Supply Chain & Logistics, Facility Management, Hospitality and Retail industries. By aligning workforce schedules with peak demand times, shift management helps businesses optimize productivity. Well-planned shifts that consider employee preferences and provide a fair distribution of work contribute to higher job satisfaction. Effective shift management can help reduce labor costs by minimizing overtime and optimizing staffing levels, eliminating overstaffing and understaffing. Scheduling is also mandatory to adhere to labor laws and regulations regarding working hours, rest periods, and overtime. Types of Shift Schedules As dynamic, the needs of various industries are the same versatile as the types of shift schedules. Depending on the operational needs of your business and employee availability and preferences, you can choose from one of the following shift schedules. Fixed Shifts The typical ‘9 to 5’ shift falls under fixed shifts that involve employees working the same hours on the same days each week. A fixed shift schedule provides a consistent routine for employees and employers, making it easier to plan personal activities and meet operational needs. Rotating Shifts Rotating shifts require employees to work different shifts over a set period, such as alternating between day and night shifts weekly. It is common in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. Rotating shifts maintains fairness at work by distributing less desirable shifts (e.g., night shifts) more evenly among employees. Split Shifts Split shifts are standard in restaurants where peak business hours are limited to certain hours. It divides the workday into two or more separate periods with substantial breaks in between. For example, an employee can work from 8 am to 12 pm and then take a break to return to work from 5 pm to 9 pm. Split shits allow businesses to cover peak demand times effectively, such as lunch and dinner rushes in restaurants. On-Call Shifts On-call employees agree to work on employer demand. On-call shifts require employees to be available to work at short notice, often to cover unexpected absences or peak demand periods. It is helpful for businesses where sudden staffing needs arise frequently. Compressed Workweek A compressed workweek involves employees working longer hours over fewer days rather than conventional shifts for more days, such as four 10-hour days instead of five 8-hour days. It gives businesses more work hours while employees benefit from additional days off. Flexible Shifts Flexible shifts allow employees to choose their work hours within certain limits set by the employer. Businesses that employ freelancers commonly have flexible shifts as they accommodate employees’ schedules and preferences. However, flexible shifts require effective communication and coordination to cover all shifts without gaps. Staggered Shifts Staggered shifts involve employees starting and ending their workdays at different times, even within the same shift type. For instance: Sarah: 9 am to 5 pm John: 10 am to 6 pm William: 11am to 7 pm Staggered shifts are helpful for businesses like restaurants and hospitals where staff is needed throughout the day, but there are distinct busy periods. How Can You Plan Shift Management Effectively? The shift management process gets more straightforward if you know a few fundamental requirements. Follow through with these steps to manage your shift schedule easily. Understand Operational Needs The ultimate aim of shifts is to ensure that all business operational needs are matched with staffing availability. Hence, the first step is identifying the core functions that must be covered during each shift. Understand peak times for customer demand or production output to ensure sufficient coverage. Analyze Workload and Staffing Requirements Once you understand the core requirements of your operations, evaluate the workload these operations put on each shift and determine the number of employees needed. Here, it would help if you considered factors like skill requirements, employee availability, and regulatory requirements. Define Shift Types Based on the operational requirements, number of employees, and skillset, determine the types of shifts that will best meet the operational needs. You can also choose more than one type of shift for scheduling. Establish Shift Rotation Policies If your business requires shift rotation, you must ensure fairness such that everyone gets undesired shifts and even workload to prevent burnout. Communicate these policies to employees and provide training if necessary. Consider Employee Preferences Do more than enforce shift schedules on your workers. Consider employee preferences and availability when scheduling shifts to improve job satisfaction and reduce turnover. Utilize Scheduling Software Shift management is easier said than done on paper, mainly if you employ many workers. Leverage a staff scheduling software like Truein to automate and streamline the shift planning process. Such tools can help with reporting & analytics, shift swapping, and compliance with labor laws. Implement Clear Communication Channels Multiple communication channels like emails, messaging apps, and bulletin boards convey shift schedules. Ensure that employees are well informed about their schedules and any changes. Monitor and Adjust Schedules Regularly review and adjust schedules to address issues such as understaffing, overstaffing, or changes in demand. Allow scope for flexibility to respond to unexpected changes and maintain smooth operations. Address Employee Burnout You must be proactive to recognize the signs of employee burnout resulting from shift schedules. If such signs occur, offer sufficient breaks and support for mental and physical well-being. Seek Feedback and Continuous Improvement Regularly seek employee feedback about the scheduling process and their input on shift schedules. Use this feedback to make continuous improvements to shift management practices. 10 Strategies to Improve Shift Management & Scheduling If you need help with shift management, you may be required to adopt new strategies to improve the process. Here are the top 10 strategies that benefit businesses of all sizes, irrespective of their industry. Understand Employee Availability and Preferences Ensure your shift management process is built around individual employee preferences and availability whenever possible. It will help you create a more employee-friendly schedule. Provide Regular Training and Support One issue that can lead to the failure of shift schedules is that your staff needs to be adequately trained. Ensure that all employees are skilled to support and perform their duties during their shifts. Cross-Train Employees Cross-train employees so they can take up different roles when required. If your employees can handle multiple roles, it increases flexibility and coverage. Establish Clear Shift-Swap Policies If you allow shift-swap, clear and consistent shift-swap policies ensure that shift changes are managed smoothly and without disruptions to operations. Using scheduling software like Truein enables employees to quickly request and manage shift swaps. Implement Advanced Scheduling Software Furthermore, leveraging advanced scheduling software automates the scheduling process, saving time and reducing errors. It can help you generate optimal schedules based on predefined rules and employee availability. Gather and Act on Employee Feedback Regularly seeking and acting on employee feedback is essential for improving shift schedules. Conduct regular surveys and polls, provide anonymous suggestion boxes, and hold periodic feedback sessions to discuss and address common issues. Analyze Shift Performance Data-driven decision-making is crucial. Monitor and analyze shift performance to identify trends, improvement areas, and changes’ impact. Communicate Clearly and Consistently Transparent communication ensures that employees are well informed about their schedules and any changes, reducing confusion and errors. Maintain an open-door policy where employees can ask questions and seek clarification about their schedules. Offer Flexible Shift Options Offering flexible shift options helps employees balance their work and personal lives, leading to higher job satisfaction and retention. Offer part-time shifts for those who need or prefer shorter work hours. Implement job-sharing arrangements where two or more employees share the responsibilities of one full-time position. Create Fair and Equitable Schedules Ensuring that shifts are distributed fairly among employees promotes a sense of fairness and reduces resentment. Rotation shifts are best for evenly distributing less desirable shifts. Shift Management Best Practices Regular Reviews Regular reviews of shift schedules and employee performance should be conducted to identify areas for improvement. Reviewing performance on a regular basis is crucial, are there overlaps or gaps that need to be addressed? Are the employees performing well? Such data-driven reviews and analysis help in getting knowledge about your approach Comply with Labor Laws Any shift schedule you create, ensure that it complies with relevant state and federal labor laws and regulations to avoid legal issues. Use Scheduling Software Scheduling software can significantly improve shift schedule management by automating and optimizing the scheduling process, saving time and reducing errors. Modern shift scheduling should include tools that streamline the task of creating shift schedules, keeping in mind factors such as employee skills, availability as well as compliance requirements. Provide Clear Communication Ensure open and consistent communication with your employees to keep them informed about their schedules and any changes. Effective shift management creates a powerful system for sharing the shift changes, updates and emergencies. As a consequence, you can ensure that employees are informed promptly and they can adapt to changes. Always ensure that you set clear communication and guidelines for requesting the shift changes. Through promoting open communication and responsiveness, you can actually simplify shift management and also build togetherness. Importance & Benefits of Shift Management Effective shift management is essential for the smooth business operations of many businesses. It ensures the correct number of employees with the appropriate skills are available and has far-reaching positive impacts on an organization.
